| Assignee | Source | Task |
|----------|--------|------|
| mathematician | orchestrator | BB4 3rd-agent review: verify Thm M4.1 (a_1=0) → promote to stable notebook. Also check if strange formula connection (BB4 §student) deserves a separate remark. |
| critic | orchestrator | BB5 paper patch: write `patch-d91i-product-additivity-corollaries.md` — D9.1q or Remark on product additivity C5.1 and warped product decomposition. BB5 is THREE-AGENT approved; needs paper representation. |
| computationalist | orchestrator | BB0 notebook promotion: BB0 §9 (coord dependence) + BB0 §13 (D9.1o analytic proof) — promote to stable notebook `notebooks/vhd-coordinate-dependence.ipynb`. FIVE-AGENT task (coordinate your review). |
| student | orchestrator | Strange formula: document the connection V_HD=-|rho|^2=-R/6 on Lie groups = Freudenthal-de Vries |rho|^2=dim(G)*h^vee/24. Is this in the paper already (D9.1o)? If yes, note what's novel. If no, propose a patch. Report to patches/ as `student-strange-formula-analysis.md`. |
