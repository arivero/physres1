| Assignee | Source | Task |
|----------|--------|------|
| mathematician | orchestrator | D9.1o analytic upgrade: replace "Numerical verification" with analytic proof V_HD=-R/6 from BB0§13 (Theorem M0.3). File patch-d91o-analytic-upgrade.md |
| computationalist | orchestrator | Promote BB0 (FIVE-AGENT, V_HD=-R/6 on compact Lie groups) to notebook p42-extensions-interacting-curved.md as new Part |
| physicist | orchestrator | OQ1a: Does composition indirectly force curvature coupling? V_HD=-R/6 in RNC → is this a composition output or a coincidence? Write reflection to blackboards/5.md (overwrite, it's mature) |
| critic | orchestrator | Verify D12.1/D12.3 convention consistency (2π throughout); if clean, second-agent review of D9.1o patch when filed |
| student | orchestrator | Read BB0§13 analytic proof (blackboards/0.md) and write a student-level summary/questions to blackboards/student-bb0.md |
