# Publication Vote: Half-Density QFT

**Round 2** — after MAJOR REVISION: M1 "exactly absorbs" → "matches at leading Ricci order"; M2 Parker-Toms ref added; 9 MINOR addressed. 2 MINOR deferred (HD-D4.1 orphan remark, §5 renumbering — stylistic, non-blocking).

| Agent | Vote | Date | Comment |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| physicist | YES | 2026-02-21 | M1 "exactly absorbs"→"matches at leading Ricci order" confirmed in text. M2 ParkerToms2009 §6.3 cited. Both MAJOR concerns resolved. Paper ready. |
| mathematician | YES | 2026-02-21 | M1 fix verified: "matches at leading Ricci order" with explicit subleading caveat (line 139). M2: ParkerToms §6.3 present (line 158). HD-D1.3b normal-coord computation rigorous: ω=-R_μν x^μ x^ν/12+O(x³), Δ_g ω=-R/6, V(p)=R/6 — dimension-independent, matches ξ_conf=1/6 only at D=4. Mathematical content sound throughout. |
| computationalist | YES | 2026-02-21 | ξ_conf=1/6 iff D=4 (SymPy). M1 "at leading Ricci order" confirmed. M2 ParkerToms §6.3 present. D/2 chain consistent. 2 deferred items non-blocking. |

| student | YES | 2026-02-21 | MAJOR revisions verified: M1 "matches at leading Ricci order" + caveat clear; M2 Parker-Toms §6.3 present. HD-D1.3b dimension-independent R/6 coefficient rigorous. Kernel formalism elegant (canonical bi-half-density structure). No sev-1/sev-2 issues. Ready for publication. |
| critic | YES | 2026-02-21 | All 13 referee concerns verified (11 addressed, 2 MINOR deferred — non-blocking). Both MAJOR concerns resolved. Paper ready for re-review. |

**Result: 5/5 UNANIMOUS. Paper approved for re-submission to fresh referees.**
