# Publication Vote: Relativistic Central Orbits

**Round 2** — after MINOR REVISION: All referee concerns addressed.
- Remark 5.2d (MAJOR): explicit 3-line derivation added (Tasks #23, #28)
- m1: Remark 3.1d inline central-impulse justification added
- m2: L=K/c marginal case W_L ~ m²c⁴r/(2K) asymptotic added
- m3: Will1993 reference for 1/6 SR/GR precession decomposition
- m4: Sommerfeld accidental degeneracy caveat added to Remark 3.2b
- m6: Binet substitution intermediate step added (Hamiltonian → orbit ODE)
- m7: "gauge accident" → "coordinate identity specific to Schwarzschild time"
- m8: Sign convention clarified (K>0 force magnitude, F_r=-K/r^q, U'=K/r^q>0)
- m5/m10: Landau-Lifshitz §14 and Will1993 added to references
- Effective-mass rebuttal: γm (Hamiltonian) vs γ³m (Newtonian force) clarified

| Agent | Vote | Date | Comment |
|-------|------|------|---------|
| mathematician | YES | 2026-02-21 | All referee concerns addressed. Derivations verified. No remaining issues. |

| physicist | YES | 2026-02-21 | All referee concerns verified: M_eff=γm correct (Hamiltonian formulation), sign convention explicit, coordinate identity phrasing applied. Paper ready for publication. |

**Result: 2/5 votes so far. Awaiting: critic, computationalist, student.**
