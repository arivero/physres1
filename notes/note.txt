  Yes, classical mechanics was genuinely in doubt of being consistent — and the parallel is deep                              
                                                                                                                                
  The historical episode your paper is channeling                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
  Your paper opens with Berkeley's 1734 Analyst critique for good reason: it was not philosophical nitpicking but a correct
  identification of a genuine logical gap. Newton's method required an increment o to be simultaneously nonzero (to divide by
  it) and zero (to eliminate residual terms). Berkeley nailed the contradiction: the reasoning that justified calculus was
  logically incoherent, even though the results were empirically correct.

  The crisis lasted ~130 years (1734 → Cauchy 1821 → Weierstrass 1860s). During this entire period:

  - Multiple major mathematicians (Maclaurin, d'Alembert, Lagrange, Euler) attempted repairs — every attempt before Cauchy was
  either incomplete or incorrect
  - The mathematical community knew the foundations were shaky and discussed it openly
  - Practitioners used calculus anyway because it worked — adopting what was essentially an empirical attitude toward a
  deductive science
  - Real mathematical disputes (the vibrating string controversy of the 1740s–60s) could not be adjudicated because the
  foundational apparatus didn't exist

  This is exactly the situation your paper diagnoses: "classical mechanics often hides [the refinement problem] by treating
  'send the refinement parameter to zero' as an axiomatically legitimate operation" (Introduction, line 16).

  The structural parallel to your paper's argument

  The parallel between the calculus crisis and renormalization is precise — and your paper is, in a sense, making this parallel
  explicit as a program:

  ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                Calculus (18th c.)                 │             Renormalization (20th c.)              │
  ├───────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

  │ Revealed new structures (Lebesgue, distributions) │ Revealed universality, fixed points, EFT           │
  └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Your Heuristic H0.2 (the three failure modes: singular probes, non-uniqueness, divergence) is essentially a taxonomy of all
  the ways "refine → 0" can fail, and the paper's thesis is that quantization and renormalization are the two control mechanisms
   that handle cases 2 and 3 when the naive Newtonian limit (case 1, handled by distributions) is insufficient.

  Classical field theories that are still in this pre-Cauchy state

  Here's where the question gets sharp. Several classical theories have open consistency problems right now, analogous to the
  pre-1821 status of calculus:

  1. Classical electrodynamics with point charges — genuinely inconsistent as a mathematical theory. The self-energy of a point
  charge is infinite; the Abraham-Lorentz radiation-reaction equation has runaway solutions and preacceleration. No consistent
  formulation exists. This is not a quantum problem — it's an internal failure of the classical framework.
  2. Navier-Stokes — unknown whether smooth solutions exist globally (Clay Millennium Prize). If finite-time blowup occurs, the
  classical deterministic description simply fails.
  3. Classical GR — well-posed as an initial value problem (Choquet-Bruhat 1952), but its own evolution generically drives
  solutions into singularities (Penrose-Hawking theorems). Whether these are always hidden behind horizons (cosmic censorship)
  remains unproven after 55+ years.
  4. Newtonian N-body gravity — even this! Xia (1992) proved that for N ≥ 5, bodies can escape to infinity in finite time via
  gravitational slingshots. The solution ceases to exist. For N = 3, triple collisions generally cannot be regularized (Siegel
  1941). The theory is incomplete for certain initial data.

  What this means for your paper's foundational argument

  Your paper's argument is genuinely foundational because it identifies the common structure behind all these consistency
  problems: they are all refinement-limit failures. The Refinement Compatibility Principle (P10.1) is essentially saying:

  A theory is admissible when "refine and compare" closes — when composing finer descriptions lands you back in the same family
  after a controlled parameter update.

  The historical arc is:
  - Stage 0→1 (calculus crisis): "refine → 0" for difference quotients required epsilon-delta control. Took 130 years.
  - Stage 1→2 (your P4.2): composition of propagators forces ℏ as a structural constant. The classical limit ℏ→0 is singular
  precisely because it tries to undo a forced completion.
  - Stage 2→3 (renormalization): infinite-mode assembly requires RG flow to maintain consistency across scales.
  - Stage 4 (your Remark P9.1a): composition over dynamical geometry — the domain of the integral itself becomes problematic.
  This is where we are now.

  The deep point is that classical mechanics was in exactly the same epistemic position in 1750 that classical field theories
  are in now: practitioners knew the foundations had gaps, the results worked anyway, and the resolution required new
  mathematical structure that nobody had yet invented. The calculus crisis was resolved by Cauchy/Weierstrass. The classical-ED
  and Navier-Stokes crises are still open. Your paper frames the entire history as one continuous refinement-consistency problem
   — which is what makes the argument foundational rather than merely pedagogical.

  The forced-completion chain of Remark P9.1 makes this most explicit: each stage is the minimum enrichment of the composition
  law needed for consistency, and removing any stage (e.g., ℏ→0) is catastrophic because it tries to undo a forced completion.
  The fact that the N-body problem already exhibits non-collision singularities for N ≥ 5 shows that even the Newtonian starting
   point of your chain has internal consistency issues that are resolved only by the regularization methods your paper discusses
   in Section 3 (Remark H1.2a: convergence fails at the r = 0 collision singularity where the Lipschitz condition breaks down)
