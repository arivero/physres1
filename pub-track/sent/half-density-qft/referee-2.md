# Referee Report: Half-Densities in QFT: Propagators as Bi-Half-Density Kernels

**Referee:** referee-2
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Paper:** pub-track/sent/half-density-qft/main.md

## Summary

The paper argues that spacetime propagators in QFT should be understood as bi-half-density kernels, making the identity kernel canonical and kernel composition coordinate-invariant without a background measure. The argument is organized around three threads: (1) a worked computation densitizing a curved-background scalar field via ψ = |g|^{1/4} φ; (2) a remark chain showing that the D/2 exponent unifies the normalization of the identity kernel, the heat kernel short-time behavior, the flat propagator prefactor, and UV divergence degrees; and (3) a kernel-level account of contact terms and counterterms as distributions supported on the diagonal. The paper is explicitly scoped as expository and connective rather than as a source of new theorems.

## Strengths

- The organizing idea is sound and cleanly stated: the bi-half-density language makes the identity kernel canonical, removes hidden measure conventions from propagator definitions, and makes kernel composition intrinsic.
- The remark chain in Sections 4–5 is the paper's strongest contribution. Remarks HD-D4.2, HD-D4.4, HD-D4.5, HD-D5.3, and HD-D5.3b form a coherent thread showing that the D/2 exponent is not a numerical coincidence but has a single origin in half-density volume-scaling. The proper-time integral as the bridge from heat-kernel t^{-D/2} to propagator Γ(D/2-1) is correctly stated and illuminating.
- Remark HD-D1.3b (universal 1/6 coefficient from normal-coordinate expansion) is technically precise: the computation of ω = (1/4)ln|g|, its Laplacian at p, and the identification with the a_1 Seeley-DeWitt coefficient are all correct and the match with conformal coupling only at D=4 is accurately stated.
- Remark HD-D1.3a carefully distinguishes half-density conjugation from conformal coupling (the Yamabe operator). This is a genuinely useful clarification that is often elided in the literature.
- References are appropriate: Bates-Weinstein (canonical source for half-density formalism), Hörmander (Schwartz kernel theorem), Vassilevich (heat kernel asymptotics), DeWitt, Wald. No obvious gaps for the stated scope.
- Scope management is good: BV, full curved-background interacting QFT, and the Planck-area program are all explicitly deferred rather than overpromised.

## Weaknesses

### MAJOR

- **Remark HD-D1.3b: claim about ξ_conf = 1/6 at D=4 needs a cleaner statement.** The paper writes "the half-density weight exactly absorbs the conformal coupling" in D=4. This phrasing conflates two distinct things: (a) that ξ_conf = (D-2)/(4(D-1)) equals 1/6 only at D=4, and (b) that the leading-order curvature potential generated by half-density conjugation is +R/6. The implication that D=4 is singled out by the coincidence ξ_conf = 1/6 is correct as stated, but the phrase "exactly absorbs" suggests the total curvature coupling of the half-density-conjugated, conformally-coupled scalar is zero at D=4. This is only true at leading curvature order (the R term), not beyond (R^2, R_μν R^{μν}, ... enter at next order). The paper partially addresses this with "at leading order" but the phrase "exactly absorbs" in the body contradicts the qualifier. This is not a computation error but a clarity failure with potential to mislead; it should be sharpened.

- **Missing reference: Avramidi or Parker-Toms for curved-background propagators.** The paper cites Vassilevich comprehensively for heat kernel asymptotics but does not cite any reference for the relation G̃(x,y) = |g(x)|^{1/4} G_g(x,y) |g(y)|^{1/4} beyond the statement that it "is exactly the same structure used for QM propagators." In the QFT context, this half-density form of the curved-space propagator kernel is discussed explicitly in, e.g., Parker-Toms *Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime* (Cambridge, 2009) and in Avramidi's work on the covariant perturbation theory of heat kernels. The absence of a QFT-on-curved-spacetime reference for this specific identity is a gap at the level of the paper's own stated scope.

### MINOR

- **Section 3, Derivation HD-D1.3:** The expansion of Δ_g in conformal coordinates is correct. However, the resulting expression for W̃Δ (equation after "Setting φ = |g|^{-1/4}ψ") omits the cross term −2 ∂σ · ∂ψ from being clearly labeled. In the current layout, a reader expanding derivatives manually will produce this term but must verify it matches the paper's expression; a single-line "expanding product rule gives cross term..." would help.

- **Remark HD-D4.2a:** The claim that the Atiyah-Singer index theorem follows from a_{D/2} "up to normalization" is accurate but the qualifier is doing heavy work. The McKean-Singer formula gives index(D) = Tr_s(e^{-tD*D}) = Tr_s(e^{-tDD*}) (independent of t), and the Seeley-DeWitt expansion then identifies the index with ∫ a_{D/2}, but the full statement requires the operator to be Dirac-type and the coefficient to be the appropriate characteristic class integrand (Â-genus, etc.). As written, a reader might think the Seeley-DeWitt coefficient a_{D/2} is directly the index integrand for any elliptic operator, which is not true. "Dirac-type operator" is stated, but the connection to characteristic classes is absent. This is an acceptable omission for the paper's scope but should be flagged as such, e.g., "in the Dirac case, a_{D/2} is (up to normalization) the Â-genus integrand; we do not spell this out here."

- **Remark HD-D4.5 / [PathIntegralNormalization] citation:** The internal citation [PathIntegralNormalization] refers to another paper in this program. The reference list does not contain an entry for it. If this is a companion paper not yet published externally, the reference should be flagged as "companion note" or "in preparation" rather than appearing in bracket notation that implies a published source.

- **Section 5, Remark HD-D5.1:** The claim that ∂_{x^μ} δ^{(D)}(x−y) = −∂_{y^μ} δ^{(D)}(x−y) "has a clean, connection-free formulation via Lie derivative on the identity kernel" is presented as a result of this paper. However, the coordinate identity is a textbook distribution fact and the Lie-derivative formulation is standard in the half-density/geometric quantization literature (e.g., Guillemin-Sternberg). The phrase "has a clean, connection-free formulation" implies this observation is new here, which overstates its novelty. Rephrase to "can be seen cleanly as..."

- **Abstract:** The abstract mentions "scalarization scales and RG as compatibility" as developed "elsewhere" without a pointer. At minimum, give the companion paper title or tag.

## Verdict

**Recommendation:** MINOR REVISION

**Justification:** The paper is technically correct, well-scoped, and the D/2 remark chain is a genuine organizational contribution. Two targeted fixes are needed: sharpening the "absorbs conformal coupling" phrasing in Remark HD-D1.3b to avoid the misleading implication of an exact cancellation beyond leading order, and adding a QFT-on-curved-spacetime reference (Parker-Toms or Avramidi) for the G̃ = |g|^{1/4} G_g |g|^{1/4} identity. The minor items (cross-term clarity, index-theorem qualifier, internal citation format, novelty phrasing in HD-D5.1, abstract pointer) can be addressed together without re-review.

## Detailed Comments

**On the MAJOR items:**

1. Remark HD-D1.3b, sentence "the half-density weight exactly absorbs the conformal coupling": replace with something like "in D=4, the half-density conjugation potential R/6 matches the conformal coupling ξ_conf R = R/6 exactly at leading (Ricci scalar) order; subleading curvature terms are not affected." This is factually the same as what the remark proves but does not invite the misreading that the total curvature dependence cancels.

2. Section 4, around equation K̃(P^{-1})(x,y) = |g(x)|^{1/4} G_g(x,y) |g(y)|^{1/4}: add a citation such as "[Parker-Toms2009, §6.3]" or "[Avramidi2000]" for this identity in the QFT context, alongside the existing [BatesWeinstein1997] [deGosson2018ShortTimePropagators] which cover the QM case.

**On the MINOR items:**

3. HD-D1.3: add one line "the product rule produces a cross term −2(∂σ)(∂ψ)" before writing down the full expression for W̃Δψ.

4. HD-D4.2a: add "(in the Dirac case, a_{D/2} is the Â-genus integrand; the general characteristic class connection is beyond this note's scope)."

5. [PathIntegralNormalization]: change to "(companion note, in preparation)" or give the actual title if it exists in the repo.

6. HD-D5.1: change "has a clean, connection-free formulation" to "can be seen cleanly."

7. Abstract: add "(see [companion paper title or tag])" after "developed elsewhere."
