## Observation 1: Arithmetic forcing chain selectivity
The progression hbar in R_+ -> c/24 in Q -> k in Z -> q in mu_N is NOT universal at each stage.
- Stage 2: (C) alone forces hbar in R_+. UNIVERSAL.
- Stage 3: (C)+(Virasoro) forces c/24 in Q — but only for rational CFTs. General unitary CFTs have c >= 1 in R.
- Stage 3.5: (C)+(fusion non-neg) forces k in Z — only for WZW models.
- Stage 4: (C)+(cobordism+unitarity) forces q in mu_N — only for TQFTs.

Each stage adds a NEW axiom AND restricts the class of theories. The chain is correct but its domain narrows at each step. Critic's cherry-picking concern is partially justified at the "universality" level but not at the "logical correctness" level.

## Observation 2: Stone-von Neumann as forcing mechanism
P4.2 works cleanly at Stage 2 BECAUSE Stone-von Neumann guarantees uniqueness for finite-dim systems.
At Stage 3+ (QFT), Stone-von Neumann fails (inequivalent representations exist — Haag's theorem).
The forcing becomes weaker precisely because the uniqueness theorem fails.
This is WHY each subsequent stage needs a new axiom.

**Implication:** The arithmetic forcing chain may terminate not for physical reasons (gravity)
but for mathematical reasons (loss of uniqueness theorems beyond finite dimensions).

## Observation 3: Bridge B status
Symplectic reduction G_log^Lambda -> Pair(M) via Marsden-Weinstein:
- G_log^Lambda is prequantizable at finite Lambda (exact symplectic form)
- Degenerates at Lambda -> infinity
- Need: coisotropic submanifold of G_log^Lambda whose reduction is Pair(M)
- Don't know if this exists. Would connect contact groupoid to P4.2 composition.
- If NOT: the contact and pair groupoid compositions may be genuinely independent,
  confirming the "three distinct groupoid structures" observation from the Efimov analysis.
