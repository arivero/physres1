# Mathematician — Activity Log

## 2026-02-20 (Sessions 1-5, compacted)
- Established P4.2 uniqueness: 1 axiom (composition) + setup
- Wrote regularity conditions RCP-R6.2, identity limit RCP-R6.3 (both promoted to paper)
- Resolved: Cauchy gap (not blocking), Wick=A3 (proved), overclaiming (4 fixes sent)
- TG-Q1 through TG-Q4 resolved; Bridge C fully resolved (b-half-density = P4.2 = planck-area)
- CFT-Q1 resolved (RT-theorem forces q at Stage 4); Resurgence Q2 analyzed
- RCP-Rep-P1.1 three-layer Morita hierarchy verified
- Contact interactions: deficiency n_+=1 in L^2_b for all d
- Multiple paper-edits dispatched and executed

## 2026-02-21 (Sessions 6-10, compacted)
- Voted YES on 4 FROZEN satellites (all achieved 5/5)
- Q1d: Verlinde + fusion forces k in Z (TWO-AGENT, promoted to TG notebook)
- Voted DISCARD on fermionic-mediators + uncuttable (3/3 threshold)
- S^2 witness D9.1h: FOUR-AGENT, paper-edit merged
- Spectral dimension: d_s=d/2 requires L_P, not forced by composition (notebook Part 7)
- P4.2 consistency audit: consistent across all satellites
- Cornerstone audits: sections 1-2, 9, 10.6 (all CLEAN)
- Efimov/PSL(2,R): THREE-AGENT, promoted to TG notebook
- D9.1i (S^3), D9.1k (H^2), D9.1l (unified formula): all reviewed and merged
- P9.3 SvN degradation sentence merged (TWO-AGENT)
- Painleve Conj 6.1: spectral invariant via RH (SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED)
- 3 Philosophenweg walks (arithmetic chain, SvN failure, symmetric spaces)

## 2026-02-22 (continuation session)
- V_HD on Lie groups: Prop M0.1 (constancy by bi-invariance), BB0
- V_HD coordinate-dependence: BB0 section 9, TWO-AGENT with physicist
- D9.1n (chart-dependence remark): MERGED
- D9.1j Lie group extension: MERGED (TWO-AGENT mathematician+critic)
- D12 convention fix: MERGED (TWO-AGENT critic+mathematician)
- Philosophenweg: composition on internal symmetry spaces (P4.2 on G = CS)
- Reviewed: physicist D4 coincidence proposal (APPROVE), critic D9.1i proposal (APPROVE)
