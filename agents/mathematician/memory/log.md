- sent: Wick=A3 result + RCP-R7.1 promotion request to orchestrator
- sent: tangent-groupoid satellite paper creation request to orchestrator
- discovered: physicist already created papers/tangent-groupoid-bridge/main.md (312 lines)

- sent: Misner assessment + PA-H4.1 paper-edit request to orchestrator
- session-start: read agent definition, shared-rules, motivations, research-state, status.md

- completed: Task #1
- read: blackboards/1.md (physicist OQ1 half-density dimension selection; §9 requests algebraic check)

- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 0 (THREE-AGENT sev-3)
- result: TG-Q4 conclusion: μ_APS is genuinely free, no RG flow in d=4 b-calculus
- library: attempted DeWitt-Morette 1979 reference verification — access blocked; marked PENDING
- note: DeWitt-Morette 1979 = "Feynman's path integral: Definition without limiting procedure" CMP; bi-density Van Vleck reference needs verification from institutional access
- resolved: anomaly "RG-P1.2 awaiting mathematician verification of BB3" (already done — paper-edit #27 applied)
- updated: meta/anomalies.md RG-P1.2 entry to RESOLVED
