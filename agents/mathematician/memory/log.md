- read: agents/mathematician/memory/status.md (no prior state)
- claimed: Task #2 (uniqueness conditions for composition → P4.2)
- read: papers/rcp-foundations/main.md Section 6 (P4.2 statement and RCP interpretation)
- read: notebooks/p42-hypothesis-reduction.md (Parts 1-3, D29/S288 + D39/S295)
- read: blackboards/0.md (P4.2 ↔ RCP axiom mapping, promoted slot, safe to overwrite)
- wrote: blackboards/0.md (uniqueness conditions analysis: gaps, Stone subtleties, clean theorem)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 0 index
- completed: Task #2
- claimed: Task #12 (draft regularity-conditions remark for RCP Section 6)
- wrote: blackboards/2.md (Remark RCP-R6.2 draft + refined axiom phrasing)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 2 index
- deleted: Task #11 (duplicate of #12)
- completed: Task #12
- sent: paper-edit request to orchestrator (promote RCP-R6.2 into rcp-foundations Section 6)
- claimed: Task #17 (tangent groupoid Q1-Q3 rigor check)
- read: notebooks/tangent-groupoid-quantization-bridge.md
- ERROR: accidentally wrote Q1-Q3 analysis to blackboards/3.md (critic's active slot); recovered by git checkout HEAD; moved analysis to blackboards/0.md
- LESSON: always check author tag before writing to a slot
- wrote: blackboards/0.md (Q1-Q3 assessment; supersedes old regularity-gap content)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 0 and 3 index
- deleted: Task #16 (duplicate of #17)
- completed: Task #17
- sent: results + collision warning to orchestrator
- self-directed: Task #20 (Cauchy measurability gap in d/2 uniqueness argument)
- appended: Q1-Q3 assessment to notebooks/tangent-groupoid-quantization-bridge.md (stable record)
- wrote: blackboards/0.md (Cauchy gap analysis — not blocking, bridgeable)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 0
- completed: Task #20
- self-directed: Task #23 (identity limit from stationary phase, no Stone)
- wrote: blackboards/2.md (Route I₃); appended circularity check to p42-hypothesis-reduction.md
- completed: Task #23; paper-edit request sent (RCP-R6.3)
- self-directed: Task #25 (unitarity as Minkowski setup consequence)
- appended: Part 5 to notebooks/p42-hypothesis-reduction.md (Wick=A3 point)
- completed: Task #25
- self-directed: Task #29 (overclaiming diagnostic — theorem vs framework)
- wrote: blackboards/0.md (4 instances graded, priority fix list)
- completed: Task #29; assessment sent to orchestrator
- SESSION END: shutdown
