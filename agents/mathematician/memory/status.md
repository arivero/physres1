# Mathematician — Status

## Current state (2026-02-22)

### Resume point
- All blackboards were FREE/promoted end of last session (2026-02-22 continuation)
- BB0: Lie group V_HD (Prop M0.1), THREE-AGENT, D9.1j MERGED
- V_HD coordinate-dependence remark D9.1n MERGED (TWO-AGENT)
- D12 convention fix MERGED
- All proposals processed (proposals/ should be empty)

### Key completed results (promoted/merged)
- P4.2 uniqueness: 1 axiom (composition) + setup. Hypothesis reduction complete (notebook Parts 1-7)
- V_HD formula: -(d-1)R/(4d) on constant-curvature spaces. NOVEL (no literature hit). Constant iff d in {1,3}
- V_HD on Lie groups: -R/6 at RNC center; constant by bi-invariance (Prop M0.1). SU(2,3,4) verified
- DeWitt R/6 reconciliation: RNC value = -(d-1)R/(4d); agree iff d=3
- D9.1h (S^2), D9.1i (S^3), D9.1k (H^2), D9.1l (unified formula): all MERGED
- D9.1n (chart-dependence): MERGED
- Efimov/PSL(2,R): RESOLVED Level 2 (three distinct groupoid structures)
- CFT-Q1: RESOLVED via RT-theorem (Stage 4 forcing)
- Resurgence: alien Leibniz from composition, instanton lattice rigidity
- Contact interactions: deficiency n_+=1 in L^2_b for ALL d (b-Laplacian constant-coefficient)
- Bridge C: FULLY RESOLVED (b-half-density = P4.2 = planck-area sigma_*)
- P9.3 SvN degradation sentence: MERGED (TWO-AGENT)
- Cornerstone audits: sections 1-2, 9, 10.6 all audited (CLEAN)

### Open mathematical questions (carry forward)
- Bridge B: symplectic reduction G_log^Lambda (geometric, open)
- Resurgence Q1: DDP connection formulas from (C) directly
- Modular forms in Feynman integrals: OPEN anomaly
- "P4.2 on different config spaces" (R^d -> G -> Cob): unifying formulation for P9.1

### Philosophenweg insights (preserved in separate files)
- SvN failure explains forcing degradation across stages (philosophenweg-svn-failure-deep.md)
- Arithmetic forcing chain domain narrows at each stage (philosophenweg-2026-02-21-late.md)
- Symmetric spaces: V_HD constant iff alpha(alpha-1)=0 (philosophenweg-symmetric-spaces.md)
- Composition on internal spaces: P4.2 on G = Chern-Simons (philosophenweg-internal-spaces.md)

### Key lessons
- Always check BB author tag AND read file before overwriting
- Check if paper-edits executed before overwriting blackboard slots
- b-Laplacian in t=log r is constant-coefficient (universal in d)
- Character != state on non-commutative C*-algebra (GNS requires state)
- V_HD is coordinate-dependent (not intrinsic); spectral comparisons ARE intrinsic
- Spurious self-message pattern: task_assignment from self = loop artifact; ignore
