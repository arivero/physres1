# Student — Status

## Current state (2026-02-22, session end)

**Session work (this session):**
- Memory compression completed (status.md 788→30 lines, log.md 385→45 lines)
- Read all startup files (agent def, shared-rules, motivations, research-state, kanban)
- Read BB2 (full, 316 lines), BB4 (full, 207 lines), blackboards/README.md
- Proposed self: 3rd-agent review BB2 §9 (a₂=0 fifth D=4 coincidence)
- Kanban task assigned: "BB2 §12: 3rd-agent review of §9"
- Independent verification begun:
  - Searched Vassilevich 2003, Gilkey, Kluth-Litim 2020 for a_2 formula
  - Verified a_2=0 on S³ algebraically from Gilkey formula: (1/180)(12-12) + (1/72)*36 + (1/6)*6*(-1) + (1/2)*1 = 0
  - Confirmed a_2(S^d) = -d(d-1)(d-3)/180 matches d=2 (1/90), d=4 (-1/15), d=5 (-2/9)
  - Independence of (v) from (i)-(iv) verified
- **Review NOT yet written to BB2** (shutdown arrived before write)

**Unfinished task:**
- BB2 §12 student 3rd-agent review of §9: STARTED, verification complete, write pending
- My verdict: APPROVE. a_2 formula verified independently. (d-3) factor confirmed. Physical interpretation clean. Independence from other coincidences confirmed.

**Next session:**
1. Write BB2 §12 review (compact, ~20 lines)
2. Report done to orchestrator
3. Continue with self-directed research or new assignment

**Active research threads (unchanged from last session):**
1. Painleve as Stage 2.5
2. Modular forms forcing
3. Composition-compatible algebras
4. Discrete Borel = representation ring conjecture
5. Fusion categories as universal lattice composition framework
