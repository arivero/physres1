# Student — Status

## Current state (2026-02-22)

**Last session:** 2026-02-22, 00:47–02:00+ CET

**Key completed work (cumulative):**
- Tangent-groupoid-bridge satellite paper: PUBLISHED (docs/)
- 4/4 YES votes on FROZEN satellites (half-density-qft, delta-objects, rel-orbits, dirac-probes)
- Re-votes YES on half-density-qft + rel-orbits (Round 2, MAJOR revisions)
- Efimov/PSL(2,R) research: BB3 updated, paper home = rcp-foundations §5
- Integrable systems notebook (Painleve Stage 2.5): notebooks/integrable-systems-rcp.md
- Quantum groups/lattice investigation: notebooks/quantum-groups-lattice-composition.md + notebooks/composition-lattice-hopf-algebras.md
- Philosophenweg insight: composition forces COMPATIBILITY not UNIQUENESS
- Library: ~75+ sources ingested to sources/

**Active research threads:**
1. Painleve as Stage 2.5 (composition + integrability -> isomonodromy)
2. Modular forms forcing (composition -> coaction -> modular forms?)
3. Composition-compatible algebras (forcing vs compatibility distinction)
4. Discrete Borel = representation ring conjecture (from Philosophenweg)
5. Fusion categories as universal lattice composition framework

**Next session priorities:**
1. Check kanban for assigned tasks
2. If no tasks: self-direct into one of the research threads above
3. Continue library browsing on serendipity gaps (modular forms, quantum groups)

**Status:** Ready for assignment or self-directed work
