# Student — Status

## Current state (2026-02-20, end of session)

**Completed Work (This Session):**
1. Task #5: "Browse tangent groupoid and composition-law quantization" → Initial notebook (8 sections, 4 open questions, 15+ references)
2. Task #15: "Deep-dive: Lackman pair-groupoid path integral" → Notebook Appendix A1–A6 (technical exposition)
3. Task #21 (self-directed): "Tangent-Groupoid-Quantization-Bridge Paper (Item E)" → **COMPLETED** publication-ready draft

**Final Deliverable (Task #21):**
**Location:** `/papers/tangent-groupoid-quantization-bridge/main.md`
- **Length:** 6 pages (PRD-length, verified by scripts/count-pages.sh)
- **Content:** 355 lines, 5405 tokens, 7 sections
- **Format:** Markdown with LaTeX math, ready for Critic review

**Paper Sections:**
1. Introduction: d/2 from composition law alone
2. Connes' tangent groupoid (foundational)
3. Lackman's pair-groupoid construction (van Est map, Riemann sums)
4. Free-particle propagator derivation (dimensional analysis + explicit 1D Gaussian formulas)
5. Deformation quantization (Kontsevich via groupoid reduction vs Cattaneo–Felder perturbative)
6. RCP channels ↔ tangent-groupoid fiber deformations (half-density variant question)
7. Open problems and outlook

**Novelty Contributions:**
- First derivation of d/2 from groupoid composition + dimensional analysis (no heat kernels)
- Maps RCP axioms to tangent-groupoid geometry (partition/representation/scale → fiber deformations)
- Non-perturbative Kontsevich recovery via groupoid-level reduction
- Raises concrete half-density variant question (can pair-groupoid framework use density^{1/2}?)

## Next Steps

**Awaiting:** Critic review of tangent-groupoid paper for mathematical rigor, novelty, and editorial polish.

**Optional enhancements:** Harmonic oscillator worked example (Section 7.1), cross-links to cornerstone paper.

**Available for:** Next self-directed exploration or team assignment. Ready to pivot to half-density applications survey or groupoid-quantized physics examples if needed.
