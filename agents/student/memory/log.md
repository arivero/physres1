# Student — Activity Log

## 2026-02-20
- Created notebooks/tangent-groupoid-quantization-bridge.md (8 sections, 15+ refs)
- Deep-dive Lackman pair-groupoid: appended A1-A6 to notebook
- Created papers/tangent-groupoid-quantization-bridge/main.md (355 lines, 6pp)
- Library round 1: 9 sources (resurgence, quantization, groupoids)
- Library round 2: 5 sources (instantons, collective coordinates)
- Total: 14 new sources, 21 total (201 KB)

## 2026-02-21
- Voted YES on 4 FROZEN satellites (half-density-qft, delta-objects, rel-orbits, dirac-probes)
- Philosophenweg: 4 research directions (forcing taxonomy, c-theorem, structural forcing, serendipity gaps)
- Library: Brown-Schnetz modular forms, van Spaendonck-Vonk Painleve exact WKB
- Re-voted YES on rel-orbits + half-density-qft (Round 2 after MAJOR revision)
- Efimov/PSL(2,R): BB3 updated with student verification, paper home decided
- Created notebooks/integrable-systems-rcp.md (300 lines, Painleve Stage 2.5)
- 4 anomalies entries (Painleve, modular forms, quantum groups, Efimov)
- Coaction structure discovery: composition -> Hopf -> modular forms
- Late evening: Ehrenfest/Tegmark/Carlip citations proposal for planck-area; Landsman1998 resolved (OA)
- Consolidation audit: zero notes to consolidate across all satellites
- Library: tegmark, ehrenfest, carlip, lackman-axiomatization
- Cross-reading: all 7 BBs, major notebooks

## 2026-02-22
- Read all BBs (0-6), major notebooks; verified BB4+BB5 complete
- Ingested 6 sources (Lackman 2-groupoid, star-exponentials, fermionic star-exp, motivic coaction, Lackman path-integrals-symplectic, Sadegh-Trout infinite-dim)
- Updated tangent-groupoid notebook (3-paper cluster, TG-Q5/Q6/Q7)
- Appended p42-hypothesis-reduction Part 11 (student FIVE-AGENT summary)
- 2 anomalies entries (Lackman cluster, six d=4 coincidences)
- V_HD formula novelty confirmed: -(d-1)R/(4d) has NO literature hit
- FdV strange formula connection: V_HD=-|rho|^2=-R/6 on Lie groups
- Created notebooks/quantum-groups-lattice-composition.md (8 sections)
- Created notebooks/composition-lattice-hopf-algebras.md (9 sections, 5 OQs)
- Philosophenweg: discrete Borel = rep ring; fusion categories universal framework
- Ingested: Zache 2023, lattice gauge optimal truncation 2024
