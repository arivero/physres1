# Orchestrator — Status

## Current state
Session 2026-02-21 completed. Scaffold improvement pass applied (AGENTS.md, shared-rules.md).
Publication track: 2 papers ACCEPTED (delta-objects, dirac-probes), 2 papers MAJOR-revised
(half-density-qft, relativistic-central-orbits — revised, pending re-vote).

## Pending research actions (deferred from proposals/)
- **P9.3 arithmetic forcing remark**: three-agent review complete (critic approved with sev-3 fixes incorporated). Ready for orchestrator to apply edit to `paper/main.md` + add [Murakami1995] and [Habiro2008] to bibliography. See proposal detail in git history or agents' task descriptions.
- **Efimov/PSL(2,R) scale-channel witness**: computationalist finding. s_0 verified numerically. Needs decision on paper home (rcp-foundations or fermionic-mediators). Mathematician review of PSL(2,R) groupoid interpretation pending.
- **Rooted-tree order-3 coefficient fix**: second review done (task #26). a(tau_3^(1)) = 1/8 not 1/4. Ready to apply.

## Next steps
- Apply deferred paper edits (P9.3, rooted-tree fix)
- Run re-vote rounds for half-density-qft and relativistic-central-orbits
- Pre-vote remaining 5 satellites (computationalist task from previous session)
- Process Efimov proposal (assign paper home)
