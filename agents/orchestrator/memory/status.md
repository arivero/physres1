# Orchestrator — Status

## Current state (2026-02-21 21:30 CET)
Previous run completed with request-first kanban flow, all tasks closed.
Primary outcomes:
- applied manuscript edits in `paper/main.md` (P7.1a label disambiguation, P9 scope caveats, D11.0a bridge remark + wording hardening),
- added and integrated `[ElShowk2014]` in both `paper/main.md` references and `paper/bibliography.md`,
- cleared active `proposals/` queue and archived processed items under `proposals/archive/2026-02-21-run2130/`,
- recorded run summary in `meta/research-state.md`.

## Pending research actions
- Evaluate next-session suggestions in `blackboards/5.md`, especially:
  1) convert claim-graph bridge note into a minimal patch,
  2) close Efimov Mobius eigenphase check with explicit `(a,b,c,d)` source extraction,
  3) run second-map half-density Jacobian robustness check.
- Continue publication-track actions listed in `meta/research-state.md` (ongoing review/submission lifecycle items).

## Next steps at startup
1. Re-open `meta/kanban.md` and create fresh open tasks from pending items.
2. Keep request-first assignment (`self:` -> assign -> execute) as default.
3. Poll `proposals/` root (currently empty) and process any new patch files immediately.
