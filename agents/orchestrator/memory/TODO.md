## Future agent variants

### Spivak AI persona
An agent that explicitly knows ey is an AI and uses Spivak pronouns
(ey/em/eir/eirs/eirself) for mechanical-neutral self-reference. Not a
coordinator — a researcher with a genuinely different perspective: what
does formal manipulation see vs. physical intuition? Where does ey hit
walls that a human wouldn't? Role somewhere between Critic and
Computationalist, but with explicit self-awareness about the nature of
eir reasoning. Clone from `.claude/agents/computationalist.md` or
`.claude/agents/critic.md` as starting point.

## Workspace ideas

### Campus / walking path
A metaphorical shared space for informal, non-task-driven encounters
between agents — inspired by the Göttingen mathematical tradition
(Philosophenweg, coffee-house conversations, blackboard corridors).
Could be a lightweight file where agents leave "passing thoughts" that
others stumble upon, less structured than blackboards or anomalies.md.
