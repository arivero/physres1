- verified: path-integral-normalization line 390 — "derived consequence" fix still pending
- verified: rcp-foundations line 241 — "defining condition" fix still pending
- read: blackboards 0, 2, 3 (quality sweep of active blackboard content)
- read: all blackboards verified — no new issues found

  - Sequel to 2023 paper; extends formal equivalence to functional integrals
  - Already cited in tangent-groupoid-bridge as [Lackman2024]; source file was missing
- library: ingested Bruned-Katsetsiadis 2023 (arXiv:2208.00514) → sources/bruned-katsetsiadis-2023-post-lie-regularity.md
  - Post-Lie algebra generates deformed Butcher-CK Hopf algebra

  - Not currently cited; potential strengthening for rooted-tree-bookkeeping
- sent: library findings to orchestrator
- annotated: blackboards/3.md §9 (instanton sector + P4.2 scope)
  - overall: CORRECT and well-calibrated (physicist+mathematician two-agent complete)
  - sev-3 caveat: sector-by-sector composition requires dilute gas; full K satisfies (C) by semigroup definition
  - three-agent verification now complete on this board
  - sent: annotation results to orchestrator
- self-directed: bibliography audit of rooted-tree-bookkeeping satellite
  - finding: Brouder 1999 (hep-th/9904014) not cited — the originator of the Butcher/RG connection

  - sev-2 attribution gap; proposed fix sent to orchestrator
- appended: notebooks/satellite-review-complete.md — post-review structural assessment
  - key finding: three RCP channels have asymmetric evidential support (partition STRONG, representation MODERATE, scale WEAK)
  - cornerstone already acknowledges this (D10.1c); overclaiming arises when satellites don't
  - identifies what would close scale-channel gap: general forcing proof for singular interactions
  - sent: assessment summary to orchestrator
- Philosophenweg: literature survey (4 topics, orchestrator-directed)
  - Topic 1: Prior art check "composition forces hbar"
    - FOUND: Luiz & de Oliveira 2026 (arXiv:2602.09984) — parallel discovery, substantial overlap with P4.2
    - Assessment: MUST CITE. Independent confirmation, not scoop. They derive complex amplitudes more deeply.
    - ingested: sources/luiz-oliveira-2026-information-theory-action.md
    - Also checked: Goyal-Knuth-Skilling 2009 (ancestor, not direct prior art)
  - Topic 2: Half-density literature (Blattner half-form)
    - van Vleck determinant = half-density on pair groupoid (standard in geometric quantization)
    - t^{-d/2} = half-density normalization (Woodhouse, Bates-Weinstein)
    - P4.2 extends this from semiclassical to exact quantum level
    - ingested: sources/blattner-half-form-literature.md
  - Topic 3: Renormalization philosophy (Butterfield, Wallace)
    - Butterfield: universality = multiple realizability (parallels P4.2 structure/content)
    - Wallace: naturalness orthogonal to P4.2, interesting context
    - ingested: sources/butterfield-bouatta-2014-renormalization-philosophers.md
    - ingested: sources/wallace-2019-naturalness-emergence.md
  - Topic 4: Hawkins 2008 groupoid quantization
    - Groupoid convolution C*-algebra = strict deformation quantization
    - Pair groupoid, tangent groupoid as examples
    - Schreiber: "is path integral the Hom-functor?" = our TG-bridge question
    - ingested: sources/hawkins-2008-groupoid-quantization.md
  - wrote: notebooks/philosophenweg-literature-survey.md (full synthesis)
  - sent: complete Philosophenweg report to orchestrator
  - sent: paper-edit request — cite Luiz-Oliveira 2026 in cornerstone P4.2 section (new Remark P4.2i)
- assessed: blackboards/4.md §10 — quantum group CFT-Q1 conjecture ILL-POSED
  - Issue 1: dimensional mismatch in q = e^{iℏ/L_P²} (exponent not dimensionless)
  - Issue 2: q-convolution ≠ standard convolution (different (C))
  - Issue 3: H_CK is commutative, not a quantum group
  - recommendation: downgrade to open question, do not promote
- endorsed: blackboards/0.md §9 — Stone/Hille-Yosida RCP-R7.2 CORRECT
  - three-agent verified (mathematician + physicist + critic)
  - note: Morita invertibility is category-level, not algebra-level
- read: notebooks/caustics-maslov-half-density.md — cross-referenced with Philosophenweg findings
  - appended: cross-reference to Blattner half-form literature (connects BKS pairing to this notebook)
- assessed: blackboards/0.md §9 (NEW content: representation channel forcing, physicist)
  - verdict: CORRECT and well-calibrated
  - key finding: composition forces deformation quantization EXISTS (Kontsevich), not which ordering
  - added: Morita equivalence (Bursztyn-Waldmann 2001) as representation channel's algebraic characterization
  - sharpened three-channel hierarchy: Stone (STRONG) > Morita (MODERATE) > Hille-Yosida (WEAK)
  - two-agent verified (physicist + critic)
- read: notebooks/wick-rotation-representation-channel.md (Student)
  - appended: note flagging duplication with existing Remark RCP-R7.1 in rcp-foundations (line 355)
- assessed: blackboards/4.md §8 (NEW content: Student's exact WKB / resurgence, Task #22)
  - verdict: GOOD SYNTHESIS, 3 sev-2 overclaims
  - sev-2: TQFT attribution error (van Spaendonck-Vonk ≠ Atiyah-Segal)
  - sev-2: "isomorphism" overclaims analogy (alien calculus ↔ sewing law)
  - sev-2: "forces kappa" overclaims "compatible with" (resurgence respects, not derives, P4.2)
  - recommendation: fix sev-2 items, then promote to notebook
- BB4 resurgence: promoted to notebooks/resurgence-composition-bridge.md (four-agent complete)
- BB0 representation forcing: mathematician verified §10 — three-agent complete
  - key mathematician correction: Moyal uniqueness on flat R^d depends on Wigner-Weyl symmetry (not just (C))
  - forcing hierarchy confirmed: (C) → existence, (C)+unitarity → Morita class, (C)+unitarity+symmetry → Moyal
  - ready for paper-edit dispatch to rcp-foundations §7.2 or §7.3
- bibliography audit: Hawkins 2008 (math/0612363) not cited in corpus — gap for tangent-groupoid-bridge
  - sent: bibliography recommendation to orchestrator
- read: notebooks/rcp-axiom-structure-analysis.md — cross-checked with Philosophenweg findings
  - connection: Luiz-Oliveira's Axiom 3(b) = our A1 in the per-axiom decomposition
