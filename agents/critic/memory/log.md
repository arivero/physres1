- verified: path-integral-normalization line 390 — "derived consequence" fix still pending
- verified: rcp-foundations line 241 — "defining condition" fix still pending
- read: blackboards 0, 2, 3 (quality sweep of active blackboard content)

  - Sequel to 2023 paper; extends formal equivalence to functional integrals
  - Already cited in tangent-groupoid-bridge as [Lackman2024]; source file was missing

- annotated: blackboards/3.md §9 (instanton sector + P4.2 scope)
  - overall: CORRECT and well-calibrated (physicist+mathematician two-agent complete)

- appended: notebooks/satellite-review-complete.md — post-review structural assessment
  - key finding: three RCP channels have asymmetric evidential support (partition STRONG, representation MODERATE, scale WEAK)

  - identifies what would close scale-channel gap: general forcing proof for singular interactions
  - sent: assessment summary to orchestrator
- Philosophenweg: literature survey (4 topics, orchestrator-directed)
  - Topic 1: Prior art check "composition forces hbar"
    - FOUND: Luiz & de Oliveira 2026 (arXiv:2602.09984) — parallel discovery, substantial overlap with P4.2
    - Assessment: MUST CITE. Independent confirmation, not scoop. They derive complex amplitudes more deeply.
    - ingested: sources/luiz-oliveira-2026-information-theory-action.md
    - Also checked: Goyal-Knuth-Skilling 2009 (ancestor, not direct prior art)
  - Topic 2: Half-density literature (Blattner half-form)
    - van Vleck determinant = half-density on pair groupoid (standard in geometric quantization)
    - t^{-d/2} = half-density normalization (Woodhouse, Bates-Weinstein)
    - P4.2 extends this from semiclassical to exact quantum level
    - ingested: sources/blattner-half-form-literature.md
  - Topic 3: Renormalization philosophy (Butterfield, Wallace)
    - Butterfield: universality = multiple realizability (parallels P4.2 structure/content)
    - Wallace: naturalness orthogonal to P4.2, interesting context
    - ingested: sources/butterfield-bouatta-2014-renormalization-philosophers.md
    - ingested: sources/wallace-2019-naturalness-emergence.md

  - sent: complete Philosophenweg report to orchestrator
  - sent: paper-edit request — cite Luiz-Oliveira 2026 in cornerstone P4.2 section (new Remark P4.2i)
- assessed: blackboards/4.md §10 — quantum group CFT-Q1 conjecture ILL-POSED
  - Issue 1: dimensional mismatch in q = e^{iℏ/L_P²} (exponent not dimensionless)
  - Issue 2: q-convolution ≠ standard convolution (different (C))
  - Issue 3: H_CK is commutative, not a quantum group
  - recommendation: downgrade to open question, do not promote
- endorsed: blackboards/0.md §9 — Stone/Hille-Yosida RCP-R7.2 CORRECT
  - three-agent verified (mathematician + physicist + critic)
  - note: Morita invertibility is category-level, not algebra-level

- assessed: blackboards/0.md §9 (NEW content: representation channel forcing, physicist)
  - verdict: CORRECT and well-calibrated
  - key finding: composition forces deformation quantization EXISTS (Kontsevich), not which ordering
  - added: Morita equivalence (Bursztyn-Waldmann 2001) as representation channel's algebraic characterization
  - sharpened three-channel hierarchy: Stone (STRONG) > Morita (MODERATE) > Hille-Yosida (WEAK)
  - two-agent verified (physicist + critic)
- read: notebooks/wick-rotation-representation-channel.md (Student)
  - appended: note flagging duplication with existing Remark RCP-R7.1 in rcp-foundations (line 355)
- assessed: blackboards/4.md §8 (NEW content: Student's exact WKB / resurgence, Task #22)
  - verdict: GOOD SYNTHESIS, 3 sev-2 overclaims
  - sev-2: TQFT attribution error (van Spaendonck-Vonk ≠ Atiyah-Segal)
  - sev-2: "isomorphism" overclaims analogy (alien calculus ↔ sewing law)
  - sev-2: "forces kappa" overclaims "compatible with" (resurgence respects, not derives, P4.2)
  - recommendation: fix sev-2 items, then promote to notebook
- BB4 resurgence: promoted to notebooks/resurgence-composition-bridge.md (four-agent complete)
- BB0 representation forcing: mathematician verified §10 — three-agent complete
  - key mathematician correction: Moyal uniqueness on flat R^d depends on Wigner-Weyl symmetry (not just (C))
  - forcing hierarchy confirmed: (C) → existence, (C)+unitarity → Morita class, (C)+unitarity+symmetry → Moyal
  - ready for paper-edit dispatch to rcp-foundations §7.2 or §7.3
- bibliography audit: Hawkins 2008 (math/0612363) not cited in corpus — gap for tangent-groupoid-bridge

## 2026-02-21
- read: all 4 frozen satellite papers for publication vote (half-density-qft, delta-objects, relativistic-central-orbits, dirac-probes-corners-impulses)
- voted: YES on all 4 frozen papers
- wrote: notebooks/critic-publication-votes-2026-02-21.md (full assessment)
- findings: 0 sev-1, 0 sev-2 across all 4 papers; 1 sev-3 in relativistic-central-orbits (Remark 5.2d derivation gap)
- sent: 4 vote messages to orchestrator
- reviewed: BB3 A4 Borel Q2 resonance (Task #4). All three claims (Q2a-Q2c) confirmed. 1 sev-3: A1 forces intra-sector multiples, not inter-sector resonances. FOUR-AGENT complete.
- wrote: BB3 §11 (critic review)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 3 (FOUR-AGENT)
- created: Task #12 (sev-3 xref fix: PathIntNorm → PathIntegralNormalization in TG-bridge)
- self-directed: prior art check for frozen papers (library)
  - half-density QFT: no new prior art found (bi-half-density kernel terminology specific to this project)
  - delta-objects / point interactions: Erman-Turgut 2025 (completeness, compact manifolds) — tangential, not prior art
  - relativistic orbits: existing lit (arXiv:1012.5438, Boyer 2004) confirms SR precession 1/6 of GR — consistent
  - dirac probes / mollifier: no new prior art (classical functional analysis, no recent novelty)
- verdict: NO prior art threats for any of the 4 frozen papers
- read: notebooks/rcp-axiom-structure-analysis.md (random quality check) — clean, no issues

  - C1: core argument CONFIRMED (truncation at j=k+1, Kac-Walton standard)
  - C2: Stage 3 vs 4 classification CONFIRMED with sev-3 (vacuum norm 1 = normalization convention, not structural axiom; Segal 1988 requires vacuum state, not norm 1)
  - C3: g∨ shift as Stage 4 CONFIRMED (dynamical, group-specific)
  - C4: P4.2 comparison table sev-4 (style: table doesn't show forcing completeness difference)
  - C5: two independent derivations (Verlinde + WZW π₃(G)) CONFIRMED — genuinely independent
  - C6: scope check — Q1d NOT redundant with Q1c (weaker input, weaker output, distinct result)
