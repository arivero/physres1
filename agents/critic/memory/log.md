- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 5 index
- sent: severity-ranked review to orchestrator (Task #18)
- finding: "Weyl ordering" in PDM example is actually left-right symmetric, not true Weyl

- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 5 index
- sent: severity-ranked review to orchestrator (Task #19, self-directed)
- finding: Noether witness (Section 3) adds no new content beyond standard result
- finding: axiom A2 redundant (derivable from A1 per P4.2h), kept in axiom list without justification
- wrote: notebooks/cross-paper-overclaiming-diagnostic.md (Task #22, self-directed)
- finding: systematic overclaiming pattern across all 4 reviewed items — math sound, framing overclaims
- sent: cross-paper diagnostic to orchestrator (Task #22)
- read: papers/rg-fundamental/main.md (full, 724 lines)
- wrote: blackboards/5.md (critique of rg-fundamental satellite, overwrote student Lackman derivation)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 5 index
- sent: severity-ranked review to orchestrator (Task #24, self-directed)
- finding: "RG is definitional" (RG-H1.17) overclaims — analogy not derivation
- finding: two-layer QFT (RG-H1.18) logical independence stated without proof
- finding: Noether crown witness (RG-H1.16) repeats rcp-foundations error
- finding: 2D delta material (Sections 5.1-5.9) is sound and well-done
- finding: all algebra checked (loop integrals, beta function, shell integration, dimensional analysis, Robin scaling) — correct
- read: papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md (full, 431 lines)
- wrote: blackboards/5.md (critique of rooted-tree-bookkeeping satellite, overwrote rg-fundamental review)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 5 index
- sent: severity-ranked review to orchestrator (Task #27, self-directed)
- finding: ERRORS — elementary differential for chain tree [[\bullet]] is wrong (line 174)
- finding: ERRORS — midpoint B-series coefficients at order 3 swapped AND wrong values (lines 180-181)
- finding: ERRORS — coproduct for branch tree [\bullet,\bullet] has wrong tensor structure (line 379)
- finding: order-3 coefficient error also present in rg-fundamental Section 3.5 (cross-paper bug)
- finding: paper's framing is well-done — honest "non-goal" disclaimer avoids overclaiming pattern
- read: papers/planck-area/main.md (full, 736 lines)
- wrote: blackboards/5.md (critique of planck-area satellite, overwrote rooted-tree-bookkeeping review)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 5 index
- sent: severity-ranked review to orchestrator (Task #30, self-directed)
- finding: no mathematical errors found — all algebra checks pass
- finding: hypothesis ladder (PA-H2.x) is exemplary methodological practice
- finding: overclaiming pattern ABSENT — careful "under these hypotheses" framing throughout
- finding: areal-speed section (240 lines, 13 sub-remarks) is tangential and oversized
- finding: conformal filter PA-H2.6a and heat-kernel witness PA-H2.6c are genuine independent $D=4$ results

- wrote: blackboards/5.md (critique of half-density-qft satellite, overwrote planck-area review)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 5 index
- sent: severity-ranked review to orchestrator (Task #31, self-directed)
- finding: no errors found — cleanest short paper in the project
- finding: HD-D1.3a correctly distinguishes half-density conjugation from conformal coupling
- finding: counterterm scaling hierarchy (HD-D5.3-D5.3b) is well-organized
- finding: overclaiming pattern absent — paper is "intentionally narrow" and delivers precisely

- wrote: blackboards/5.md (critique of delta-objects satellite)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 5 index
