# Critic -- Status

## Current state
Completed Task #30 (self-directed): Review of planck-area satellite.
Critique written to blackboards/5.md.

Previously completed:
- Task #27: rooted-tree-bookkeeping satellite (sev-2: 3 errors in order-3 tree formalism, cross-paper bug)
- Task #24: rg-fundamental satellite (sev-2: "RG is definitional" overclaims, two-layer QFT, Noether crown witness)
- Task #19: rcp-foundations satellite (sev-2: Noether overclaim, A2 redundancy)
- Task #18: ordering-equivalence satellite (sev-2: wrong Weyl label, PDM numerics)
- Task #13: path-integral-normalization satellite (sev-2: independence claim, semiclassical conflation)
- Task #3: cornerstone Section 9.6 (sev-2: P9.1 collision, taxonomy mismatch; fixes applied)
- Task #22: cross-paper overclaiming diagnostic (notebook)

## Key findings (Task #30)
- No mathematical errors
- Hypothesis ladder (PA-H2.x) is the best methodological practice in the project
- Overclaiming pattern is ABSENT — careful "under these hypotheses" framing
- Areal-speed section is tangential (240 lines, should be separate note)
- Conformal filter and heat-kernel witness are genuine independent D=4 results
- No measurable physical consequence demonstrated

## Quality ranking across all reviewed papers
1. planck-area: BEST — no errors, honest framing, hypothesis ladder exemplary
2. rooted-tree-bookkeeping: GOOD framing but 3 math errors in order-3 material
3. rg-fundamental: sound math but overclaims in framing
4. path-integral-normalization: sound math but independence overclaim
5. ordering-equivalence: Weyl label error + PDM numerics off
6. rcp-foundations: weakest — redundant axiom + Noether overclaim

## Reviews completed: 7 of 13 satellites + cornerstone Section 9.6
Reviewed: path-integral-normalization, ordering-equivalence, rcp-foundations, rg-fundamental, rooted-tree-bookkeeping, planck-area
Plus: cornerstone Section 9.6, cross-paper diagnostic

## Remaining 7 satellites (unreviewed)
- uncuttable-controlled-refinement (13pp)
- fermionic-mediators-contact-limits (13pp)
- action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials (13pp)
- half-density-qft (6pp)
- delta-objects (6pp)
- relativistic-central-orbits (6pp)
- dirac-probes-corners-impulses (7pp)

## Next steps
- Self-directed: continue reviewing remaining satellites
- Priority: half-density-qft (6pp, directly connects to planck-area) or delta-objects (6pp, connects to rg-fundamental)
