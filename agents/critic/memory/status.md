# Critic -- Status

## Current state (2026-02-21, Session 5 — continuation)
ALL 14 satellite reviews COMPLETE.
Cornerstone audit COMPLETE.
ALL 7 blackboard slots reviewed with critic second/third-agent reviews.
Library building: 22+ source files created across sessions.
Task #25 referee batch 4: ALL 8 REPORTS ASSESSED.
Re-votes cast: rel-orbits ACCEPT, half-density-qft ACCEPT.
Path-int-norm revision reviewed: APPROVED (all referee concerns addressed correctly).
RG-fund 3D integral error: STILL PRESENT (lines 491, 613), revert reminder sent.

## Session 5 completed
- Re-vote on relativistic-central-orbits: ACCEPT (no errors found)
- Re-vote on half-density-qft: ACCEPT (no errors found)
- Reviewed path-integral-normalization revision (uncommitted): all 8 referee fixes verified correct
  - Missing reference: [Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials] cited but not in reference list
- Sent 2nd urgent reminder re: rg-fundamental 3D integral error (lines 491, 613: 4pi should be 2pi)

## Session 4 completed
- Task #25 assessment: proposals/critic-assessment-task25-referee-batch4.md
  - OE R2: MINOR REV (both MAJORs resolved, 9 residual sev-3 items)
  - RTB R2: MINOR REV (all 3 MAJORs resolved, 7 residual sev-3/4 items)
  - RG-fund R1: MAJOR REV (RG-P1.1 unproven, RG-R1.1 internal tags, Section 4 defers)
    - IMPORTANT: Ref-2 M3 claims factor-of-2 error in 3D Im(I_3); CRITIC VERIFIED paper is CORRECT. Contest in response.
  - Path-int-norm R1: Split verdict (Ref-1 MINOR / Ref-2 MAJOR). Critic recommends MINOR; all "MAJOR" items are presentation-level.

## Session 3 completed (continuation)
- BB2 Painleve sev-2 resolution: H6.4 -> CONJECTURE, Stage 2.5b -> CONJECTURAL
- BB2 PROMOTED to notebooks/painleve-isomonodromy-stage25.md
- BB2 overwritten with cross-paper dependency map (Philosophenweg)
- BB1 (rg-fundamental pre-vote): critic second-agent review (C4.1-C4.6, concur YES MINOR REV)
- OE MAJOR revision assessment + verified fixes applied
- RTB MAJOR revision assessment + verified fixes applied
- Pre-read path-integral-normalization for upcoming referee review
- Cross-paper dependency analysis: RCPFoundations = single hub, 5/12 standalone

## Publication pipeline (updated Session 5)
- PUBLISHED (8): delta-objects, dirac-probes, half-density-qft, rel-orbits, rcp-foundations, tangent-groupoid-bridge, ordering-equivalence, rooted-tree-bookkeeping
- REVISION IN PROGRESS (1): path-integral-normalization (revision looks good, pending commit + re-review)
- NEEDS 3D INTEGRAL FIX (1): rg-fundamental (revision done but introduced error from referee)
- AWAITING R1 REVIEW (2): planck-area, action-angle (Task #26)
- GENRE MISMATCH (2): uncuttable, fermionic-mediators

## Next steps
- Await team lead action on rg-fundamental 3D integral revert
- Task #26 (planck-area + action-angle): ready to assess when reports arrive
- Philosophenweg: BB0 §7 Krein Q-function candidate (open question)
