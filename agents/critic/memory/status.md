# Critic -- Status

## Current state
Completed Task #33 (self-directed): Review of relativistic-central-orbits satellite.
Critique written to blackboards/5.md.

Previously completed:
- Task #32: delta-objects satellite (no errors, clean dictionary paper)
- Task #31: half-density-qft satellite (no errors, cleanest short paper)
- Task #30: planck-area satellite (no errors, hypothesis ladder exemplary)
- Task #27: rooted-tree-bookkeeping satellite (sev-2: 3 errors in order-3 tree formalism, cross-paper bug)
- Task #24: rg-fundamental satellite (sev-2: "RG is definitional" overclaims, two-layer QFT, Noether crown witness)
- Task #19: rcp-foundations satellite (sev-2: Noether overclaim, A2 redundancy)
- Task #18: ordering-equivalence satellite (sev-2: wrong Weyl label, PDM numerics)
- Task #13: path-integral-normalization satellite (sev-2: independence claim, semiclassical conflation)
- Task #3: cornerstone Section 9.6 (sev-2: P9.1 collision, taxonomy mismatch; fixes applied)
- Task #22: cross-paper overclaiming diagnostic (notebook)

## Key findings (Task #33)
- No mathematical errors — all 17 algebra checks pass
- q_crit = nu + 1 scaling rule is the most original contribution
- Stability-precession duality (gamma^2 omega^2 = 1) is a nice structural point
- "Refinement witness" framing is thin — paper is standard SR/GR orbit mechanics
- Overclaiming pattern absent — honest disclaimer in abstract

## Quality ranking across all reviewed papers
1. planck-area: BEST — no errors, honest framing, hypothesis ladder exemplary
2. half-density-qft: no errors, cleanest short paper, intentionally narrow
3. delta-objects: no errors, clean dictionary, cautious framing
4. relativistic-central-orbits: no errors, standard material, thin refinement framing
5. rooted-tree-bookkeeping: GOOD framing but 3 math errors in order-3 material
6. rg-fundamental: sound math but overclaims in framing
7. path-integral-normalization: sound math but independence overclaim
8. ordering-equivalence: Weyl label error + PDM numerics off
9. rcp-foundations: weakest — redundant axiom + Noether overclaim

## Reviews completed: 10 of 13 satellites + cornerstone Section 9.6
Reviewed: path-integral-normalization, ordering-equivalence, rcp-foundations, rg-fundamental, rooted-tree-bookkeeping, planck-area, half-density-qft, delta-objects, relativistic-central-orbits
Plus: cornerstone Section 9.6, cross-paper diagnostic

## Remaining 4 satellites (unreviewed)
- dirac-probes-corners-impulses (7pp)
- uncuttable-controlled-refinement (13pp)
- fermionic-mediators-contact-limits (13pp)
- action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials (13pp)

## Next steps
- Self-directed: continue reviewing remaining satellites
- Priority: dirac-probes-corners-impulses (7pp, short) or one of the 13pp papers
