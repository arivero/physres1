# Critic -- Status

## Current state
ALL 14 satellite reviews COMPLETE.
Cornerstone audit COMPLETE.
ALL 7 blackboard slots reviewed. All three-agent or higher complete.
Library building: 18 source files created (total ~52 in sources/).

## Session 3 work
- Task #3 (arithmetic of Feynman integrals): COMPLETE
  - BB2: critical assessment. CK Hopf = our rooted-tree (identity). RG ↪ cosmic Galois. Coaction ≠ composition.
  - Verdict: 1 footnote rg-fundamental, 1 notebook entry, NO satellite.
- Task #9 (OQ4-H6 soft-limit universality): COMPLETE
  - 4 sev-2 overclaims in student's §10: soft ≠ refinement, inverse soft ≠ composition
  - BCFW factorization IS tree-level analog of (C); soft limits are NOT
  - Verdict: do NOT promote OQ4-H6. Deprecate §10, keep §9 (BCFW).
- BB0 (TG-P2.1 + TG-Q4): THREE-AGENT complete (§12 added: endorsed, sev-3)
