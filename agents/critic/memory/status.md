# Critic -- Status

## Current state (2026-02-22, Session 13 startup)

### Publication pipeline
- PUBLISHED (14): all satellites in docs/
- DISCARDED (3): fermionic-mediators, uncuttable (3/5 votes each), areal-speed (3-agent)
- Cornerstone: paper/main.md (~2000 lines, 35 refs, Physics Reports target)

### Vulnerability status
- Vuln 1 (path-space): SUBSTANTIALLY CLOSED (Appendix 10.6)
- Vuln 2 (ordering/domain): SUBSTANTIALLY ADDRESSED (S²+S³+H² witnesses, D9.1l unified formula)
- Vuln 3 (Appendix 10.1): CLOSED (D8.2a)
- Vuln 4 (truncation): CLOSED (D6.4a λφ⁴)

### Audit coverage
- Full cornerstone audited: §§1-10 all TWO-AGENT or higher
- All 7 blackboard slots multi-agent verified
- All 14 satellite reviews COMPLETE
- Session 12: D12 convention fix (SEV-2), full paper quality audit (2003 lines), D9.1n chart-dependence remark
- Session 11: composition-law QM literature landscape (BB3 TWO-AGENT), prior-art adequate
- Session 10: D6.5/D6.4b/D6.6 quality sweep CLEAN, BB0 TWO-AGENT, 100% multi-agent milestone

### Key unresolved
- RG-fundamental 3D integral: critic maintains 2pi correct, paper has 4pi (published as-is)
- V_HD formula -(d-1)R/(4d): NOVEL (no literature hit), flag for submission cover letter

### Next priorities
- Check for new tasks/assignments from orchestrator
- Continue cornerstone quality work if needed
