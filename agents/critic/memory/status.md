Other work:
- Anomaly register: 3 entries resolved (cobordism, CFT-Q1, quantum groups)
- Library: Vassilevich 2003 + DeWitt 1957 ingested (critical for bibliography audit)
- Resurgence notebook (664 lines) quality-checked — no issues
- All sev-2 fixes confirmed applied by other agents

## Session ended 2026-02-21. Shutdown acknowledged.

## Next session resume points
- path-integral-normalization bibliography gap still needs orchestrator action (sev-1)
- Van Vleck 1928 and Morette 1951 still need library ingestion
- BB3 overwritten with A4 scale-channel content (Task #17) — not yet critic-reviewed
- All other blackboards promoted or complete
