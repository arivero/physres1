# Critic -- Status

## Current state
Completed Task #24 (self-directed): Review of rg-fundamental satellite.
Critique written to blackboards/5.md.

Previously completed:
- Task #19: rcp-foundations satellite (sev-2: Noether overclaim, A2 redundancy)
- Task #18: ordering-equivalence satellite (sev-2: wrong Weyl label, PDM numerics)
- Task #13: path-integral-normalization satellite (sev-2: independence claim, semiclassical conflation)
- Task #3: cornerstone Section 9.6 (sev-2: P9.1 collision, taxonomy mismatch; fixes applied)
- Task #22: cross-paper overclaiming diagnostic (notebook)

## Key findings (Task #24)
- No fatal errors
- 3 severity-2: "RG is definitional" overclaims, two-layer QFT independence unproved, Noether crown witness repeats rcp-foundations error
- 4 severity-3: Hopf content descriptive only, self-citation noted, Gaussian coarse-graining is textbook, Robin derivation elementary
- 2 severity-4: label proliferation, length vs content ratio
- All algebra verified correct (loop integrals, beta function, shell integration, Robin scaling)

## Recurring pattern across all 5 reviews
Papers tend to overclaim: presenting one argument in multiple guises as "independent,"
or claiming RCP "forces" things that follow from pre-existing mathematics.
The strongest content is always the explicit calculations (P4.2, d/2 forcing, 2D delta RG).
The weakest content is always the interpretive framing.
The Noether crown-witness overclaim now appears in both rcp-foundations and rg-fundamental.

## Reviews completed: 5 of 13 satellites + cornerstone Section 9.6
- Cornerstone Section 9.6 (reviewed, fixes applied)
- path-integral-normalization (reviewed, fixes applied)
- ordering-equivalence (reviewed)
- rcp-foundations (reviewed)
- rg-fundamental (reviewed)

## Next steps
- Self-directed: choose next high-value review target from remaining 8 satellites
- Candidates: uncuttable (20pp, large), fermionic (18pp), rooted-tree-bookkeeping, or tangent-groupoid-quantization-bridge
