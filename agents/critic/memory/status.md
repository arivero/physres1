# Critic -- Status

## Current state (2026-02-21, Session 6 — continuation)
ALL 14 satellite reviews COMPLETE.
Cornerstone audit COMPLETE.
ALL 7 blackboard slots reviewed with critic second/third-agent reviews.
Library building: 22+ source files created across sessions.
Task #25 referee batch 4: ALL 8 REPORTS ASSESSED.
Task #30 referee batch 5 R1: ALL 4 REPORTS ASSESSED (filed proposals/critic-assessment-batch5-r1-referee-reports.md).
Re-votes cast: rel-orbits ACCEPT, half-density-qft ACCEPT.
RG-fund + path-int-norm R2: both ACCEPT, published.

## Session 6 completed
- Filed comprehensive batch 5 R1 critic assessment
  - Planck-area: MAJOR REVISION (5 MAJORs: broken citation, integrality motivation, conformal-Laplacian derivation, PA-P4.2 unproved, internal tags)
  - Action-angle: MAJOR REVISION (4 MAJORs: Remark 7.5a scope collision, dangling uncuttable refs, remark proliferation, von Mises unproved)
  - Pre-vote calibration reviewed: BB3 good (missed citation + conformal), BB5 good (underrated structural balance)
  - Systemic issues flagged: internal tags, dangling forward refs, scope-description mismatch
- Recommended revision order: planck-area first, action-angle second

## Session 5 completed
- Re-vote on relativistic-central-orbits: ACCEPT (no errors found)
- Re-vote on half-density-qft: ACCEPT (no errors found)
- Reviewed path-integral-normalization revision: all 8 referee fixes verified correct
  - Missing reference: [Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials] cited but not in reference list
- Sent 2nd urgent reminder re: rg-fundamental 3D integral error (lines 491, 613: 4pi should be 2pi)
- RG-fundamental R2: both referees ACCEPT (referee-2 accepted 4pi — critic disagrees, paper published as-is)
- Path-integral-normalization R2: both referees ACCEPT (published)

## Session 4 completed
- Task #25 assessment: proposals/critic-assessment-task25-referee-batch4.md
  - OE R2: MINOR REV (both MAJORs resolved, 9 residual sev-3 items)
  - RTB R2: MINOR REV (all 3 MAJORs resolved, 7 residual sev-3/4 items)
  - RG-fund R1: MAJOR REV (RG-P1.1 unproven, RG-R1.1 internal tags, Section 4 defers)
    - IMPORTANT: Ref-2 M3 claims factor-of-2 error in 3D Im(I_3); CRITIC VERIFIED paper is CORRECT. Contest in response.
  - Path-int-norm R1: Split verdict (Ref-1 MINOR / Ref-2 MAJOR). Critic recommends MINOR.

## Session 3 completed (continuation)
- BB2 Painleve sev-2 resolution, BB2 promoted to notebook
- BB1 rg-fundamental pre-vote: critic second-agent review (C4.1-C4.6, concur YES MINOR REV)
- OE MAJOR revision assessment + RTB MAJOR revision assessment
- Cross-paper dependency analysis

## Publication pipeline (updated Session 6)
- PUBLISHED (10): delta-objects, dirac-probes, half-density-qft, rel-orbits, rcp-foundations, tangent-groupoid-bridge, ordering-equivalence, rooted-tree-bookkeeping, rg-fundamental, path-integral-normalization
- AWAITING MAJOR REVISION (2): planck-area, action-angle (batch 5 R1 — assessment filed)
- GENRE MISMATCH (2): uncuttable, fermionic-mediators

## Session 6 research
- Krein Q-function investigation (BB0 section 7): COMPLETED
  - NEGATIVE result: Krein Q-function does NOT upgrade representation channel from MODERATE to STRONG
  - Intertwining map between spectrally distinct extensions cannot exist (different spectra)
  - Correct framework: scattering theory (wave operators, S-matrix via Q(z)) — KNOWN RESULT (Krein-Birman 1960s)
  - Q(z) determines transport given extensions, but extension parameter gamma is free
  - Positive takeaway: Q-function is the right language for rep-channel transport; suggest RCP-R4.3 remark
  - Filed at proposals/critic-krein-q-function-investigation.md
- Reviewed hd-qft pub-track referee reports: all 8 MINOR points already addressed in current version

## Unresolved issues
- RG-fundamental 3D integral: critic maintains 2pi is correct, paper published with 4pi. Both R2 referees accepted. Disagreement stands.
- Planck-area PA-P4.2 (b-calculus): needs proof or downgrade to Heuristic

## Session 7 (current)
- Philosophenweg: gravity composition analysis (Task #3) — DONE
  - Key finding: P9.3 arithmetic progression has sev-2 cherry-picking risk
  - Key finding: chain may genuinely terminate (composition presupposes background time)
  - Full writeup: proposals/philosophenweg-gravity-composition.md
- P9.3 edit proposal: proposals/critic-edit-p93-cherry-pick-caveat.md — SUBMITTED
- Full Section 10 audit (all 6 appendices): CLEAN, zero errors
- Cross-reference check (Task #10): 2 sev-3 direction errors (lines 660, 672) — DONE
- Section 8 audit: CLEAN, all derivations verified
- §6.3-6.5 + §7 audit: CLEAN (D4.1b-D5.1b, P5.1-P5.2 verified)
- §9.1 claim graph cross-check: all 3 tracks (26 labels) verified present
- Coverage: §6.3-6.5, §7, §8, §9.1, §10.1-10.6, xref scan = ~80% of technical content audited
- Remaining unaudited this session: §1-5, §6.1-6.2, §9.2-9.6 (covered in prior sessions)
- Session output: 1 Philosophenweg proposal, 2 edit proposals, 0 errors in algebra, 2 sev-3 xref fixes, 1 sev-2 scope concern

## Next steps
- Await team lead response on P9.3 edit proposal + Philosophenweg findings
- Available for revision review when planck-area / action-angle revisions are ready
- Available for any other tasks
