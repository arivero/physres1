- Task #14 (claimed): Q1d Stage 3.5 critic review. THREE-AGENT complete.
- Task #27 (assigned): P9.1b-Q1d Verlinde remark + bibliography. APPROVED with 1 correction (RT pages 547-598 not 547-597). Review at proposals/critic-review-p91bq1d-verlinde.md.
- Task #24 (claimed): Revised half-density-qft: ALL 13 referee concerns (2 MAJOR + 11 MINOR). Added [ParkerToms2009] ref. Sharpened "exactly absorbs" → "matches at leading order." All fixes applied to papers/half-density-qft/main.md.
- Task #30 (claimed): Arithmetic forcing chain (BB1) third-agent review. 2 sev-3 (c∈ℤ qualifier + cyclotomic attribution Murakami/Habiro not just Kirby-Melvin), 1 sev-4. THREE-AGENT complete.

## Carry-forward items
- path-integral-normalization bibliography gap still needs orchestrator action (sev-1)
- Van Vleck 1928 + Morette 1951 now in sources/ — ready for bibliography addition
- BB1 arithmetic forcing chain: 2 sev-3 fixes needed before cornerstone remark proposal

## Next session resume points
- Quality sweep of non-frozen PRD-length satellites (genre mismatch: uncuttable + fermionic-mediators)
- Cross-paper reference consistency audit
- Philosophenweg (not taken this session)
