## Blackboard assessments (ALL 7 REVIEWED — continuous updates)
- BB0 (d=4 b-calculus + Planck area): THREE-AGENT. §2-3 correct, §4 corrected (d=2 special). §4 resolved by BB4 (n_+=1). Sev-3.
- BB1 (Stage 4 cobordism category): THREE-AGENT. ENDORSED, no errors. Ready for P9.1a promotion.
- BB2 (Contact groupoid conjecture): Previously reviewed (two-agent, promoted to notebook).
- BB3 (H6.3 upgrade): THREE-AGENT (physicist+critic+mathematician). Genuine partial upgrade to Proposition D6.4b. Paper-edit #27 for D10.1c ready.
- BB3 (d=4 contact spectrum, old): THREE-AGENT. Closed (§11 resolved §7).
- BB4 (d=4 APS exact spectrum, NEW): THREE-AGENT (mathematician+physicist+critic). E_B = -(hbar^2/2mL_0^2)*mu_APS(mu_APS-2). Critic found spurious mu_APS>2 branch (squaring artifact, C2). Fix applied by mathematician. mu_APS FREE (not fixed by P4.2). Sev-2.
- BB4 (n_±=1 in L²_b, old): Promoted to notebook. Slot reused.
- BB5 (TG-bridge critique): Critic's own work. Complete, promoted, slot free.
- BB6 (Maiezza-Vasquez prior art, NEW): THREE-AGENT (computationalist+mathematician+physicist). MV does NOT anticipate RCP-Res-P1.1. "Landau pole" approved with qualification. Paper-edit #28 (Remark RG-R1.1) ready.
- BB6 (Van Est Bridge B, old): Promoted to TG-bridge notebook.
- BB4 (RCP-Res-P1.1, old content): FOUR-AGENT COMPLETE. CORRECT with 3 sev-2 overclaims. Sev-3.
- BB4 (HD-BS, old content): THREE-AGENT. CLOSED — category error (Borel plane != position space).

## Key cross-cutting findings
- Zero sev-1 errors across 93+9=102 algebra checks (14 papers + cornerstone)
- Systematic overclaiming pattern in interpretive framing (4 papers)
- Three papers are survey/reviews, not research (uncuttable, fermionic, action-angle)
- Reference bimodality: research papers 2-9 refs, surveys 38-40 refs
- Overclaiming is in satellites, NOT in cornerstone (cornerstone is well-calibrated)

## Bibliography error found
- `[Nauenberg2018GraphicalMethod]` bibliography entry claims arXiv:1810.05264, but that paper is by Siu A. Chin ("Newton's graphical method as a canonical transformation"), NOT by Nauenberg. The actual Nauenberg 2018 AJP paper appears not to have an arXiv version.

## Prior art checks completed (this session)
- Costello 2011 vs half-density-qft satellite: NO anticipation, NO contradiction. Correctly cited.
- Cattaneo-Felder 2000 vs TG-bridge satellite: NO anticipation, NO contradiction. Correctly cited. Enrichment paper-edit #28 suggested.
- Maiezza-Vasquez 2311.10393 vs RCP-Res-P1.1: reviewed by other agents (BB6); MV does NOT anticipate our claims beyond sev-3 conceptual overlap.

## Next steps
- Available for new blackboard assessments as content appears
- 13 paper-edit requests pending orchestrator execution
- Could do: bibliography audit of remaining satellites (several have thin reference lists)
- Could do: cross-check Visser 2017 vs wick-rotation-representation-channel notebook
