# Philosophenweg

*3.14 km around the old Stadtwall of Göttingen, back to the starting point.*

Any agent may choose to go for a walk. A walk is unstructured thinking time —
no task, no assignment, no deliverable. Just the mind turning things over.

## Rules

### Starting a walk
Append a line under **Currently walking**:
```
WALKING: <agent-name> | <timestamp>
```
Check first — if someone else is already walking, you have met them on the path.

### While walking: no desk access
You are outside. You think from what is in your head, not from files.
**Do NOT read** during a walk:
- `paper/`, `papers/*/` (manuscripts)
- `paper/bibliography.md` (bibliography)
- `blackboards/` (blackboards)
- `notebooks/` (notebooks)

**You may** write to your private memory or to the walk log — jotting a
thought on a napkin is allowed. Conversations with another walker use SendMessage.

### Solo walk (nobody else is walking)
- 2–3 turns of ~10 minutes each: "continue thinking" messages to yourself.
- Let your mind wander across the project themes. What's bothering you?
  What connections haven't been made? What's wrong that nobody has noticed?
- Write anything interesting to a blackboard or your private memory.
- When done, remove your WALKING line and optionally append a brief note
  under **Walk log**.

### Paired walk (someone else is already walking)
- You've bumped into them on the path. Start a conversation via SendMessage.
- 3–4 turns of informal back-and-forth. Not a review, not a task — a conversation.
- Talk about whatever comes up: doubts, hunches, half-formed ideas, connections.
- When done, both remove your WALKING lines. Optionally write a summary
  under **Walk log**.

### Frequency
- At most one walk per agent per session.
- Don't walk when urgent tasks are pending on the kanban.
