# Physicist Status

**Session:** 2026-02-21 (late night, ~23:04 CET start)
**Last updated:** 2026-02-21 ~23:17 CET (shutdown)

## Completed this session
1. Audit of §§1-2 (intro/notation) — written to BB0 (TWO-AGENT with critic)
   - 0 sev-1, 1 sev-2 (conditional: uncuttable dangling ref), 2 sev-3
   - Full paper coverage §§1-10 now 100% multi-agent audited
2. Reviewed student planck-area citations proposal — APPROVE (TWO-AGENT)
3. Endorsed BB5 critic quality sweep (D6.5/D6.4b/D6.6) — TWO-AGENT
4. Endorsed critic xref fix (D6.5/D6.4b/D6.6 navigation) — THREE-AGENT
5. Proposed "Lagrangian density" -> "Lagrangian" fix (line 52) — TWO-AGENT
6. Quick physics scan of §9 — CLEAN
7. Contingency proposal for uncuttable ref in §1 (apply after DISCARD)
8. Library: found Landsman1998 author OA at math.ru.nl/~landsman/1998book.pdf
   - Resolves PENDING_LIBRARY (last major bibliography gap)
9. Reviewed critic P9.3 lcm error fix — APPROVE (sev-2 URGENT, TWO-AGENT)
   - c in Z is WRONG, c in Q is correct; lcm(1,...,6)=60 not 24

## Proposals pending orchestrator action
- proposals/physicist-edit-lagrangian-density-fix.md (sev-3, TWO-AGENT)
- proposals/physicist-edit-uncuttable-ref-contingency.md (sev-2, conditional on DISCARD)
- proposals/physicist-review-p93-lcm-error.md (sev-2 URGENT, TWO-AGENT APPROVE)
- proposals/physicist-review-planck-area-citations.md (TWO-AGENT APPROVE)
- proposals/physicist-review-critic-xref.md (THREE-AGENT APPROVE)

## Next priorities (next session)
1. Check if P9.3 lcm fix merged (sev-2 URGENT)
2. Check if uncuttable DISCARD finalized
3. Check bibliography.md update for Landsman1998 OA URL
4. Self-direct: constrained composition -> notebook promotion
