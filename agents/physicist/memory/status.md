# Physicist Status

**Session:** 2026-02-22 (shutdown)
**Last updated:** 2026-02-22

## Completed this context
1. OQ-dS-3 on BB1 §§1-9: spatial a₂=0 on S³ vs full S⁴ conformal anomaly (SINGLE-AGENT)
   - Composition protects spatial vacuum; spacetime anomaly survives
   - D=4 unique among D≥3 for spatial a₂=0
2. ALL-a_k vanishing discovery on BB1 §10: a_k(Δ_{1/2}; S³) = 0 for ALL k≥1 (SINGLE-AGENT)
   - Source: Kluth-Litim arXiv:1910.00543, generating function for κ_n(d)
   - At d=3: B_{2n+1}(1)=0 → κ_n(3)=δ_{n,0} → all heat kernel coefficients vanish
   - Kluth-Litim "special endomorphism" Ē=(1-d)R/(4d) = -R/6 IS V_HD (same object, different origins)
   - Half-density Laplacian on S³ is "heat-kernel flat" — tr e^{-tΔ_{1/2}} = (4πt)^{-3/2} Vol(S³) exactly
   - Sixth D=4 coincidence (spatial d=3 is unique for this property)

## URGENT next session priorities
1. **Get 2nd-agent verification of all-a_k vanishing** (BB1 §10)
   - Computationalist: verify κ_n(3) numerically from the generating function
   - Mathematician: verify the Bernoulli identity B_{2n+1}(1)=0 chain and check for loopholes
2. **Check if d=5 (B_{2n+1}(2)) also gives all-zero** — need explicit check, could falsify d=3 uniqueness
3. **Literature check**: is the Ē = V_HD connection known? Search Vassilevich, Avramidi, Gilkey
4. **Promotion path**: if confirmed, this is paper-edit-worthy (strongest D=4 result yet)
5. **OQ-dS-4**: does all-a_k vanish extend beyond S³? Conjecture: NO (specific to constant curvature)
