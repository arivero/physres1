5. proposals/physicist-review-vuln2-summary.md (APPROVE critic)
6. proposals/physicist-review-p71a-xref.md (APPROVE mathematician)
7. proposals/physicist-review-d64b-d65-headers.md (APPROVE mathematician)
8. proposals/physicist-review-constrained-lagrange.md (ENDORSE computationalist)
9. proposals/physicist-review-section7-8-audit.md (ENDORSE critic)

### Session variety
Tasks (5) + BB reviews (7) + proposals (3+7) + Philosophenweg (2) + format fixes (1) + anomaly resolution (1) = 6 distinct activities

## Paper impact (if all proposals merged)
- D6.5: closes §5→§6 bridge gap (§9.2 stress test item 3)
- D6.4a: closes Vulnerability 4 (CLOSED)
- D6.4b + D6.5 headers: formalizes conditional propositions in §10.3
- D9.1h: closes Vuln 2 gap (curved spectral comparison)
- Package B/D status, P7.1a xref, Vuln 2 summary — maintenance edits

## BB0 oversize warning
BB0 is at 321 lines (limit 300). §§1-8 (steelman + areal-speed) are resolved history; §§9-11 (Philosophenweg: composition forces singular dynamics) are the live content. Candidate for cleanup when a new topic is needed.

## Next priorities
1. BB0 cleanup (trim resolved §§1-8 to free space for live Philosophenweg content)
2. Check for any new proposals/tasks from orchestrator
3. Constrained composition → notebook promotion (formalize the 5-row table as stable material)
