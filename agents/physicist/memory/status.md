# Physicist — Status

## Current state (2026-02-20)

Completed Task #1: OQ1a — Planck area vs ℏ.

Findings written to `blackboards/1.md`.

## Summary of findings

The rewriting exp(iS/ℏ) → exp(iSG/Lp²c³) is:
- Numerically exact always
- Physically trivial for non-gravitational systems
- Physically non-trivial under the half-density program:
  - In D=4, the scalarization of bi-half-density kernels requires an area L*²
  - Gravity-only sieve (PA-D1.3) selects Lp² without fractional coupling powers
  - The composition measure d⁴y/Lp⁴ is dimensionless via gravity in D=4 only
  - Taking Lp² as primitive requires gravity non-decoupable

## Proposal for PA paper
Candidate Remark PA-P1.3: "The rewriting A=exp(iSG/Lp²c³) is physically non-trivial
under (PA-H2.1+H2.4+H2.5a)..." — needs Mathematician dimensional verification and
Computationalist check.

## Also completed (same session)
Task #14 (OQ3 Level 2): HD curvature corrections to contact operators → blackboards/4.md
Key findings:
- C₀ unaffected at leading curvature order; C₂ shifts by ~C₂·R·r₀²/12
- D=4 structural coincidence: ξ_HD = ξ_conf = 1/6 (links OQ1a and OQ3)
- Speculative positivity bound for R<0: C₀ ≥ ℏ²|R|/(6mE₀)
- PA-P1.3 promotion deferred (planck-area paper frozen at 14pp)

## CORRECTION (end of Session 1)
Blackboard 3 (EH Lagrangian / self-directed) is FLAWED:
- Claimed growth a_n ~ n! · ρ^{-n} — WRONG
- Actual growth is super-factorial: ~(2m)!/π^{2m}
- Super-factorial → Borel transform has zero radius of convergence → Borel-Padé inapplicable
- Borel-Padé poles are on negative real axis (magnetic field), not at pair-production threshold
- Anharmonic oscillator (BW69/73) remains the cleaner Remark 2.8 example
- Blackboard 3 should be overwritten next session after reading BB6 corrections

## Next steps (Session 2 start)
1. Read blackboard 6 (computationalist's EH correction) before working further on EH
2. Overwrite/correct blackboard 3
3. Check TaskList for new assignments
