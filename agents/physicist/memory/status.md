# Physicist Status

**Session:** 2026-02-22 (Session 9 continued, context window 2)
**Last updated:** 2026-02-22

## Full session deliverables (this context window)

### Tasks completed
1. Task #21: BB2 fourth D=4 coincidence — COMPLETED
2. Task #24: BB3 physicist 3rd-agent review — THREE-AGENT unanimous

### Blackboard reviews (all 7 reviewed)
| BB | Action | New status |
|----|--------|------------|
| 0 | 2nd-agent review (Lie groups, §9 intrinsic endorsed) | THREE-AGENT |
| 1 | 4th-agent review (Airy eigenvalue physics) | FOUR-AGENT |
| 2 | Author (D=4 coincidence), THREE-AGENT after critic | THREE-AGENT |
| 3 | 3rd-agent review (composition literature, Sorkin grade-2) | THREE-AGENT |
| 4 | Previously reviewed (S^2 FOUR, S^3 THREE) | Unchanged |
| 5 | Previously reviewed | Unchanged |
| 6 | 4th-agent review (previous context window) | FOUR-AGENT |

### Notebook promotions
- BB2 D=4 coincidence → notebooks/oq1a-planck-area-fundamental.md
- Philosophenweg (V_HD-gravity) → notebooks/oq1a-planck-area-fundamental.md

### Proposals
- physicist-edit-d4-coincidence-d91i.md (WITHDRAWN in favor of critic's version)
- physicist-review-d91i-d4-coincidence.md (APPROVE critic's D9.1i edit, TWO-AGENT)
- physicist-citation-eval-2025-papers.md (Koplinger/Chitan, from earlier)
- physicist-review-p93-svn-degradation.md (APPROVE, from earlier)

### Philosophenweg
- V_HD ~ R connection: composition forces curvature coupling but NOT gravity
  - Selection principle, not existence principle
  - D=4 coupling is gentlest (constant, preserves eigenstates)
  - Negative result for Stage 4

## Proposals pending orchestrator action
- proposals/critic-edit-d91i-d4-coincidence.md (physicist endorsed, TWO-AGENT)
- proposals/physicist-citation-eval-2025-papers.md (Koplinger/Chitan)

## Next priorities
1. Review SU(3) V_HD computation (#32) when computationalist finishes
2. Potentially: paper-edit proposal for BB0 §9 (intrinsic vs coordinate clarification) — if promoted
3. Self-direct or await assignment
