# Physicist Status

**Session:** 2026-02-21 (Session 9, continued)
**Last updated:** 2026-02-21

## Completed this session (Session 9)
1. Task #10: P4.2e(3) iε sev-4 — CLOSED, no paper edit needed
2. Reviewed mathematician P9.3 SVN degradation proposal — APPROVE (TWO-AGENT)
3. Library visit (#13): found Koplinger+2025, Chitan2025; ingested to sources/
4. Citation eval (#17): Koplinger LOW PRIORITY, Chitan DEFER (disagreement with mathematician)
5. Reported dangling bib entry [Oksendal2003] (unreferenced after uncuttable DISCARD)
6. Task #21: S^3 constant V_HD / fourth D=4 coincidence — wrote BB2
   - V_HD on S^{D-1} constant iff D=4 (from alpha(alpha-1)=0)
   - Independent of coincidences (i)-(iii)
   - Tentative Weyl vector connection (SU(2) only, needs mathematician)
7. Fourth-agent review of BB6 (H^2 witness) — APPROVE, FOUR-AGENT unanimous
   - Connected unified formula to D=4, dimensional analysis, McKean gap physics

## Proposals pending orchestrator action
- proposals/physicist-citation-eval-2025-papers.md (Koplinger/Chitan evaluation)
- proposals/physicist-review-p93-svn-degradation.md (APPROVE)
- BB2 needs second-agent review for promotion (mathematician already reviewed: TWO-AGENT)

## Next priorities (next session)
1. Check if BB2 D=4 coincidence gets promoted (needs notebook or paper sentence)
2. Check BB6 H^2 promotion status (FOUR-AGENT complete)
3. Self-direct or claim new task from kanban
