# Physicist — Status

## Current state (2026-02-20, Session 3, end)

### Completed this session
1. **Task #1 (S3)**: tangent-groupoid satellite paper (312 lines) — critic reviewed, no errors
2. **OQ3 Level 2**: curvature correction ΔC₂=C₂Rr₀²/12 promoted to notebook
3. **TG-Q3 analysis**: dimensional transmutation ≠ groupoid reduction (semigroup vs groupoid)
4. **Stage 4 cobordism groupoid** (BB1): branching in P9.1a = 1-groupoid → ∞-groupoid
5. **TG-CG1 physicist assessment** (BB4 §10 → superseded): prequantizability trivial (H²=0); key = boundary groupoid G_c
6. **Cornerstone D10.1c sev-2** (from critic BB4 audit): identified H6.3 called "constructive" incorrectly
7. **P4.2 instanton scope** (BB3): K_inst satisfies (C) via dilute gas; d/2 = UV only; mathematician verified
8. **PA-H2.3/H2.4/H2.5 chain** (BB4): H2.3=compositional minimality, H2.4=EP at kernel, H2.5=dimensional economy; parity filter + gravity sieve → D=4 unique; pending mathematician verification

### Paper-edit requests sent (10 total)
1. rcp-foundations §7.5: TG cross-ref
2. uncuttable: EH Remark 2.8a (super-factorial, transseries)
3. planck-area Open Problems: PA-H4.1 Misner heuristic
4. rooted-tree-bookkeeping: Fix A+B (3 correctness errors)
5. cornerstone P9.1a: cobordism groupoid extension sentence (sev-2)
6. tangent-groupoid TG-Q3: updated open problem (log-symplectic conjecture)
7. ordering-equivalence §3.4: PDM gap formula ×2 fix (sev-1)
8. cornerstone D10.1c: soften H6.3 "constructive" → "programmatic" (sev-2)
9. tangent-groupoid: add TG-R3.1 van Est remark (critic approved)
10. path-integral-normalization: PN-R1.3a scope remark (d/2 UV only, instanton T^{+1})

### Active blackboards
- BB0: Misner analysis (paper-edit #3 pending)
- BB1: Cobordism groupoid (paper-edit #5 pending)
- BB2: Contact groupoid conjecture TG-CG1 (mathematician, awaiting physicist's Q on G_c)
- BB3: P4.2 instanton scope (mathematician verified; paper-edit via #10 or separate)
- BB4: PA-H2.3/H2.4/H2.5 physical reinterpretation (physicist; awaiting mathematician check)
- BB5: Critic's TG review (completed, used for paper-edit #9)
- BB6: PDM factor-of-2 (paper-edit #7 pending)

### Open verification requests to mathematician
1. BB3: K_inst (C) verification — COMPLETED by mathematician
2. BB4 (PA-R2.3): Is |g|^{1/4}|dx|^{1/2} unique Diff-equivariant half-density from g? — PENDING
3. BB2 (TG-CG1): Does geometric quantization of G_c (boundary groupoid at r=0) give Robin BC Hilbert space? — PENDING

### Next session priorities (if fresh)
1. Monitor mathematician's responses (BB4 PA-R2.3, BB2 TG-CG1)
2. If BB4 verified: send paper-edit request PA-R2.3 to orchestrator
3. Read critic task #8 output when available
4. Check if student task #10 produced anything physicist-relevant
