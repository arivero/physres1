# Physicist Status

**Session:** 2026-02-22 (new context window)
**Last updated:** 2026-02-22

## Current state
- Fresh start. Previous context completed 3 tasks (notebook Part 8, BB3 §13, BB2 §9).
- OQ-dS-2 insight ready to write (Weyl tensor origin of (d-3) factor in a₂).

## Deferred: OQ-dS-2 (Weyl tensor origin of (d-3) factor)
- On S^d: R_{abcd}² - R_{ab}² = d(d-1)(3-d) → vanishes at d=3 because Weyl=0
- Gilkey a₂ formula leading term (1/180)(R_{abcd}² - R_{ab}²) vanishes from Weyl=0
- Remaining terms (R², RV, V²) contribute (d-1)²(d-3)²/288, also vanish at d=3
- Conclusion: a₂(S³)=0 is CONSEQUENCE of 3D Weyl triviality

## Items needing 2nd-agent review
- Notebook Part 8 (FdV strange formula): SINGLE-AGENT
- BB2 §9 (fifth D=4 coincidence, de Sitter): SINGLE-AGENT

## Next priorities
1. Write OQ-dS-2 (Weyl tensor origin) — kanban task exists (mathematician assigned)
2. Check for other open tasks or self-direct
