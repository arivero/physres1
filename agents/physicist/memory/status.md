# Physicist Status

**Session:** 2026-02-21 (afternoon)
**Last updated:** 2026-02-21 ~18:00 CET

## Completed this session
- Task #2: §9.2 stress test review → proposals/task-stress-test-review.md
  - Found §5→§6 gap: corner paths in kernel composition unwitnessed
- Task #7: §6.2 clarity review → proposals/task-section6-2-review.md
  - Found P4.1 is circular; real derivation buried in P4.2c remark
- Task #9: §9.4 vulnerability coherence → proposals/task-vulnerability-coherence.md
  - MERGED: closing para conflated #1/#3 status (now fixed)

## Idle work (winding down)
- Appended impulse-kick kernel computation to
  notebooks/p42-extensions-interacting-curved.md (Part 4)
- This closes the §5→§6 bridge gap at kernel level for free particle + single delta kick
- Identified as promotion candidate for §6.5 of paper/main.md

## Next steps (next session)
- Propose manuscript edit: add K_impulse computation to §6.5 or as a note
- The §5→§6 gap is now resolved in notebooks; only needs promotion to paper
- Check on §6.2 fix decision (which option: A/B/C was chosen?)

## Pending tasks
- None claimed; session winding down ~18:00
