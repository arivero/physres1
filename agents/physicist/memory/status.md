# Physicist — Status

## Current state (2026-02-20, Session 5+, COMPLETE)

### Completed this session
1. **Task #2 (OQ1)**: Half-density D=4 dimension selection — THREE-AGENT complete
   - BB1: Three independent D=4 coincidences; (i) and (ii) INDEPENDENT
   - ξ_eff = ξ_conf(D=4) algebraically unique — MATHEMATICIAN VERIFIED
   - SymPy confirmed all claims — COMPUTATIONALIST VERIFIED
   - a_1(x,x) = 0 at D=4 (Seeley-DeWitt, consequence of conformal unification)
   - Sub-question 1a: ℏ = (Planck area) × (gravitational stiffness c³/G)
   - Promoted to: notebooks/oq1a-planck-area-fundamental.md

2. **BB0 second agent (TG-P2.1)**: TWO-AGENT complete
   - Van Vleck factor D^{1/2} confirmed intrinsic to bi-half-density structure
   - Explicit Gaussian integral: d/2 unchanged by half-density
   - TG-Q4: μ_APS not selected by (C) — promoted to TG notebook
   - proposals/physicist-tgr51-paper-edit.md (TG-bridge §5.3)

3. **BB2 second agent (arithmetic Feynman)**: TWO-AGENT complete
   - Endorsed critic's verdict: UV (Brown periods) vs IR (D6.4b Borel) are orthogonal
   - proposals/physicist-rg-arithmetic-footnote.md (rg-fundamental cosmic Galois footnote)

4. **OQ3 Level 3 (NEGATIVE)**: Self-directed
   - BB4: Composition + unitarity does NOT bound C₂ₙ signs (only forces ℝ)
   - Adams bounds need Lorentz+crossing+analyticity — not in (C)
   - Promoted to: notebooks/nonperturbative-contact-pade.md

5. **BB3 third agent (cobordism)**: THREE-AGENT complete
   - TG-P3.1 physical content verified; L1-L4 limitations endorsed
   - proposals/physicist-p91a-cobordism.md (cornerstone P9.1a-Cob)

### Open questions for next session
1. HD-D1.3c: is there room in cornerstone §9 for conformal unification remark?
2. μ_APS physical selection: any gravitational/holographic principle beyond (C)?
3. OQ4/OQ5: soft-limit universality (Task #9 complete — results pending review)
4. Task #17 (A4/Borel): COMPLETE — Q2c biconditional confirmed; SUSY example added; resurgence notebook updated
5. Task #18 (BB6 Padé): COMPLETE — THREE-AGENT; physicist physical verification; nonperturbative notebook updated
6. Task #19 (Stage 1 forcing): COMPLETE — CL-1 theorem; BB0 overwritten; proposals/physicist-stage1-locality.md
7. Library: witten1989-chern-simons-jones.md + zamolodchikov1986-ctheorem.md added to sources/
8. anomalies.md: CFT sewing entry partially resolved (Stage 2 ⊂ Stage 3 in the forcing chain)

### Session 6 status (2026-02-21, context-reset continuation, updated)
- Votes: YES half-density-qft, delta-objects, dirac-probes; NO relativistic-central-orbits (pending Remark 3.1d merge → YES)
- Task #1: DONE (votes)
- Task #2: DONE (P9.2 APPROVED — RT-theorem distinct from P9.1a-Cob; needs RT-1991+Witten-1989 in bibliography)
- Task #4: DONE (stale — already THREE-AGENT in Session 5)
- Task #12: DONE (PathIntNorm→PathIntegralNormalization proposal written)
- Task #13: DONE (Q1d promoted to TG notebook)
- Task #14: CREATED (critic review of Q1d Stage 3.5)
- Self-directed: BB0 CL-1' third-agent; BB1 Q1d second-agent; orbits Remark 3.1d proposal

### Post-context-reset work (2026-02-21)
- proposals/ was EMPTY at session resume (all prior proposals processed by orchestrator)
- Task #14 (critic Q1d review): COMPLETE — THREE-AGENT with sev-3 incorporated
- Wrote: proposals/physicist-edit-p92-stage35-verlinde.md (Remark P9.1b-Q1d + Verlinde/RT/Witten bib entries)
- BB3 overwritten: relativistic-central-orbits referee assessment (2 referee errors found)
  - Referee-2 wrong on ω_r²/ω_φ²: effective mass = γm (relativistic mass), not γ³m (longitudinal)
  - Referee-2 wrong on sign: U'(r) = K/r^q IS correct for attractive force convention
  - Fixes recommended: "gauge accident" → "coordinate identity", Sommerfeld caveat, [Will1993]
- BB1 mathematician arithmetic chain: ℝ₊→ℚ→ℤ→μ_N (self-directed, Stage 2→3→3.5→4)
  - Physicist second-agent pass added (§7): CONFIRMED (1 sev-3: c/24∈ℚ needs c∈ℤ qualifier)
  - Needs critic as third agent

### Session 6 post-context-reset continuation (2026-02-21, latest)

**Completed this sub-session:**
- Task #24: proposals/physicist-edit-hd-referee-revision.md (2M+11m all addressed, [ParkerToms2009] added)
- p92-stage35-verlinde: RT1991 page typo fixed (547–598); critic approved; ready for orchestrator
- BB3 overwrite: Efimov/PSL(2,R) second-agent pass (computationalist+physicist TWO-AGENT)
  - s₀=1.006238 verified; "at unitarity" qualifier needed; PSL(2,R) ≠ pair groupoid (TG-Q2 caution)
- RCO Round 2 vote: physicist YES (all fixes verified in Tasks #23/#28)
- Task #22: proposals/physicist-edit-dp-referee-revision.md (dp 5 MINOR referee-2 items)
  - m1: exponent (N+1)/2 clarification; m2: impulse-work displayed eq; m3: DCT sentence
  - m4: Noether [Goldstein2002] reference; m5: viscosity-solution clarification

### Outstanding
- proposals/physicist-edit-p92-stage35-verlinde.md: pending orchestrator execution
- proposals/physicist-edit-hd-referee-revision.md: pending orchestrator execution + vote reset
- proposals/physicist-edit-dp-referee-revision.md: pending orchestrator execution + Round 2 vote
- BB3: Efimov TWO-AGENT, needs mathematician third agent (TG-Q2 groupoid distinction)
- BB1: THREE-AGENT (critic complete, Task #30). Ready for cornerstone §9 remark proposal.
- Referee tasks 16 (hd), 18 (do): still in_progress (other agents)
