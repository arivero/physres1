# Physicist Status

**Session:** 2026-02-21 (evening, ~21:41 CET start)
**Last updated:** 2026-02-21 ~23:00 CET

## Completed this session

### Tasks (5 completed)
- Task #1: Areal-speed paper pub-readiness → DISCARD (THREE-AGENT)
- Task #12: d/2 uniqueness chain review (BB2) → AIRTIGHT (THREE-AGENT)
- Task #17: phi^4 truncation benchmark proposal → FOUR-AGENT APPROVED
- Task #18: Efimov/PSL(2,R) review (BB6) → THREE-AGENT, Q3 overclaim

### Blackboard reviews (5 blackboards reviewed)
- BB0 §9: Philosophenweg "Composition forces classical singular dynamics"
- BB1 §10: Spectral dimension physicist review (z=2 Lifshitz physics)
- BB2: d/2 uniqueness physicist review (P-R1 through P-R5)
- BB4 §10: S² ordering witness physicist review (V_HD hand-verified, FOUR-AGENT)
- BB6 §10: Efimov/PSL(2,R) physicist review (de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan 1976)

### Proposals written (3 original + 4 reviews)
**Original:**
1. proposals/physicist-edit-impulse-kernel.md — D6.5 (THREE-AGENT APPROVED)
2. proposals/physicist-edit-vuln4-phi4-benchmark.md — D6.4a (FOUR-AGENT APPROVED)
3. proposals/physicist-edit-vuln4-status.md — SUPERSEDED by #2

**Reviews:**
4. proposals/physicist-review-package-status.md (APPROVE critic proposal)
5. proposals/physicist-review-vuln2-summary.md (APPROVE critic proposal)
6. proposals/physicist-review-p71a-xref.md (APPROVE mathematician proposal)

### Session variety
Reviews (5) + proposals (3) + Philosophenweg (1) + format fixes (1) = 4 distinct activities

## Paper impact (if all proposals merged)
- D6.5: closes §5→§6 bridge gap (§9.2 stress test item 3)
- D6.4a: closes Vulnerability 4 (from PARTIALLY CLOSED to CLOSED)
- D9.1h: closes Vuln 2 gap (explicit curved spectral comparison) — mathematician's proposal, physicist reviewed
- Package B/D status updates, P7.1a xref, Vuln 2 summary fix — critic/mathematician proposals, physicist reviewed

## Next session priorities
1. Check if proposals were merged; update vulnerability status if so
2. Constrained-path composition (Philosophenweg §9 follow-up): can composition force Lagrange multipliers?
3. Efimov notebook promotion (Q1+Q2 from BB6)
4. Any new mathematician work needing physicist review
