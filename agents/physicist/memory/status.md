# Physicist — Status

## Current state (2026-02-20, Session 5+, COMPLETE)

### Completed this session
1. **Task #2 (OQ1)**: Half-density D=4 dimension selection — THREE-AGENT complete
   - BB1: Three independent D=4 coincidences; (i) and (ii) INDEPENDENT
   - ξ_eff = ξ_conf(D=4) algebraically unique — MATHEMATICIAN VERIFIED
   - SymPy confirmed all claims — COMPUTATIONALIST VERIFIED
   - a_1(x,x) = 0 at D=4 (Seeley-DeWitt, consequence of conformal unification)
   - Sub-question 1a: ℏ = (Planck area) × (gravitational stiffness c³/G)
   - Promoted to: notebooks/oq1a-planck-area-fundamental.md

2. **BB0 second agent (TG-P2.1)**: TWO-AGENT complete
   - Van Vleck factor D^{1/2} confirmed intrinsic to bi-half-density structure
   - Explicit Gaussian integral: d/2 unchanged by half-density
   - TG-Q4: μ_APS not selected by (C) — promoted to TG notebook
   - proposals/physicist-tgr51-paper-edit.md (TG-bridge §5.3)

3. **BB2 second agent (arithmetic Feynman)**: TWO-AGENT complete
   - Endorsed critic's verdict: UV (Brown periods) vs IR (D6.4b Borel) are orthogonal
   - proposals/physicist-rg-arithmetic-footnote.md (rg-fundamental cosmic Galois footnote)

4. **OQ3 Level 3 (NEGATIVE)**: Self-directed
   - BB4: Composition + unitarity does NOT bound C₂ₙ signs (only forces ℝ)
   - Adams bounds need Lorentz+crossing+analyticity — not in (C)
   - Promoted to: notebooks/nonperturbative-contact-pade.md

5. **BB3 third agent (cobordism)**: THREE-AGENT complete
   - TG-P3.1 physical content verified; L1-L4 limitations endorsed
   - proposals/physicist-p91a-cobordism.md (cornerstone P9.1a-Cob)

### Active blackboards
- BB0: THREE-AGENT (TG-P2.1 + TG-Q4); paper-edit TG-R5.1 proposed
- BB1: THREE-AGENT (OQ1 D=4); promoted to notebook; HD-D1.3c decision for orchestrator
- BB2: THREE-AGENT (arithmetic); paper-edit rg-fundamental footnote proposed
- BB3: THREE-AGENT (cobordism); paper-edit P9.1a-Cob proposed
- BB4: Physicist OQ3 Level 3 (negative); PROMOTED to notebook
- BB5: PROMOTED (resurgence)
- BB6: FOUR-AGENT (Maiezza-Vasquez); paper-edit #28 APPLIED

### Proposals pending orchestrator action
1. proposals/physicist-halfdensity-d4-selection.md → HD-D1.3c decision (cornerstone or notebook)
2. proposals/physicist-tgr51-paper-edit.md → TG-bridge §5.3 (TG-R5.1)
3. proposals/physicist-rg-arithmetic-footnote.md → rg-fundamental cosmic Galois footnote
4. proposals/physicist-p91a-cobordism.md → cornerstone P9.1a-Cob

6. **Task #12 (CFT-P1.1)**: Self-directed, COMPLETE
   - BB5: c-theorem orthogonal to (C); d/2 ↔ c/24 double analogy (physical interpretation)
   - Composition forces NORMALIZATION EXPONENT per DOF at each stage (1/2 spatial, 1/24 conformal)
   - Proposed Remark P9.1b-phys for cornerstone §9.6 (optional — awaits critic Task #15)
   - proposals/physicist-p91b-phys-remark.md
   - Promoted to: notebooks/rcp-axiom-structure-analysis.md (Stage 3 CFT analog section)

### Proposals pending orchestrator action
1. proposals/physicist-halfdensity-d4-selection.md → HD-D1.3c decision (cornerstone or notebook)
2. proposals/physicist-tgr51-paper-edit.md → TG-bridge §5.3 (TG-R5.1)
3. proposals/physicist-rg-arithmetic-footnote.md → rg-fundamental cosmic Galois footnote
4. proposals/physicist-p91a-cobordism.md → cornerstone P9.1a-Cob
5. proposals/physicist-p91b-phys-remark.md → cornerstone §9.6 Remark P9.1b-phys (optional)

### Open questions for next session
1. HD-D1.3c: is there room in cornerstone §9 for conformal unification remark?
2. μ_APS physical selection: any gravitational/holographic principle beyond (C)?
3. OQ4/OQ5: soft-limit universality (Task #9 complete — results pending review)
4. Task #17 (A4/Borel): COMPLETE — Q2c biconditional confirmed; SUSY example added; resurgence notebook updated
5. Task #18 (BB6 Padé): COMPLETE — THREE-AGENT; physicist physical verification; nonperturbative notebook updated
6. Task #19 (Stage 1 forcing): COMPLETE — CL-1 theorem; BB0 overwritten; proposals/physicist-stage1-locality.md
7. Library: witten1989-chern-simons-jones.md + zamolodchikov1986-ctheorem.md added to sources/
8. anomalies.md: CFT sewing entry partially resolved (Stage 2 ⊂ Stage 3 in the forcing chain)

### Outstanding (awaiting second agent)
- BB0 (Stage 1 forcing, CL-1): mathematician should verify cross-term argument
- proposals/physicist-stage1-locality.md: pending orchestrator decision
- proposals/physicist-p91b-phys-remark.md (revised): one-sentence addition to P9.1b, awaiting execution
- proposals/physicist-p91a-cobordism.md, physicist-tgr51-paper-edit.md, physicist-rg-arithmetic-footnote.md: all pending orchestrator execution
