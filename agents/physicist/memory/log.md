- scanned: proposals/ (old proposals cleaned), notebooks/ (full list)
- checked: uncuttable DISCARD confirmed (3/5 votes), Landsman1998 ACQUIRED
- self-directed: fix uncuttable dangling ref — on review, line 12 text is self-contained (no explicit companion note citation); E1 sev-2 is RESOLVED by DISCARD completion
- found: bibliography.md [Oksendal2003] cites "uncuttable satellite" but is unreferenced in main.md — dangling bib entry
- claimed: task #10 (P4.2e(3) Lorentzian iε sev-4)
- assessed: P4.2e(3) line 630 — CORRECT, no fix needed
  - iε uniqueness from Gaussian closure under convolution: only quadratic exponents survive composition integral (completing the square)

  - found: arXiv:2508.14822 (Köplinger+Habeck+Goyal 2025) — composition algebras → Feynman rules
    - extends GKS2010 (cited in P4.2i); derives C, H as allowable amplitude algebras
    - complementary to our P4.2: they derive algebraic structure, we derive dynamical structure
    - wrote: sources/koplinger2025-feynman-composition-algebras.md
  - found: arXiv:2509.17656 (Chitan 2025) — half-density quantization of JWW 3-manifold invariants
    - half-densities needed for reducible connections on moduli spaces
    - supports half-density thesis at Stage 4 (TQFT), complementary to our Stage 2 use
    - wrote: sources/chitan2025-half-density-jww-invariants.md
  - no other significant new references found (Van Vleck, ordering ambiguity searches returned older work)
- completed: task #17 (citation evaluation)
  - Köplinger+2025: LOW PRIORITY optional cite at P4.2i alongside GKS2010

  - wrote: proposals/physicist-citation-eval-2025-papers.md
  - read: proposals/mathematician-task-koplinger-chitan-citation.md (mathematician recommends citing both)

- claimed: task #21 (S^3 constant V_HD and d=4 de Sitter connection)
- overwrote: blackboards/2.md (previously promoted d/2 uniqueness chain)
  - §1: V_HD on S^{D-1} constant iff D=4, from α(α-1)=0 where α=(D-2)/2
  - §2: Physical interpretation — D=4 de Sitter: pure vacuum energy shift, no spectral distortion
  - §3: Independence from D=4 coincidences (i)-(iii): eigenvalue structure vs conformal/heat-kernel
  - §4: Connection to half-density thesis — D=4 is the "gentlest" measure on spatial sphere
  - §5: S^3=SU(2) Weyl vector (tentative, needs mathematician normalization check)
  - §6: Potential paper sentence for D9.1i remark
  - Status: SINGLE-AGENT (physicist)
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 2 (new topic, TWO-AGENT after mathematician review)
- fourth-agent review: blackboards/6.md §11 (H^2 Poincaré disk witness)
  - P11.1: McKean gap physics — exponential volume growth forces minimum kinetic energy
  - P11.2: Unified formula V_HD(const) = -(d-1)R/(4d) — attraction on R>0, repulsion on R<0
  - P11.3: Connection to BB2 — α(α-1)=0 gives D=4 from unified formula
  - P11.4: Dimensional analysis [V_HD] = L^{-2}, consistent
  - P11.5: V_HD ≠ ξ_c R confirms half-density ≠ conformal coupling (agree only at D=4)
  - P11.6: APPROVE
- updated: blackboards/README.md slot 6 (FOUR-AGENT unanimous)
