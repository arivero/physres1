# Physicist — Activity Log

## 2026-02-20 (Sessions 1-5, compressed)
- Wrote BB1 (OQ1a Planck area), BB4 (OQ3 contact operators), BB3 (EH Lagrangian witness)
- Created tangent-groupoid-bridge satellite paper (312 lines)
- BB1 OQ1 D=4 half-density analysis; TWO-AGENT with mathematician
- Second-agent reviews: BB0 (TG-P2.1), BB2 (arithmetic Feynman), BB3 (cobordism P9.1a-Cob)
- Wrote BB4 OQ3 Level 3 NEGATIVE (composition+unitarity does NOT bound contact coeffs)
- CFT-P1.1 c-theorem completed; P9.1b-phys remark proposed
- Multiple proposals: TG-R5.1, rg-arithmetic footnote, P9.1a-Cob, P9.1b-phys
- Applied sev-2/sev-3 fixes to BB4, BB5 (critic corrections)
- Appended: TG notebook, resurgence notebook, nonperturbative notebook

## 2026-02-21 (Sessions 6-9, compressed)
- Voted: YES hd-qft, YES delta-objects, YES dirac-probes, NO→YES rel-orbits (after revision)
- Reviewed/approved: P9.2 q-forcing, P9.3 (Murakami/Habiro), multiple referee revision proposals
- Audited: §§1-8 full paper (with critic §§7-8); all CLEAN
- Library: found Landsman1998 OA, Koplinger2025, Chitan2025
- Key work: BB2 fourth D=4 coincidence (V_HD on S^{D-1} constant iff D=4)
- BB reviews: all 7 BBs reviewed, multiple at THREE/FOUR-AGENT consensus
- Philosophenweg: V_HD forces curvature coupling but NOT gravity (selection, not existence)
- Efimov/PSL(2,R): third-agent review, SL(2,R) = de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan 1976
- Promoted: BB0 table to notebook Part 5, BB2 D=4 to OQ1a notebook
- Areal-speed assessment: DISCARD recommended (no original result, genre mismatch)
- P4.2e(3) iε sev-4: CLOSED (Gaussian closure, no fix needed)
- Fixed P9.3 lcm error (critic caught, physicist approved)
- Multiple proposals merged in Sessions 8-9

## 2026-02-22 (this session)
- compressed: memory files (log.md, status.md)
- read: BB0 (new: SU(3)/SU(4) verified, Thm M0.3 analytic proof V_HD=-R/6)
- wrote: patches/physicist-patch-d91o-analytic.md (D9.1o epistemic upgrade: numerical→analytic)
- reviewed: BB5 (product additivity, computationalist) — 2nd-agent APPROVE, sev-3 H^3xS^3 fixed
- wrote: BB3 (OQ1a answer: composition→curvature coupling, selection not existence)
- noted: a_1=0 is UNIVERSAL (not D=4-specific) — correction to OQ1a notebook (iii)
- updated: README slots 0,3,5

## Key verdicts still relevant
- V_HD formula -(d-1)R/(4d) is NOVEL (no direct literature hit)
- D=4 is unique for constant V_HD on S^{D-1} (fourth coincidence)
- Composition forces curvature coupling as selection principle, not gravity existence
- Areal-speed: DISCARD (assessment in memory/areal-speed-assessment.md)
