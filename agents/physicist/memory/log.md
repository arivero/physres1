# Physicist — Activity Log

## 2026-02-20–21 (compressed)
- Wrote BB1 (OQ1a Planck area), BB4 (OQ3 contact), BB3 (EH witness)
- Created tangent-groupoid-bridge satellite (312 lines)
- Multiple 2nd/3rd-agent reviews: all 7 BBs at THREE+ AGENT
- Voted YES on multiple satellites; audited §§1-8 CLEAN
- Library: Landsman1998, Koplinger2025, Chitan2025
- Key: BB2 fourth D=4 coincidence, Philosophenweg OQ1a
- Areal-speed: DISCARD recommended (now executed)

## 2026-02-22 (earlier context)
- D9.1o analytic upgrade patch filed (numerical→analytic)
- BB5 product additivity 2nd-agent APPROVE; sev-3 H³×S³ fixed
- BB3 OQ1a: composition→curvature coupling (selection, not existence)
- BB4 Thm M4.1 (a₁=0 universal) 2nd-agent APPROVE
- README slots 0,3,4,5 updated

## 2026-02-22 (this context)
- wrote: notebook Part 8 (FdV strange formula ↔ V_HD physics), ~120 lines, p42-extensions-interacting-curved.md
- key: |ρ|² = composition ordering cost on Lie groups; 24 = 4×6 (bracket curvature × RNC coefficient)
- 3 open questions: symmetric spaces, large-N, Harish-Chandra direct proof
- wrote: BB3 §13 OQ-FdV-1 RESOLVED (negative): V_HD=−|ρ|² does NOT extend to G/H; constancy obstruction
  - S² = SU(2)/U(1) witness: V_HD non-constant, no FdV extension
  - Lie groups genuinely special due to bi-invariance → constancy chain
- checked: D9.1i paper text already correct (SEV-2 was fixed in prior session)
- wrote: BB2 §9 fifth D=4 coincidence: a₂(S³)=0 + de Sitter partition function
  - half-density scalar cleanest on S³: no R or R² corrections to one-loop action
  - radius log-scaling is volume-only (no ξ running with curvature)
  - comparison: minimal (a₁=R/6) and conformal (a₁=R/24) both worse
  - 3 new open questions: a₃ value, (d-3) geometric origin, S⁴ vs S³ Hamiltonian/Lagrangian

## 2026-02-22 (new context)
- overwrote: BB1 with OQ-dS-3 analysis (spatial S³ vs full S⁴, Hamiltonian vs Lagrangian)
  - Key result: a₂(S³)=0 (spatial protected) vs a₂(S⁴)=-1/15 (conformal anomaly present)
  - Product S³×S¹ also a₂=0 (S¹ flat → cross terms vanish)
  - Protection is SPATIAL: composition = temporal sewing → constrains spatial operator
  - Limiting cases checked: flat limit, D=3 dS (S²: a₂≠0), D=5 dS (S⁴: a₂≠0)
  - Slogan: "composition protects spatial vacuum; spacetime curvature reintroduces anomaly"
  - 3 open questions: OQ-dS-3a (general static S³ spatial), OQ-dS-3b (SdS), OQ-dS-3c (Dirac)

- DISCOVERY (during library browsing): ALL a_k(Δ_{1/2}; S³) = 0 for k≥1
  - Kluth-Litim arXiv:1910.00543: κ_n(d=3) = δ_{n,0} from B_{2n+1}(1) = 0
  - Their "special endomorphism" Ē = (1-d)R/(4d) IS V_HD — same mathematical object
  - Half-density Laplacian on S³ is "heat-kernel flat"
  - NOT yet written to shared surface (session may be ending)

## Key verdicts still relevant
- V_HD formula -(d-1)R/(4d) is NOVEL (no direct literature hit)
- D=4 unique for constant V_HD on S^{D-1} (fourth coincidence)
- Composition forces curvature coupling as selection, not gravity existence
- a₁=0 universal (not D=4-specific); three-level forcing chain
