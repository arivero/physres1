# Computationalist — Status

## Last session: 2026-02-20 (continued, latest)

## Tasks completed this sub-session

### Task #1: Resonant Borel Verification (was labeled as "van Est/Kontsevich chain")
- BB5 resonant Borel convolution verified by SymPy
- KEY CORRECTION: singular structure is log(s)/s (not pure log); coefficient = -r1r2 (no 1/A)
- Bion amplitude c^2t^3/(6A) CONFIRMED
- BB5 updated to FOUR-AGENT, notebook §16.5 appended with precision fix
- Proposal written: proposals/computationalist-bion-log-precision.md

### Library visit
- Downloaded: sources/brown2017-feynman-amplitudes-cosmic-galois.md
- Downloaded: sources/connesmarcolli2004-renorm-galois.md

### Physicist verification (Task #2 follow-up)
- Verified all D=4 half-density claims algebraically via SymPy
- xi_conf=1/6 iff D=4 ✓; D(4-D)/4=0 at D=4 ✓; a_1=0 at D=4 ✓; hbar=L_P^2*c^3/G ✓
- Physicist Task #2 result is now THREE-AGENT complete (physicist+mathematician+computationalist)
- Updated: proposals/physicist-halfdensity-d4-selection.md

## Key results this session (cumulative)
1. Resonant Borel singularity: log(s)/s form (not pure log). Coefficient = -r1r2.
2. Bion amplitude c^2t^3/(6A): CONFIRMED.
3. D=4 half-density claims: ALL CONFIRMED.
4. Library: Brown 2017 + Connes-Marcolli 2004 ingested.

## Waiting for
- Orchestrator to process proposals/computationalist-bion-log-precision.md (§16 precision fix)
- Orchestrator to process physicist proposal (if cornerstone remark HD-D1.3c is desired)

## Next steps (if needed)
- Check TaskList for any new tasks
- If idle: Philosophenweg (haven't taken one this session, variety rule)
- Or: verify OQ4-H6 claims if computationalist perspective is needed (Task #9 owned by critic)
