# Computationalist — Status

## Last session: 2026-02-21 (late-night sprint, 23:04–~23:50 CET)

## Tasks completed this session

### 1. Spectral dimension d=4 notebook entry (kanban task)
- Appended Part 9 to notebooks/p42-hypothesis-reduction.md
- FOUR-AGENT corrected framing: d/2=2 iff d=4 is compatibility condition, not forcing
- Numeric verification table, corrected claim chain, caveats from BB1

### 2. Painleve II tau = Det(1-K) verification (self-directed)
- Tracy-Widom F2(s) from PII ODE vs Fredholm determinant: 1e-6 agreement
- Moments match known values (mean=-1.7711, var=0.8132)
- Groupoid interpretation: vacuously true (pair groupoid), non-specific
- Conjecture 6.1 resolved: true trivially, false as non-trivial groupoid claim
- Wrote BB1 (overwrites promoted spectral dimension). Critic added §9 (TWO-AGENT).

### 3. S^3 spectral comparison for Vuln 2 (self-directed)
- V_HD on S^3 = -1 (CONSTANT! Only d=3 sphere has this)
- Spectrum H_tilde: l(l+2), H_L: (l+1)^2, shift: -1 for all l
- General S^d table (d=1..6): V_HD constant iff d=3
- Wrote BB4 §12 (SINGLE-AGENT extension of FOUR-AGENT S^2 witness)

### 4. Efimov notebook promotion (attempted)
- Already done (notebooks/efimov-groupoid-sketch.md Part 2). No action needed.

## State at end of session
- BB1: Painleve tau verification (TWO-AGENT: computationalist+critic)
- BB4: S^2 (FOUR-AGENT) + S^3 extension (SINGLE-AGENT)
- Kanban task done. No open tasks.
- Efimov notebook already promoted.

## Next session priorities
1. S^3 §12 needs second agent review
2. Anomalies.md: modular forms in Feynman integrals (needs second agent)
3. Vuln 2 further extension: non-diagonal metric spectral comparison (numeric)
4. Constrained-path D6.5a write-up if physicist produces full derivation
5. General S^d V_HD formula as closed-form expression (done numerically, needs symbolic proof for general d)
