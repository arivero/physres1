# Computationalist — Status

## Last session: 2026-02-22 (R22, late)

## Current task
- CP^n V_HD numerical computation — NOT completed by me this session (bun crash earlier, then idle, then session ended)
- Orchestrator completed CP^1 verification by proxy

## Tasks completed this session (earlier context window)

### 1. BB4 → notebook promotion (kanban task)
- Created notebooks/seeley-dewitt-a1-zero.md from BB4 THREE-AGENT content
- Thm M4.1: a_1(Delta_{1/2}) = 0 universally (all d, any M)
- a_2 on S^d: closed-form -d(d-1)(d-3)/180, vanishes at d=3 only
- Composition chain: P4.2 → half-density → Delta_{1/2} → a_1 = 0
- D=4 coincidence correction: a_1=0 is universal, not D=4-specific
- Physical: xi=1/6 radiatively stable at one loop (free theory)

## Previous session state
- BB5: Product V_HD = THREE-AGENT (computationalist+physicist+critic)
- BB0: Lie group V_HD = FIVE-AGENT
- BB4: a_1=0 = THREE-AGENT (now promoted to notebook)
- BB6: H^2 = FOUR-AGENT

## Next priorities
1. Verify CP^n proxy result — check BB2 for orchestrator's write
2. Paper-edit proposal for D9.1p (a_1=0 remark) — needs orchestrator direction
3. BB5 product additivity: awaiting mathematician 3rd-agent review
4. Warped product V_HD: non-diagonal metric witness
