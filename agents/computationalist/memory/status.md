# Computationalist — Status

## Last session: 2026-02-22

## Tasks completed this session

### 1. S^3 spectral comparison — full D9.1i formalization (kanban task #1)
- Re-verified all S^3 results with comprehensive SymPy script
- Updated BB4 §12 with formal D9.1i, corrected S^d table, SU(2) interpretation
- Paper-edit proposal: proposals/computationalist-edit-d91i-s3-witness.md
- THREE-AGENT after mathematician §14 review

### 2. H^2 (Poincare disk) spectral witness — D9.1k (task #14)
- V_HD = 1/4 - 1/(4 sinh^2 rho) on H^2 (SymPy verified)
- Non-compact, negative curvature, continuous spectrum [1/4, inf)
- Left ordering erases spectral gap 1/4 = -R/8
- Paper-edit proposal: proposals/computationalist-edit-d91k-h2-witness.md
- FOUR-AGENT unanimous (computationalist+mathematician+critic+physicist)

### 3. V_HD curvature coupling comparison (task #23)
- V_HD(const) = -(d-1)R/(4d) on constant-curvature spaces
- Distinct from conformal coupling, DeWitt ordering, and Seeley-DeWitt a_1
- V_HD is non-perturbative (exact); R/6 is perturbative (heat kernel)
- Flat R^d: V_HD = (d-1)(d-3)/(4r^2), vanishes at d=3
- BB6 §12 (SINGLE-AGENT)

### 4. D=4 coincidence verification
- alpha(alpha-1)=0 on S^{D-1}: D=4 unique nontrivial
- Weyl vector: V_HD = -4|rho|^2_Killing, Freudenthal-de Vries: |rho|^2 = dim(G)/12
- SU(2): |rho|^2 = 1/4, V_HD = -1. VERIFIED.

### 5. Notebook promotion
- Appended Part 7 to notebooks/p42-extensions-interacting-curved.md
- Covers: S^2, S^3, H^2, general formula, D=4 coincidence, flat space, agent status

## State at end of session
- BB4: S^2 (FOUR-AGENT) + S^3 (THREE-AGENT)
- BB6: H^2 + curvature comparison (FOUR-AGENT for H^2, SINGLE for §12)
- BB2: D=4 coincidence (TWO-AGENT, critic reviewing)
- Two paper-edit proposals: D9.1i and D9.1k
- All promoted to notebook Part 7

## Next session priorities
1. D9.1k paper-edit needs orchestrator application
2. Non-diagonal metric witness (beyond constant curvature)
3. SU(3) V_HD computation (first non-spherical Lie group)
4. Check if Luiz-de Oliveira Cramer-Rao mechanism differs from our composition route
