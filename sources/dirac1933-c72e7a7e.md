THE  LAGRANGIAN IN  QUANTUM MECHANICS. 
By  P.  A.  M.  Dirac. 
(Received  November  19,  !932). 

Quantum  mer.hanics  was  built  up  on  a  foundation  of ana 
logy  with  the  Hamiltonian 
theory  of  classical  mechanics. 
This  is  because  the  classical  notion  of  canonica1 coordinates 
and  momenta  was  found  to  be  one  with  a  very  simple quan 
tum  analogue,  as  a  result  of  which  the  whole  of  the  classi 
cal  HamUtonlan  theory,  which  is  just  a  structure  built  up 
on  th'ls  notion,  could  be  taken  over  ln  all  its  details  tnto 
quantum  ~echanics. 

Now  therl'

to  work  in  terms  of c.oordinates and  velocities  instead  of co 
Ol'dinatcs and  momenta.  'fhe  two formulations  are,  of  course, 
closely  related,  but  there  are  reasons  for  believing  that  the 
Lagrangian  one  ls  the  more  fundamental. 

In  the  first  place  the  Lagrangian  method  allows  one  to 
collect  together  all  the  equations  of motion and express  them 
as  the  stationary  property  of a certain  action  function. 
(This 
action  funct1on  ls  just  the  time - integral  of the Lagrangian). 
'l'here  is  no  correspou,Jing  action  principle 
in  terms  of 
tb.e  coordinates  and  momenta  of  the  Hamiltonian  theory. 
Secondly  the  Lagrangian  method  can  easily  be  expressed 
on  account  of  the  action  function  being 
ielativistlcally, 
a  relativ.istic  invariant;  whlle  the  Hamiltonian  method  is 
essentially  non - relativistic 
in  form,  since  it  marks  out  a 
particular 
time  variable  as  the  canonical  conjugate  of  the 
Hamil ton tan  function. 

For  these  reasons  it  would  seem  desirable  to  take  up  the 
question  of  what  corresponds  in  the  quantum  theory  to  the 
Lagrangian  method  of  the  classical  theory.  A  little  con 
sideration  shows, however, that  one  cannot  expect  to  be  ablt>

to  take  over  the  classical  Lagrangian  equations  in  any  very 
~iirect  way.  These  equations  involve  partial  derivatives  of 
the  Lagrangian  with  respect  to the coordinates and velocities 
and  no  meaning  can  be  given  to  such  derivatives  in  quan 
tum  mechanics.  The  Ollly  differentiation  process  that  can 
to  the  dynamica1 variables  of 
be  carried  out  with  respect 
brackets 
quantum  mechanics  is  that  of  forming  Poisson 
and  this  process  leads  to  the  Hamiltonian  theory.  1 

We  must  therefore  seek  our  quantum  Lagrangian  theory 
in  an  indirect  way.  We must  try  to  take  over the  ideas  of 
the  classical  Lagrangian  theory,  not  the  e qua  ti  on s  of the 
-classical Lagrangian  theory. 

Contact 

Transformations. 

Lagrangian  theory  is  closeiy  connected  with  the  theory 
of  contact  transformations.  We  shall  therefore  begin  with 
a  discussion  of  the  analogy  between  classical  and  quantum 
contact  transformations.  Let  the  two  sets  oi  variables  be 
Pr,  q,.  and  Pr,  Qr,  (r =  1,  2  ...  n)  and  suppose  the  q's  and 
Q's  to  be  all  independent,  so  that  any  fundion  of  the dyna 
mical  variables  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of them. It  is well 
known  that  in  the  classical  theory  the  transformation  equa 
tions  for  this  case  can  be  put  in  the  form 
as

In  the  quantum  theory  we  may  take  a  representation  in 
wbich  the  q's  are  diagonal,  and  a  second  representation  in 
which  the  Q's  are  diagonal.  There  will  be  a  transformation 
function  (q' IQ')  connecting  the  two  representations.  We shalJ

usual  representatives  (q'lalq''), 
(q' la IQ')= J (q' I a I q")dq" (q" IQ')=  f (q' IQ'') dQ'' (Q'' la IQ'). 
From  the  first  of  these  definitions  we  obtain 

(Q'lalQ'') by 

(q' I qr IQ')=  q; (q' I Cl)

and  from  the  second 

(q' IQ .. i Q') =  ~(rt  IQ') 

(q' I Pr IQ')=  ih  d~~ (q' IQ')•

Note  the  difference  in  sign  1n  (3)  and  (5). 

Equations  (2)  and  (4)  may  be  generalised  as  follows.  Let 
f(q)  be  any  function  of  the  q's  and  g(Q)  any  function  of th~ 
Q's.  Then 
(q' I f(q)  lllQ)I  Q')=  J f (q' I f(q)  I q") dq'  (q" I Q')dQ"  (Q" I g (Q)I Q') 

= f (q') u (Q')(q'  IQ'). 

Further,  if  f,,, (q)  and  gk(Q).  (k=  1,  2  ...  ,  m)  denote  two sets. 
of  functions  of .the  (js  and  Q's respectively, 

(q' I ~k  {k(q)gk( Q) I Q') =  Lk {k( q') {lk ( Q') · ( q' IQ'). 
Thus  if  a  is  any  function  of  the  dynamical  variables  and we 
suppoi3e it  to  be  expressed  as  a  function  a(qQ) of the  q's  and 
Q's  in  a  ,, wr.11 - ordered u  way,  that  is,  so  that  it  consists  of 
a  sum  of  terms  of  the  form  f (q) g (Q), we  shall  have 

(q' I (J; (qQ) IQ')=  a(</ Q') (q' IQ').

This  is  a  rather  remarkable  equation,  giving  us a connectlon

the  analogue  of  the  classical  function  S,  which  is  what  we 
had  to  prove. 

Incidentally,  we  have  obtained  another  theorem  at  the 
same  time,  namely  that  equations  (1)  hold  also in  the  quan

The  transformation  functions  in  (8)  and  (9)  are very  fun

to  find  that  they  have  their  classical  analogues,  expressible 
simply  in  terms  of the  Lagrangian.  We  have  here  the  na

we shall  take  the  case  of a single degree of freedom, although 
the  argument  applies  also to  the  general  case.  We shall use

where  qk denotes q at the  intermediate  time t1c, (k = 1,  2 ...  m). 
Equation  (11)  at  first  sight  does not  seem to  correspond pro 
perly  to  equation  (10),  since  on the  right-hand  side  of  (11) 
we  must  integrate  after  doing  the  multiplication  whlle  on 
the  right - hand  side  of  ( 10)  there  is  no  integration. 

Let  us  examine this  discrepancy  by  seetng what becomes 
of  (11)  when  we regard  t  as  extremely  small.  From  the  re 
sults  (8)  and  (9}  we  see  that  the  integrand  in  (11)  must  be 
of the  form e•Ffh where  F  ls  a  function  of qr,  q1,  q2 .. . qm, qt 
which  remains  finite  as  h  tends  to  zero.  Let  us  now pic 
ture  one of the  intermedhi.te q's,  say  q,.,  as  varying  conti 
nuously  while  the  others  are  fixed.  Owtng  to  the  smallness 
of h,  we  shall  then  in  general  have  F1h  varying  extremely 
rapidly.  This  means  that  e•F/h  will  vary  periodically  with a 
very  high  frequency  about  the  value  zero,  as  a  result  of 
which  its  integral  will be  practically  zero.  The  only impor 
tant  pa.rt in  the  domain of integration  of  q" ls  thus  that  for 
wh'ich a  cornparattvely large  variation  in  q1c produces  only 
a  very  small variation  in  F.  This  part  is the neighbourhood 
of  a  point  for  which  F  is  stationary  with  respect  to  small 
variations  in  q1c. 

We  can  apply  this  argument  to  each  of the  variables  of 
integration  in  the  right - hand  side  of  (11)  and  obtain- the 
result  that  the  only  important  part  in  the  domain  of  integ 
ration  ls  that  for  which. F  is  stationary  for  small  variations 
in  all  the  intermediate  q's.  But,  by  applying  (8)  to  each  of 
the  small time  sections, we  see  that  F  has  for  its  classical 
analogue

wh'ich is  just  the  action  function  which  classical  mechanics 
requires  to  be  stationary  for  small  variations  in  all  the  in 
termediate  q's.  This  shows  the  way  in  which  equation  ( 11} 
goes  over  into  classical  results  when  h  becomes extremely 
small. 

We  now return  to  the  general  case when  h  is  not  small. 
We  see  that,  for  comparison with  the quantum theory,  equa-

tion  (10)  must  be  interpreted  in  the  following way.  Each  of 
the  quantities  A  must  be  considered  as  a  function  of the  q's 
at  the  two  times  to  which  it  refers.  The  right- hand  side 
is  then  a  function,  not  only  of  qr  and  q1,, but  also  of  q1,  q2, 
...  Qm, and  in  order  to  get  from  it  a  function  of  Qr  and  qt 
only,  which  we  can  equate  to  the  left - hand  side,  we  must 
substitute  for  q1,  q2 •••  qm their  values  given  by  the  action 
principle.  This  process  of substitution  for  the  intermediate 
q's  then  co1Tesponds to  the  process  of  integration  over  all 
values  of these  q's  in  (11). 

Equation  (11)  contains  the  quantum  analogue of the  action 
principle,  as  may  be  seen  more  explicitly  from the following 
argument.  From  equation  (11)  we  can  extract  the  statement 
(a  rather  trivial  one) that,  if  we  take  specified  values for qr 
and  Qt, then  the  importance  of  our  considering  any  set  of 
values  for  the  intermediate  q's  is  determined  by  the  impor 
tance  of  this  set  of values  in  tlte  integration  on  the  right 
hand  side  of (11).  If  we  now make  h  tend to  zero, this  state 
ment  goes  over  into  the  classical  statement  that,  if  we take 
specified  values  for  Qr and  Qt, then  the  importance  of  our 
considering  any  set  of  values  for  the  intermediate  q's is zero 
unless  these  values  make  the  action  function  stationary. 
This  statement  is  one way  of formulating the  classical action 
principle.

to  the  fact  that  in  particle  theory 
it  is  a  function  of just  the  one  variable  t.  Thus  the  one in

theory  is  to  be  generalised

We  introduce  at  each  point  of space - time  a  Lagrangian 
denslty,  which  must  be  a  function  of  the  c-0ordinates and 
their  first  derivatives  with  respect  to  z,  y,  z- and  t,  corre 
spond1ng to  the  Lagrangian  in  particle  theory  being  a  func 
tlon  of  coordinates  and  velocities.  The  integral  of  the  La 
grangian  density  over any (four - dimensional) region of space 
time  must  then  be  stationary  for  all  small  variations  of  the 
coordinates  inside  the  region, provided the  coordinates on the 
boundary  remain  invariant. 

It  is  now  easy  to  see  what  the  quantum  analogue  of  all 
this  must  be.  If  S  denotes  the  integral  of the  classical  La 
grangian  density  over a particular  region  of space - time,  we 
should  expect  there  to  be  a  quantum  analogue  of e's11a. cor 
responding  to  the  (qt I qr)  of particle  theory.  This  (qt I qr)  is 
a  function  of  the  values  of the  coordinates  at  the  ends  of 
the  time  interval  to  which  it  refers  and  so we should expect 
the  quantum  analogue of  eiS/'h  to  be  a function  (really a func 
tional)  of  the  values  of  the  coordinates  on  the  boundary  of 
the  space- time  region.  This quantum  analogue will  be a soft 
of ,,generalized transformation function".  It cannot in general  be 
like  (qt I qT), as  giving  a  transformatlon  between 
interpreted, 
one  set  of  dynamical  variables  and  another,  but  it  is a four 
dimensional  generalization  of  (qt I qr)  in  the  following sense.

with  the  g.t.f.'s  for  the  very  small  sub-regions

the  quantum  analogue  of  the  action  principle  applied  to

The  square  of  the  modulus  of  the  transformation  function

and  lying  entirely  outside  any  light- cone  having  its  vertex 
on  the  surface.  The  square  of  the  modulus  of  the  g.  t.  f. 
then  gives  the  probability  of  the  coordinates  havlng  speci 
fied  values  at  all  points  on  the  later  surface  for  a  state  for 
which  they  are  given  to  have  definite  values  at  all  points 
on  the  earlier  surface.  The  g.t.f.  may  in  this  case  be  con
