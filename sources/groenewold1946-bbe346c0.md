Mo : observational meaning,  determined  b y   the  relation  with  what 
is  (in  a  certain  connection)  understood  as observation, 
Mr:/ormal  meaning,  determined  with respect to the mathematical 

formalism without  regard to observation. 

Only  Mo  is  of  physical  interest,  M t  is  only  of  academic  interest. 
Dealing  with  M t m a y   sometimes  suggest  ideas,  fruitful  in  the  sense 
of  Mo,  but  m a y   often  lead  one  astray. 

1.02  Quantization.  Very  simple  systems  suffice  for  demonstrating 
the  essential  features  of  c~ and  ~.  In  elementary  classical  point  me- 
chanics  a  system  is  described  b y   the  coordinates  q  of  the  particles 
and  the  conjugate  momenta  p.  We  only write  down  a  single  set  p,q, 
corresponding  to  one  degree  of  freedom.  Any  other  measurable 
quantity  (observable)  a  of the  system  is  a  function  a(p,q)  of p  and  q 
(and  possibly of the  time  t).  The  equations  of motion  can  be express- 
ed  in  terms  of  P  o  i s s o  n  brackets 

(a,b)  =  ~p  O--q---Oq  ~p" 

8a  8b 

Oa  ~b 

(1.01) 

When  the  same  system  is  treated  in  elementary  quantum  me- 
chanics,  the  (real)  quantities  a  are  replaced  b y   (H  e  r  m  i t  i a  n) 
operators  a,  which  now represent  the  observables.  In  the  equations 
of  motion  the  P  o i s s o n  brackets  (1.01)  are  replaced  b y   the  ope- 
rator  brackets 

[a,b]  =~ 

i  (ab--ba) ( h =  h 

h  P  1 a  n  c k's  constant  of action).  (1.02) 

Problem  ~I  is  to  find  the  correspondence  a  -+  a  (other  problems 
are  stated  further  on). 
1.03  Statistical  character.  The  statements  of  quantum  mechanics 
on  observations  are  in  general  of statistical  character.  Problem  ~ is 
whether  the  statistical  quantum  processes  could  be  described  b y   a 
statistical  average  over  uniquely  determined  processes  (statistical 
description  of the  1st kind,  type  S t)  or not  (statistical  description  of 
the  2nd kind,  type $2). The  observability of the uniquely determined 
processes m a y  be required  (proper  statistical  description,  type So) or 
not  (formal  statistical  description,  type  St).  (Classical  statistical 
mechanics,  e.g.  are  properly  of the  1st  kind,  type  Sot). 

1.04  Transition  operator.  Before  going  on  we  have  to  deal  for  a 

moment  with the operators and the wave functions. 

ON  THE  PRINCIPLES  OF  ELEMENTARY  QUANTUM  MECHANICS  407 

The H  e r  m  i t  i a n  operators a  form a non-commutative.ring, The 
normalized  elements  (wave  functions)  of  (generalized)  H  i 1 b e r  t 
space on which they act from the  left are denoted by ~%, the adjoint 
elements on which they act from the right  are denoted by ~ .   Unless 
otherwise  stated  the  inner  product  of  ~  and  ~0, is simply  written 
~ % .   The  outer product  of ~*~ and  ~v defines the  transi~on  operator

orthonormality is  expressed  by 

the completeness by

(1.05) 

In  continuous  regions  of  the  parameter  t~  the  W  e i e r  s t  r  a s z 
8-symbol  must  be  replaced  by  the  D  i r  a c  8-function and  the sum 
by  an  integral.  (1.04)  and  (1.05)  show  that  every  (normalizable) 
function  qo can  be  expanded  into 

~p =  Z  1~, q~  with  1~, =  q~  q~. 

(1.06)

kv~%,, ~-  ~ 8 ~ ,   and  ~* k*  =

8~,,/?~ 

(1.07) 

(that  is  why  they  are  called  transition  operators).  (1..04) gives 
k~k~,~,  =  k ~ , ~ , .  

(1.08) 

I n   particular  kin,  and  k~  are  for  ~  @ v  orthogonal  projection 

operators  (belonging  to  ~  and  ?,  respectively). 

The  trace  of  an  operator  a  (resulting  when  a  acts  towards  the 
right  upon  itself  from  the  left,  or  opposite;  when  it  bites  its  tail) 
is  (according  to  (1.05))  defined b y  

Tra  =  X $~ a  ~%. 

(1.09) 

(Because  the  right  hand  member  isinvariant  under  unitary  trans- 
formations  of  the  %,,  this  definition  is  independent o f   the  special 
choice of the  complete orthonormal  system  Of $~).  This  gives 

(1.04)  and  (1.05)  can  be  written 

Tr(kv~a )  ----- c?~ a  ~%. 

Trkv~ =  ~v~, 

2g kt~ ~  = 1

and  further  imply 

Tr(k~,vk~,#)  =  ~ , t ~ , ,  

Z  k~Tr(kt~a )  ----- a  (for every a). 
/z,v 

(1.13) 

(1.14) 

(1.13)  and  (1.14)  show  that  every  operator  a  (with  adjoint  a t)  can 
be  expanded  into 

a  =  Z  ~ k ~   with  ~v~ =  Tr(kv~,a). 

(1.15) 

is  the  matrix  element  (1.10)  of  a  with  respect  to  q% and  ~%. 
a ~  
It  follows  further  that  if  Tr(ac)  =  0  for  every  a,  then  c  =  0  and 
therefore  (1.14)  is  equivalent  to 

X. Tr(k~,b)  Tr(kma )  =  Tr(ab)  (for every a  and  b). 
/ZW 

(1.16) 

Further 

Tr(ab)  =  Tr(ba).

operator

functions  ~0~, with  eigenvalues  at,

can  serve as reference system.  In  this  representation  (1.15)  takes  the 
diagonal  form 

a  =  ~  at~km,.

1.05  Statistical  operator  x).  The  q u a n t u m   state  of a  system  is  said 
to be pure,  if it  is represented  b y   a  wave function  %,.  The  statistical 
operator  of the  state  is defined b y  the  projection  operator  kt, ~ of q~. 
We  will  see that  the  part  of the  statistical  operator  is  much  similar 
to that  of a  statistical  distribution  function.  The  most  general  quan- 
tum  state  of  the  system  is  a  statistical  mixture  of  (not  necessarily 
orthogonal)  pure  states  with  projection  operators  kin,  and  non- 
negative  weights  k w  which  are  normalized  b y  

z 

=  1. 

(1.21) 

(In  some  cases  the  sum  diverges  and  the  right  member  actually 
should  symbollically  be  written  as  a  8-function).  The  statistical 
operator  of the  mixture  is  (in  the  same  way as  it  would be  done  for 

ON  T H E   P R I N C I P L E S   OF  E L E M E N T A R Y   Q U A N T U M   M E C H A N I C S   4 0 9 "  

a  distribution  function)  defined  by 

k  =  Z 

and because of  (1.21)  normalized by 

T r k   =  1. 

(1.22) 

(1.23) 

(we will  always write  1 for the  right  member,  though  in  some cases 
it  actually should  be  written  as  a  g-function).  For  brevity we oKen 
speak of the state  (or mixture)  k. 

An arbitrary non-negative definite normalized H  e r  m  i t  i a n  ope- 
rator k  ( T r k   =  1) has non-negative eigenvalues k~, for which X k~---- 1 

b~ 

and  corresponding eigenstates with projection operators ku~,. There- 
fore  k  can  according  to  (1.20)  be  expanded  in  the  form  (1.22)  and 
represents  a  mixture  of  its  (orthogonal)  eigenstates  with  weights 
given by the eigenvalues. 

The  statistical  operator  k~,~, of  a  pure  state  is  from the  nature  of 
the case idempotent (k~,~ ----- k ~ ) .   If on the other hand an idempotent 
normalized  H  e r  m  i t  i a n  operator  k  is expanded  with  respect  to 
its  eigenstates  k~,  with  eigenvalues  k~,  we  get 

k 2 = k ,  

/#~  : k ~ ;  

Trk-----  1,  E  k ~ =   1, 

(1.24) 

F 

so that  one eigenvalue kv is  1, all other are 0. Then k  is the projection 
operator  of  the  pure  state  % 

k  =  kv~. 

(1.25) 

Therefore  pure  states  and  only  these  have  idempotent  statistical 
operators. 

Suppose  the  normalized  statistical  operator  k  of  an  arbitrary 
quantum  state  is expanded  in  some way into  other normalized  (but 
not  necessarily orthog0nal )  statistical  operators  k,  with  non-nega- 
tive  weights  k, 

k----Ek,k,; 

k,  ~>0. 

r 

(1.26) 

This  gives 

k  - -   k 2 = - E   k,  (k, - -   k, 2)  +  ½ Z  k , k , ( k ,   - -   k,) 2. 

(1.27) 

~" 

rjS 

If  we  expand  with  respect  to  pure  states  k,  (k, 2 ----- k,),  (1.27)  be- 
comes 

k  - -   k 2  =  ½ Z  k,ks(k,  - -   k,) 
' i S  

(1.28) 

410 

H . J .   GROENEWOLD 

This  shows  that  k - -   k 2  is  a  non-negative  definite  operator.  If the 
given  state  is  pure  (k 2 =  k)  all terms  at  the  right  hand  side of  (1.27) 
(which  are  non-negative  definite)  must  vanish  separately.  For  the 
terms  of the  first  sum  this  means  that  all  states  1~ with  non-vanish- 
ing  weight  (k, >  0)  must  be  pure,  for the  terms  of the  second  sum  it 
means  further  that  all these  states  must  be identical  with  each  other 
and  therefore  also  with  the  given  state  (k,  ----- k).  The  given  state  is 
then  said  to  be  indivisible.  If  the  given  state  is  a  mixture,  k -  
k 2 
must  be  positive  definite.  Then  at  least  one  term  at  the  right  hand 
side  of  (1.28)  must  be  different  from  zero.  This  means  that  at  least 
two  different  states  k,  and  ks  (k,  :#  ks)  must  have  non-vanishing 
weight  (k, >  0,  ks >  0).  The  given  state  is then  said  to  be  divisible. 
Thus  pure states and only these are indivisible.  This  has been proved 
in  a  more  exact  w a y  b y   v  o  n  N e u m a n n l ) .  

1.06  Observation.  In  order  to  establish  the  observational  meaning 
Mo,  one  must  accept  a  definite  notion  of observation.  We  deal  with 
3  different  notions: 

Oc: the  classical  notion:  all  o b s e r v a b l e s  a~,q)  can  be  measured 
without  fundamental  restrictions  and  without  disturbing  the system, 
Oq: the  quantum  notion  (elucidated  in  2) :  measurement  of an  ob- 
servable,  which  is  represented  b y   an  operator  a,  gives  as  the  value 
of the observable one of the eigenvalues a~, of a  and leaves the system 
in  the  corresponding  eigenstate  kin,  (cf.  (1.20));  if  beforehand  the 
system  was in  a  state  k,  the  probability  of this  particular  measuring 
result  is  T r ( k k ~ ) .  

Suppose for a  moment  that  the  statistical  description  of  quantum 
mechanics  had  been  proven  to  be  formally  of  the  1st  kind  S~,  but 
with  respect  to  Oq properly  of  the  2nd  kind  S2v  Then  (if  any)  the 
only  notion,  which  could  give  a  proper  sense  to  the  formal  descrip- 
tion,  would be 

Ou: the  utopian  notion: 

the  uniquely  determined  processes  are 
observable  b y   methods,  hitherto  unknown,  consistent  with  and 
complementary  to  the  methods  of  Oq. 

With  respect  to  quantum  theory  classical  theory  is  incorrect, 
though  for  many  purposes  it  is  quite  a  suitable  approximation  (for 
limh-+  0).  With  regard  to  the  utopian  conception  quantum  theory 
would  be  correct,  but  incomplete.  In  this  a  description  is  called 
correct  if  none  of  its  statements  is  in  contradiction  with  observa- 
tional  data.  It  is  called  complete  if  another  correct  description, 

ON  THE  PRINCIPLES  OF  ELEMENTARY  QUANTUM MECHANICS  41 

which  leads  to  observable  statements  not  contained  in  the  given 
description,  is  impossible.  This  need  n o t   imply  that  all  possible 
observational  statements  can  be  derived  from  a  complete  theory. 
1.07  The/undamental  controversy. Problem  ~ intends  to  state  cer- 
tain  aspects  of  the  well  known  controversy  about  the  statistical 
character  of  quantum  mechanics in  a  form  fit  for  a  reasonable  dis- 
cussion.  Such  a  discussion  is  only  possible  as  long  as  the  theory  is 
accepted  as  essentially correct  (or rejected  and  replaced  by  a  more 
correct theory). The completeness of the  theory may be. questioned. 
The  physical  reasonings  of  B  o h  r  a.o.  and  the  mathematical 
proof  of  y o n   N e u m a n . n l )  
(reproduced  in  1.08)  have  shown 
that  (with respect  to  0q)  the  statistical  description of quantum  me- 
chanics  is properly of the 2nd kind S~  (problem ~t). Yet m a n y  of the 
opponents  did  not  throw  up  the  sponge,  some because they did  not 
grasp the point, others because they perceived a gap in the reasoning. 
It  seems  that  a  great  m a n y   of  the  escapes  (as  far  as  they  consider 
quantum  mechanics  as  essentially  correct)  debouch  (if  anywhere) 
into  an expectation,  which either is already contented with a formal 
statistical  description  of the  l ste  kind  S~, or moreover hopes to  give 
such  a  description  a  proper  sense  of  type  S ~   by  proclaiming  the 
utopian  notion  of  observation  0,.  The  examination  of this  concep- 
tion is problem ~2. 

Even  if  one  did  (we  could  not  satisfactorily)  succeed in  proving 
the  formal  impossibility  of type  SJ  (and  consequently of type  S~), 
m a n y   of  the  opponents  would  not  yet  strike  the  flag.  We  have  al- 
ready gone  to  meet  them  in  trying  to  formulize some  of their  most 
important  objections in a form fit for fruitful discussion.  It  would be 
like flogging a dead horse in trying to  do so with all vague objections 
they  might  possibly  raise.  Actually  that  is  their  own  task.  If  they 
succeed  in  doing  so,  we  try  to  prove  the  imposs!bility,  they  try  to 
find the realization  of their  (formal or proper)  expectations.  Formal 
expectations  can  be  realized  by  a  formal  construction,  proper  ones 
also  require  the  realization  of the  type  of observations  from  which 
they  draw  their  observational  meaning.  As  soon  as  the  opponents 
succeed  in  finding  a  realization,  we  will  (formally  or  properly)  be 
converted (but not  a  minute before). As often as we succeed in prov- 
ing  the  impossibility,  some  of  the  opponents  m a y   formulize  (if 
anything)  new objections for ever.  At best  t h e y  might be  compelled 
to  retreat  step  by  step,  they  could  never  be  finally vanquished.  It 

412 

H.J.  GROENEWOLD 

m a y   also  happen  that  nobody  succeeds  in  going  further.  Thus 
because  of running  on  an  infinite  track  or  into  a  dead  one,  the  con- 
troversy  m a y   be  left  undecided.  Meanwhile  we  expect  that  in  an 
infinite  regression  the  opponents  obiections will lose more  and  more 
interest  after every retreat. 

1.08  v  o n  N  e u  m  a  n  n's  proo/.  The  only  states  with  a meaning 
Moq  with  respect  to  quantum  observations  Oq  are  quantum  states 
(pure  states  or mixtures).  Therefore in  a statistical  description of the 
1st  kind  SSq a  quantum  state  should  be  described  as a  statistical  en- 
semble of quantum  states.  This is impossible for a pure state,  because 
such  a  state  is  indivisible  (cf.  1.05).  Then  the  statistical  description 
of quantum  mechanics  must  (with respect to  quantum  observations) 
be  of the  2nd  kind  S~2q. This  is in  our  present  mode  of expression  the 
point  of  v  o n  N  e u  m  a  n  n's  proof 1).  It  should  be  noted  that  in 
1.05  the  admission  of non-negative  probabilities  only  (non-negative 
weights  and  non-negative  definite  statistical  operators)  is  an  essen- 
tial  (and  natural)  feature  of  the  proof. 

Now  before  going  into  the  details  of  problem  ~2,  we  first  turn  to 

problem  a  (we need  a5 for  ~2)" 

1.09  Correspondence  a(p,q)  <  > a.  In  passing  from  classical  to 
quantum  mechanics,  the  coordinate  and  momentum  q  and  ~b,  for 
which 

(p,q)  =  1, 

(1.29) 

are  replaced  b y   coordinate  and  momentum  operators  q  and  p,  for 
which 

p,q  ~  1  (i.e.  p q - -   qp  =  ~ ) .  

(1.30) 

p  and  q are  the  generating  elements  of the  commutative  ring  of clas- 
sical  quantities  a(q,p),  p  and  q  the  generating  elements  of  the 
non-commutative  ring  of  quantum  operators  a.  The  non-commuta- 
bility  (1.30)  of  p  and  q  entails  that  the  quantities  a(p,q)  cannot 
unambiguously be replaced  b y  a(p,q).  The  ambiguity  is of the  order 
of  h.  The  classical  quantities  a(p,q)  can  be  regarded  as  approxima- 
tions  to  the  quantum  operators  a  for  lira  h--,'-  O.  The  former  can 
serve as guides  to get  on  the  track  of the  latter.  Problem  al  asks  for 
a rule of correspondence a(p,q)  ~  a, b y  which the quantum  operators 
a  can  be uniquely  determined  from the  classical  quantities  a(p,q). 

In  practical  problems  no  fundamental  difficulties  seem  to  occur 

ON  THE  PRINCIPLES  OF  ELEMENTARY  QUANTUM  MECHANICS  41 

in  finding  the  appropriate  form  of  the  required  operators  a.  This 
suggests the problem  (not  further  discussed here)  whether  all or only 
a  certain  simple  class of operators  a  occur in  quantum  mechanics. 

Suppose for a  moment  that  all relevant  quantum  operators  a  had 
been  fixed  in  one  or  other  way.  Then  one  might  ask  for  a  rule 
a  --> a(p,q),  b y   which  the  corresponding  classical  quantities  a(p,  q) 
are  uniquely  determined  (problem  ~2)- Problem  ~2  would  be  easily 
solved  in  zero  order  of  ~,  ambiguities  might  arise  in  higher  order. 
Now (with respect to 0q) the classical quantities  have only a meaning 
as  approximations  to  the  quantum  operators  for  lira  h ~  O. There- 
fore, whereas in zero order of ~ it is hardly  a  problem, in higher  order 
problem  ~2 has  no  observational  meaning  Mo¢  (with  respect  to  0q). 
Problems  ~1 and  ~2 could be combined  into  problem  a3, asking  for 
a  rule  of  one-to-one  correspondence  a(p,q)  <  > a  between  the  clas- 
sical  quantities  a(p,q)  and  the  quantum  operators  a.  Beyond  the 
trivial  zero order  stage  in  ~, problem  ~3 can  (with respect  to  0q) only 
have  an  observational  meaning  M ~   as  a  guiding  principle  for  de- 
tecting  the  appropriate  form  of the  quantum  operators  (i.e.  as  pro- 
blem  ~,).  A  formal  solution  of  problem  ~3  has  been  proposed  b y  
W  e  y  1 3) (cf. 4.03). We incidentally come back to problem ~3 in  1.18. 
1.10  Quantum  observables.  In  this  section  a  will not  denote  a  clas- 
sical quantity  a(p,q), but  it will stand  as a symbol for the  observable, 
which  (with regard  to  Oq) is represented  b y  the  quantum  operator  a. 
According to  Oq two or more observables a,  b . . . . .   can  be simultane- 
ously  measured  or  not,  according  as  the  corresponding  operators 
a,  b , . . . ,  
respectively  do  or  do  not  commute  i.e.  as  they  have  all 
eigenstates in common or not.  Problem a4 deals with the  (one-to-one) 
correspondence  a  ~  > a  between the  symbols a  and  the  operators  a. 
Problem ~4 has no sense  as long  as the  symbols a  are undefined.  They 
may,  however,  be implicitely  defined just  b y   putting  a  rule  of  cor- 
respondence.  (When  the  symbols  a  are  identified  ~vith  the  classical 
quantities  a(p,q),  problem  a4  becomes  identical  with  problem  a3). 
V  o  n  N  e  u  m  a  n  n  1) has  proposed  the  rules 

i f a ~ a ,  

then/(a)  <  ~/(a), 

if a  +--~  a  and  b  <  ~  b,  then  a  +  b  <  > a  +  b. 

I 

II 

/(a)  is  defined  as  the  operator,  which  has  the  same  eigenstates  as  a 
with  eigenvalues/(a~,),  where  a~, are  those  of  a.  Then  I  seems  to  be 
obvious.  The  observable/(a)  can  be  measured  simultaneously  with

', 

a,  its  value :is/(a~,),  where  a~ is  t h a t  of a.  When • a  and  b  commute, 
a  +  b  has the same eigenstates as a  and b  with eigenvatues a~  +  b w 
where  a~, and  b~ are  those  of a  and  b.  Then  II  seems a l s o t o   be  ob- 
vious, a  +  b can be  measured simultaneously with a  and b, its value 
is a~, +  b w  where a~ and b~ are the values of a  and  b. When  a  and  b 
do not  commute,  I I   is proposed  with  some  hesitation.  Because  ac- 
cording.to 0q the probability of finding a value a~, for a in a state k  is 
T r ( k k ~ )   (and  because  of  1.20)),  the  expectation  value  (average 
value)  of a  in  this  state  i s  

•  Ex(a) 

E  Tr(kk~,~)a~,=  Tr(ka)

and similar for b. If one requires t h a t  for a certain pair of observables 
a  and  b  always 

Ex(a  +  b)  =  Ex(a)  +  Ex(b), 

one must, because of 

have t h a t  

Tr(k(a  + b ) )   ----- Tr(ka)  +  Tr(kb), 

Ex(a  +  b)  ----Tr(k(a  +  b)). 

(1.32) 

(1.33) 

(1.34) 

Because this has to hold for all states k, a  and b have to  satisfy rule 
II,  When  II  is  given  up  for certain  pairs a,b,  the  additivity of  the 
expectation values of these pairs has also to be given up. 

In  4.01  it  will be  shown  t h a L   if I  and  II  shall be generally valid, 
the symbols a  have  to he isomorphic with the operators a.  But  then 
there  is  no  reason  to  introduce  the  former,  their  task  (if  any)  can 
be  left  to  the  latter.  Accordingly  for  the  sake  of b r e v i t y   we  shall 
henceforth speak  of.the (quantum)  observable  a. 

When on the  other hand,  the symbols a  are  intended as real com- 
muting quantities, the  general  validity of  I  and  n  cannot be  main- 
tained,  As  long  as ,the  symbols  a  are  not  further  defined,  problem 
0~  comes  to  searching  for  a  one-to-one  correspondence  a . <   ~ a 
between  the  commutative ring  of real  symbols a  and .the  non-com~ 
mutative ring of H  e r m i t  i a n  operators a. There m a y  be no, one or 
more  solutions.  After  the  pleas  for  I  and  for  I!,  one  might  be  in- 
clined to  maintain  1 and  to  restrict  II.  In  1.13 we  meet  with  a  par- 
ticular case (problem ~s) for which II has to be maintained and there- 
fore  I  has  to  be  restricted.  Because  we  are  further  exclusively in- 
terested in  problem  ~ ,   we  will not  examine  the  possibility of  solu- 
tions  for  which  n 

is  restricted.

1.11 Hidden  parameters.  We  try  to  trace  the  conditions  for  the 
assumption  that  the  statistical  description of quantum  mechanics is 
(at  least  formally)  of.the  1st  kind  S i  (problem  ~).  A  statistical  des- 
cription  S 1 must  be  obtained  by  statistical  averaging  over uniquely 
determined  processes.  The  averaging  must  be  described  by  inte- 
gration  or summation  over  a  statistical  distribution  with  respect  to 
certain  parameters.  Unless they  are  further specified, we denote  all 
parameters  by  a  single  symbol  ~ and  integration  (including  a  pos- 
sible density function) and  summation over continuous and  discrete 
parameters b y f  d~. Parameters, which are in no way observable with 
respect  to  0 v  are  called  hidden  parameters.  (We  exclude  their  oc- 
curence  in  1.15).  As a pure superstate we define a state for which all 
parameters  (inclusive  the  hidden  ones)  have  a  definite  value. 

1.12 Distributions.  A  quantum  state  must  be  described  as  an  en- 
semble  of  pure  superstates.  The  statistical  operator  k  of  the  quan- 
tum  state  must  correspond  to  at  least  one  (non-negative  definite) 
distribution  function  k(~)  for  the  superstates.  For  each  definite 
value  of  ~  all  k(~) must  have  definite  values  and  therefore  must 
commute, k(~) must be normalized by f  d~ k(~) =  1, so that with (1.23) 

Trk  =  f  d~ k(~). 

(1.35) 

Further  the  correspondence  must  be  linear 

if kl  + - ~   kl(~)  and k2 ~  ~ k2(~), then kt  +  k2<  ~ kt(~)+k2(~).  (1.36) 

The  observable  (with respect  to  Oq) represented by  the  statistical 
operator  kin, of a  pure  quantum  state  has  the  eigenvalue  1 in  this 
quantum  state  and  0  in  all  orthogonal  states.  The  probability  of 
measuring  in  a  system,  which  is  originally  in  a  quantum  state  k, 
the value  1 (and leaving the  system in the  pure  quantum  state  k~,~,) 
is  Tr(kkm, ).  In  a  description  of type  S t this  probability  must  be  in- 
terpreted  as  the  probability  that  any  superstate  belonging  to  the 
ensemble  with  distribution  function  k(~)  corresponding  to  k  also 
belongs  to  the  ensemble  with  distribution  function  km,(~ )  corres- 
ponding  to  kin,.  The  latter  probability  is fd~  k(~)km,(~ ). Therefore 
the  correspondence k  +--+  k(~)  must  be  so  that  always 

Tr(ktk2)  ~  f  d~ kt(~)k2(~). 

(1.37) 

For  two  orthogonal  states  kt  and  k~ this  expression  is  zero,  which 
guarantees  that  the  distribution  functions  kl(~)  and  k2(~) do  not 
overlap, provided they are non-negative definite.

1.13  Superquantities.  The  expectation  value  of  the  observable  a 

in  the  q u a n t u m   state  k  is because  of  (1.31)  and  (1.37) 

Tr(kkt,~,)a~, =  ~ f  d~ k(~)k~,~,(~)a~,.

(1.38) 

The  right  h a n d   member  of  (1.38)  can  be  interpreted  as  the  average 
value  of a  q u a n t i t y   a(~)  ----- X a~,kt,~,(~ )  (defined  as the  s u p e r q u a n t i t y  

P 

corresponding  to  the  observable  a)  in  the  ensemble  of  superstates 
with  distribution  function  k(~).  This is exactly the  w a y  in  which  the 
expectation  value  should  appear  in  a  description  of  t y p e   S 1.  Thus 
with the  correspondence  a  + - ~   a(~)  (which is a  linear generalization 
of k  <  > k(~))  the  expectation  value  of a  in  the  state  k  can  be  writ- 
ten 

Tr(ka)  =  f  d~ k(~)  a(~). 

(1.39) 

Comparison  with  (1.35~ shows  t h a t   the  unit  operator  1  has  to  cor- 
respond  to  the  unit  q u a n t i t y   1

B y   a  further  linear  generalization  of  (1.39)  we  see  t h a t   the  cor- 

respondence  a  (  > a(~)  m u s t   obey  the  rule 

if a  +--+  a(~)  and  b  ~  >  b(~),  then  Tr(ab)  -~ fd~ a(~) b(~).  IV 

Rule  I I   is  a  consequence  of  rule  IV  (the  necessity  of  II  is  evident 
from  the  beginning,  because  average  of  sum  ~  sum  of  averages). 
Therefore  rule  I  cannot  be satisfied w i t h o u t  restrictions. 

Problem  c~ 5 is  how  to  establish  the  correspondence  a  <  ~  a(~). 

~-5 is, like a3,  a  special  case  of ~4. 

1.14 Equations  o/motion.  The  equations  of  motion  for  the  quan- 
t u m   states  must  be  obtained  from  the  equations  of  motion  for  the 
superstates.  The  former  are  determined  b y   the  H  a  m  i 1 t  o n  i a  n 
operator  H  (which  m a y   depend  on  time t)  of the  system  according 
to  the  equation  of  motion  of  the  statistical  operator  k

sion  a,b 
is  written  ((a(4), b(4)))  (the  former and  consequently also 
the  latter  bracket  expression  is  antisymmetrical),  the  equation  of

The  equations  of motion  for the  hidden  parameters  m a y  be of a  dif- 
ferent  form.  When  all  parameters  (inclusive  the  hidden  ones)  are 
continuous,  their  equations  of  motion  have  to  satisfy  the  condition

(where the last  term  stands  symbolically for a  sum  over  all  separate

We  m a y   summarize  that,  in  order  to  give  a  statistical  description 
of  the  1st  kind,  one  would  have  to  determine  (only  formally  for 
type S~,  also experimentally  for type  So 1) the  parameters  ~ (inclusive 
the hidden  ones) and  the  density function,  the  (one-to-one or one-to- 
many)  correspondence  a  <  +  a(~)  (problem  ~5)  and  the  equations 
of  motion  for  the  hidden  parameters  (if  there  are  any  such),  all 
with regard  to  the imposed conditions. 

1.15  Correspondence  a  +--+  a(~).  Because  a  n o n - H e r m i t i a n  
operator a  (with adjoint  a*)  can  be written  as  a  complex linear  com- 
bination  of  H  e r m  i t  i a n  operators 

1 
a  =  ½(a  +  a*)  +  7 

( i a - - i a * ) ,  

the  generalization  of  the  correspondence  a  <  ~  a(~)  to  non-I-  e r- 
m  i t  i a n  operators is uniquely determined.  Now take the  non-H  e r- 
m  i t  i a n  transition  operators  k~v, which  according  to  (1.13),  (1.14) 
form  a  complete  orthonormal  system  in  the  ring  of  operators  a. 
For  the  corresponding  functions  k~v(~)  we  get  corresponding  to 
(1.11),  (1.12);  (1.13),  (1.14)  and  (1.15)  (and  using  III,  IV and  (1.03)) 
the  relations 

f  d~ kzv(~ )  =  ~t,v,

(the  ~v~  are  the  same  as  in  (1.15)).  These  relations  show,  that  the 
functions  a(~)  can  be  regarded  as  elements  of  a 
(generalized) 
H  i 1 b  e r  t  space,  in  which  the  km(~ )  form  a  complete  orthonormal 
system;  (1.52) expresses the  orthonormality,  (1.53)  the  completeness. 
We  now  show  t h a t   the  correspondence  a  ~  >  a(~)  has  to  be  a 
one-to-one  correspondence.  Suppose  for  a  m o m e n t   there  are  opera- 
tors  k~v to  which  there  correspond  more  than  one  functions  km(~), 
which  we  distinguish  b y   an  index  p,  k ~   <  > kin; p(~).  Then  the  ex- 
pression 

g  fd~  k~;p(~)  k~,v,;V(~ )  k~,,¢; p,,(~') 
H/W" 
evaluated  with  (1.52)  gives  kj,v;K'(~'), evaluated  with  (1.53)  it  gives 
k~,;p(~').  Therefore  k~,~; p,,(~') and  k~,,; p(~')  have  to  be  identical.  To 
each  operator  a  and  only  to  this  one there  has  to  correspond  one  and 
only  one  s u p e r q u a n t i t y   a(~).  As  a  consequence  the  superquantities 
a(~)  must  depend  on  the  same  n u m b e r   of  parameters  (at  least  if 
t h e y   are  not  too  bizarre)  as  the  operators  a,  i.e.  on  twice  as  m a n y   as 
the  wave  functions  ~0. 

Thus  to  each  (normalizable)  real  function  a(~)  and  only  to  this  one 
there  corresponds  one  and  only one  H  e r  m  i t  i a  n  operator  a,  which 
(with  respect  to  Oq). In  other 
represents  an  observable  q u a n t i t y  
words  every  real  function  a(~)  is  a  superquantity.  Because  this  also 
holds  for  the  (real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the)  parameters  ~ them- 
selves,  none  of  t h e m   can  be  hidden  in  the  sense  defined  above.  (An 
observable  q u a n t i t y   m a y   occasionally  be  inobservable  in  a  measur- 
ing  device  adepted  to  an  incommensurable  q u a n t i t y ;   in  this  sense  a 
parameter  m a y   occasionally  be hidden).  In  particular  all parameters 
must  o b e y   (1.48).

(1.60)  is  equivalent  to 

fd~ m(~)  Tr(m(~)  a)  =  a  (for every a). 
(1.59)  expresses that  m(~)  is orthonormal with  respect  to  the  ring  of 
operators  a,  complete  with  respect  to  the  ring  of  superquantities 
a(~);  (1.60)  expresses  the  crossed  properties. 

If,  on  the  other  hand,  a  H  e r  m  i t  i a  n  transformation  nucleus 
m(~)  satisfies  the  conditions  (1.57),  (1.58) ;  (1.59),  (1.60),  the  corres- 
pondence  (1.55)  satisfies  III  and  IV.  We  m a y   either  choose  a  com- 
plete  orthonormal  system  of  kt, v,  satisfying  (1.11),  (1.12);  (1.13), 
( I. 14)  and  determine  the corresponding system of k~,v(~), which then 
satisfy  (1.50),  (1.51);  (1.52),  (1.53),  or  we  choose the  latter  system 
and  determine  the  former one.  In  both  cases  m(~)  can  be  expanded 
according  to  (1.56). 

1.16  Uniqueness. Now  let  us  see  whether  the  correspondence 
a  <  >  a(~)  is  uniquely  determined  by  the  conditions  I I I   and  IV. 
Suppose  we  have  two  different  nuclei  m'(~)  and  rn"(~),  depending 
on  the  same  parameter  ~  and  both  satisfying  (1.57),  (1.58);  (1.59), 
(1.60).  When  we  choose  for  both  the  same  complete  orthonormal 
system  of  k~v(~) satisfying  (1.50),  (1.51);  (1.52),  (1.53),  we  find  two 
corresponding  systems  of  k ~   and  k~,v, which  each  .satisfy  (1.11), 
(1.12);(1.13),  (1.14).  Therefore  the  latter  systems  can  be  connected 
by  a  unitary  transformation 

k~, v  =  u k ~ v   u t,  u u   t  = 

1 ;  k ; ~   : 

u t k ~   u 

(1.61) 

(expressed  analoguous  to  (1.03)  u  can  be  written  as  E  ~?~ q0~t). The 

l 

same  unitary  transformation  connects  the  nuclei  m'(~)  and  m"(~) 
and  also  the  statistical  operators  k'  and  k "   corresponding  to  the 
same  distribution  function  k(~)  and  the  operators  a'  and  a "   cor- 
responding  to  the  same  superquantity  a(~).  Then  the  single  and 
double  dashed  representations  are  isomorphous  and  in  q u a n t u m  
mechanics  regarded  as  equivalent.  Therefore,  when  the  parameters 
have  been  chosen,  the  correspondence  a  <  > a(~)  (if  there  is  any 

correspondence)  can  be  considered  as  unique. 

When  we choose one  set  of parameters  ~ and  another  set  of  para- 
meters  ~,  the  nuclei  m(~)  and  m(~)  (if  there  are  any  nuclei)  can  be 
considered as uniquely determined.  When  we take  a  complete ortho-

(I .50),  (1.51);  (1.52),  (1.53).  Then  it  follows that  the  superquantities 
a'(~)  and  a"(~),  corresponding to  the  same  operator  a  are  connected 
by 

a'(~) = f d B   v(~;  ~)a"(~);  a"(B)  = f a t   v(~;~)a'(~),

(1.64)

The  rings  of  a'(~) and  of  a"(~)  are  not  necessarily  isomorphous.

This  shows  that  the  transformation  between  two  isomorphous  re- 
presentations  a'(~)  and  a"(~)  can be regarded  as merely a transform- 
ation  of  the  parameters.  It  further  follows  that,  if  the  dynamical 
conditions  for  (1.49)  are  fulfilled  by  one  of  these  representations, 
they  are  also  fulfilled  by  the  other  one.  Therefore  isomorphous  re- 
presentations  can  be  regarded  as  equivalent.

(1.70),  the  representations  a'(~)  and  a"(~)  are  non-isomorphous. 

1.17  Parameters. 

In  4.03  we  derive  a  correspondence,  satisfying 
n I   and  IV,  in  which  the  two  independent  parameters  (denoted  b y  
p  and  q),  which  run  continuously  between  m  co  and  +  co,  corres- 
pond to the operators  p  and  q. This choice of parameters  might  seem 
the  most  satisfactory  one,  as  it  is  adapted  to  the  fundamental  part 
played b y  the  momentum  and  the  coordinate.  (By the  way,  because 
momentum  and  coordinate  cannot  simultaneously  be  measured,  p 
m a y   be  regarded  as  occasionally  hidden  in  a  coordinate  measure- 
ment,  q similarly  in  a  momentum  measurement  - -   or in  a  somewhat 
different  conception  p  m a y   be  regarded  as  occasionally  hidden  in 
q-representation,  q in  p-representation  ; both p  and  q m a y  be regard- 
ed  as  occasionally  partially  hidden  in  other  measurements  or  re- 
presentations). 

In  1.16  we have  seen that  for each  choice of a  complete  orthonor- 
mal  system  of  kw(p,q),  satisfying  (1.50),  (1.51);  (1.52),  (1.53),  there 
must  for every other  representation  with  parameters  ~  be a similar 
system  of  k~,,(~) with  the  same  set  of indices  Vt,v. That  makes  us ex- 
pect that  when  ~ stands  for a  set  of not  too bizarre  continuous  para- 
meters, the latter  can like p  and q be represented  b y  two independent 
real  parameters  r  and  s.  We  do  not  examine  the  validity  of this  ex- 
pectation  (which  would  be  very  difficult). 

1.18  Bracket  expressions.  When  these  parameters  r  and  s  are  also 
independent  of  time,  the  consistency  relation  for  (1.47),  (1.48)  and 
(1.49)  reads 

((H(r,s)  a(r,s)))  --  Oa(r,s)  ((H(r,s)

For  the  superquantities  p(r;s)  and  q(r,s)  corresponding  to  p  and  q 
we  get  because  of  (1.30) 

((p(r,s),  q(r,s)))  ---- ((r,s))  (p(r,s),  q(r,s))  =  I. 

(1.76) 

Therefore  (1.74)  can  also  be  written 

( (a(r,s),  b(r,s)))  =  (p(r,s) , q(r,s) ) " 

(a(r,s) ,  b(r,s) )

This  means  that  the  correspondence  a  ~  > a(r,s)  has  to  satisfy the 
rule

The  analoguous  derivation  for  the  parameters  p  and  q  gives 
(independent  of  our  unproved  expectation  about  the  parameters 
r  and  s) the  condition 

if  a  +--+  a(p,q)  and b  ~ 

.~ b(p,q),  then  a,b 

<  >  (a(p,q),  b(p,q)).  V, 

For  this  choice  of  parameters  problem  as  of  the  correspondence 
between  the  superquantities  a(p,q)  and  the  quantum  operators  a 
seems very similar  to  problem  ~3 of the  correspondence  between  the 
classical  quantities  a(p,q)  and  the  quantum  operators  a,  b y   which 
they  are  replaced  in  the  procedure  of quantization.  The  fact  that  in 
this procedure the  P  o i s s o n  brackets in the equations of motion are 
replaced  b y   operator  brackets  might  suggest  rule  V'  in  problem  ~3. 
If a  solution  of a3 satisfying rules  III,  IV  and  V'  could be found,  the 
classical  description  could be regarded  as the  description  of the  uni- 
quely  determined  processes  in  a  statistical  description  of  the  1st 
kind  S 1. The  utopian  notion  0u, intended  to  proclai.m these processes 
as observable, would coincide with the classical notion  Oc. This would 
not  (as it  might  seem)  exactly mean  a  return  towards  the  old classi- 
cal  theory,  which  was  regarded  as incorrect  (with  respect  to  0q and 
therefore  also  with  respect  to  0u,  which  regards  0q  as  correct, 
though  incomplete),  because  one  would  have  to  deal  with  peculiar 
distributions  of classical systems.  These  distributions  would have  to 
be  responsible  for  quantization. 

But  such  a  solution  cannot  be  found.  In  4.02  we  show  that  V'  is 
self  contradictory  (except  for  lim  h -+  0).  Because  V'  already  fails 

424 

H.J.  GROENEWOLD 

for operators  of occuring  types,  a  restriction  of the  admitted  opera- 
tors  could not  help.  Therefore  a  solution  of problem  as with  p  and  q 
as  parameters,  which  satisfies  the  dynamical  conditions,  is  impos- 
sible, just  as a  solution of ~3, which  describes the  quantization  of  the 
classical equations  of motion  b y  the  same rule  as the  quantization  of 
the  classical  observables. 

This  is in  point  of fact  all  we  have  been  able  to  prove.  Though  p 
and  q  maY  seem  the  most  satisfactory  choice  of  parameters  in  a 
description  of  type  S 1,  the  formal  disproof  of  just  this  description 
does  not  involve  the  impossibility  of  any  description  of  type  SJ.  A 
complete proof of the impossibility of a description of type S~ does not 
seem simple  and  neither  does the  construction  of such  a  description. 
For  a  pair  of  continuous  time  independent  parameters  r  and  s 
condition  V  would  have  to  be  satisfied.  When  the  commutator  of 
r  and  s  commutes  with  r  and  s,  V  is  self  contradictory  just  like  V'. 
It  is  doubtful  whether  V  can  be  consistent  in  other  cases.  A  pair  of 
continuous  time  dependent  parameters  r(t)  and  s(t)  must  at  every 
time t be unique  single-valued functions of the initial  values r(to)  and 
s(to)  at  an  arbitrary  time  to. Then  instead  of the  time  dependent  r(t) 
and  s(t)  the  time  independent  r(to)  and  s(to)  can  serve  as parameters. 
Therefore,  if  our  expectation  about  continuous  parameters  is  justi- 
fied, the  difficulty for such parameters  lies mainly in the consistency 
of V.  It  is  difficult  to  see  how  parameters  with  entirely  or  partially 
discrete  values  or  of too  bizarre  continuous  type  could  give  a  satis- 
factory description  of type  S 1. 

There  are  still  more  difficulties  for  a  description  S I as  we will see 

in  a  moment. 

1.19  Quasi-statistical  description.  Whereas  it  is  doubtful  whether 
the dynamical condition  V can be fulfilled, conditions  III  and  IV can 
be  satisfied  without  much  difficulties.  With  a  solution  of  the  latter 
conditions  only,  one  can  construct  a  quasi-statistical  description  of 
the  1st  kind  Q~,  which  looks  very  similar  to  a  formal  statistical 
description  of  the  1st  kind  S~,  but  in  general  does  not  satisfy  the 
dynamical  (and,  as  we  will  see  in  a  moment,  other  necessary)  con- 
ditions.  A solution of I I I   and  IV gives according  to  (1.39) the  correct 
average values. But  the real distribution  function k(~)  corresponding 
to  a  H  e r m  i t  i a n  non-negative  definite  statistical  operator  k  of a 
quantum  state  (pure state or mixture)  is in general not  non-negative 
definite. 

ON  THE  PRINCIPLES  OF  ELEMENTARY  QUANTUM  MECHANICS  42t~ 

The difficulty of interpreting negative probabilities might perhaps 
be  surmountable,  at  least in  formal sense M 1. Meanwhile, according 
to  the  remark  following  (1.37),  it  is  no  longer  guaranteed,  that  the 
distribution  functions  ki(~)  and  k2(~) corresponding  to  orthogonal 
quantum  states  k  t  and  k2 do  not  overlap.  And  overlapping  of such 
distribution  functions  it  not  allowed  by  the  notion  of  quantum  ob- 
servability 0 v  We see this in the following way.  Suppose  we subject 
the  system  repeatedly  to  a  measurement,  which  distinguishes  be- 
tween the states  k t and  k2 (and other orthogonal states). When  after 
one  measurement  the  system  is  left  in  the  state  kl,  the  probability 
of  finding  it  after  a  repeated  measurement  in  the  state  k2  is  0 
because  of  (1.37).  In  the  quantum  mechanical  interpretation  this 
means  absolute  certainty  of  not  finding  the  state  k2.  In  the  quasi- 
statistical  interpretation  the  zero  value  for  the  right  hand  member 
of (1.37)  results from integration  of positive  and  negative probabili- 
ties  over  the  region  of  overlapping.  Integration  over  a  statistical 
distribution  refers to  a  great  number  of measurements.  In  a  proper 
statistical  description of the  1 st kind S l the absolute certainty of not 
finding the state  k2, even in  a  single measurement, can only be esta- 
blished if no superstate occurring in the ensemble kl(~) can also occur 
in  the ensemble k2(~), i.e. if k1(4) and k2(~) do not  overlap. 

Therefore in  order to  find a  statistical  description  of type S},  one 
would have  to  satisfy not  only conditions  II,  IV  and  V  (or another 
dynamical  condition),  but  also  the  condition  that  the  distribution 
functions  of  quantum  states  are  non-negative  definite,  or  at  least 
that  the  distribution  functions  of orthogonal  states  do  not  overlap. 
This  task  does  not  look  very promizing. 

We  incidentally  remark  that  in  any  representation  of  type  QI 
either of the  two  parameters  can be  treated  as  occasionally hidden. 
Already after integration  over this  one  parameter  we get  the  quan- 
tum  mechanical formalism in  the  representation  of the  other  para- 
meter.  In  particular no negative probabilities  are left. 

In 4.03 we derive a  particular solution  (W e y  l's  correspondence) 
of III  and IV with  parameters p  and q and in  5 we discuss the quasi- 
statistical  description QI to  which it leads.  We do so not  only for the 
sake  of  curiosity,  but  also  because  it  is  very  instructive  to  those 
opponents  in  the  fundamental controversy, who  have  a  description 
of type S l  (similar to  that  of classical statistical  mechanics) vaguely 
in  mind.  A  description  of  type  Q1  might  be  the  utmost  (though 

4 2 6  

H . J .   G R O E N E W O L D  

rather  poor)  realization  of such  foggy ideas.  (The  mysterious hidden 
parameters  then  turn  out  as  ordinary,  occasionally  inobservable- 
observables).  Such  a  description  clearly  shows  the  obstacles  (equa, 
tions  of  motion;  non-negative  probabilities  or  non-overlapping 
distributions)  at  which  all  such  conceptions  m a y   be  expected  to 
break  down. 

So  far  the  general  line  of  reasoning.  Before  dealing  further  with 
correspondence  in  4,  for  which  we  need  the  operator  relations  of  3, 
we  review  in  2  the  measuring  process  in  terms  of  the  operator  re- 
presentation.

2.01  Deviation.  Quite  apart  from  the  interpretation  of  1.10,  the 
expectation  value  of a  quantum  observable  a  in  a  quantum  state  k 
is  given  b y   (1.31)  or 

Ex(k;  a)  =  Tr(ka). 

(2.01) 

Further  the  deviation  of  this  observable  in  this  state  is  defined  by 

Dev(k;  a)  =  E x ( k ;   (a - -   1Ex(k;  a)) 2) =  Tr(k(a  - -   1Tr(ka)) 2) ----- 

---- Tr(ka 2) - -   (Tr(ka)) 2. 

(2.02) 

First  we  review  some  consequences  of  this  definition,  detached  of 
any  interpretation. 

It  can be seen from the inner  members  of  (2.02) that  the  deviation 
is  non-negative.  We  form  the  transition  operators  kv~ ,  (1.03)  of  the 
complete  system  of  eigenfunctions  ~0~  of  a  with  eigenvalues  a~, 
and  expand  k  according  to  (1.15)  as 

k  =  ~  x~, k m with  xv~ =  Tr(kv~ , k).

The  normalization  of  k  (Trk  =  1)  gives  with  (1.11)

If  k  is  a  pure  state  with  wave  function  %  we  have

(2.06) 

× ~   is then  non-negative  and  (2.05)  can  only  be  zero,  if ~0 is  a  linear 
combination  of  eigenfunctions  %,  all  with  the  same  eigenvalue  a t,

If  the  normalized  q u a n t u m   state  k  (pure  state  or  mixture)  can  be 
written  as  a  mixture  of  other  normalized  states  k,  with  weights  k ,

(2.02)  gives

The deviation of a in the state k  is therefore  only zero, if all occuring 
states  k, (k,  >  0)  in  the  mixture  give  zero  deviation  and  the  same 
expectation  value  for  a.  Taking  for  the  k,  pure  states  (the  eigen- 
states  of k),  we see t h a t   a  is only deviationless in the  state  k,  if the 
latter  is  a  pure  linear  combinatiofl or  a  mixture  of  linear  combina- 
tions of eigenstates of a  all with the  same eigenvalue. 

Because  one  can  easily find two  non-degenerate quantum  opera- 
tors  (i.e.  q u a n t u m   operators  with  no  more  than  one  eigenstate  f6r 
each eigenvalue), which have  no  eigenstates in  common  (e.g.  p  and 
q),  there  can  be  no  q u a n t u m   states  in  which  all  observables  have 
zero  deviation  (deviationless  states)  1).  Here  might  seem  to  lie  the 
reason  why  the  observational  statements  of  quantum  mechanics 
are  in  general  of statistical  character.  No  doubt  there  is  some  con- 
nection,  but  this  rapid  conclusion  should  not  be  taken  too  rashly, 
because  it  implies  an  interpretation  of  the  deviation,  which  is  not 
entirely justified. Let  us  turn  to  this  interpretation. 

In  a  statistical  description  of  the  1st  kind  S 1 the  deviation  of  a 

q u a n t i t y   a  is  defined  by 

Dev(a)  ----- Ex((a  - -   Ex(a)) 2)  =  Ex(a 2) - -   (Ex(a)) 2. 

(2.09) 

In  an  ensemble,  in  which  this  deviation  is  zero,  a  must  have  the 
same value in all samples. Then it follows that for every function/(a) 

Ex(/(a))  = / ( E x ( a ) ) .  

(2.10) 

Whereas  in general a  has  a  proper  value only in  a  sample  and in  an 
ensemble  only an  average  value  (expectation  value),  one  can  speak 
of the proper value of a  in an  ensemble if the  deviation is zero. 

In  quantum  mechanics  it  is  not  entirely clear  what  is  meant  by 
the square  or another function of an  observable.  In order to  discuss 
things, let  us  have  recourse  for  a  moment  to  the  notion of  1.10 and 
let  a  stand  for  the  observable  represented  by  a(a  <  •  a;  problem 
~4).  Then  (2.09)  is  only  identical  with  (2.02)  for  all  states  k  if 

428 

H.J.  GROENEWOLD 

a 2 +--+  a 2.  Further  we  have  seen  that  a  state  k,  in  which  (2.02)  is 
zero, must  be a  (mixture  of) linear  combination(s)  of eigenstates of a 
all  with  the  same  eigenvalue  a~.  In  these  states  the  eigenvalue  of 
/(a)  is/(a~,)  and  Dev(k;/(a))  =  0.  We  write  the  operator,  which  re- 
presents/(a)  as  f(a).  If  (2.10)  shall  be  valid  in  a  state  k,  in  which 
(2.02)  is zero,  we must  have 

Tr(kf(a))  =/(Tr(ka))  =  (a~,)  =  Tr(k  /Ca));  Dev(k;  f(a))  =  0.  (2.11) 

The  second  part  is  a  special  case  of the  first.  The  first  part  requires 
that  the  matrix  elements  of f(a)  with  respect  to  the  eigenstates  of a 
with  the  same  eigenvalue  a~  have  to  be  the  same  as  those  of  (a) 
(i.e.  equal  to/(a~,)),  the  second  part  that  the  matrix  elements  of f(a) 
with  respect  to  the  eigenstates  of  a  with  different  eigenvalues  a~, 
are  zero  like  those  o f / ( a ) .   This  means  f(a)  -----/(a)  so  that  I  has  to 
be satisfied.  For every a, for which I  is  accepted,  (2.10)  always  holds 
in  states  in  which  a  has  zero  deviation.  For  those  a,  for  which  I  is 
rejected,  (2.10)  breaks  down  even  in  such  states.  In  the  latter 
case it should be kept in mind that  if we speak about a~, as the proper 
value  of  the  observable  a  in  such  a  state,  this  is  actually  more  or 
less misleading. 

Thus we could give a meaning  to the  deviation,  as soon as we could 
give  a  meaning  to  problem  ~4 (or the  special  case  ~(5). This  meaning 
would  only  agree  with  the  one  which  is  usually  prematurely  ac- 
cepted,  as  long  as  rule  I  would hold.  From  the  quantummechanical 
point  of  view  Oq there  is  no  need  for  such  a  meaning.  Meanwhile 
from the formal point  of view the definiteness of the expression  (2.02) 
remains  of interest. 

2.02  The  measuring  device 1).  The  aim  of  an  (ideal)  measuring 
process is to infer  (the most complete)  data  of the object system from 
the  data  of  the  observational  perception.  Object  system  and  ob- 
server  interact  b y   intervention  of  a  chain  of  systems,  which  form 
the  measuring  instrument.  This  chain  can  be  cut  into  two  parts. 
The  first  part  (which  m a y   be  empty)  can  be  added  to  the  object 
system,  the  last  part  to  the  observer.  Extended  object  system  and 
extended  observer  interact  directly.  The  (extended)  object  system 
is regarded  as  a  physical system.  It  is described b y  a  physical treat- 
ment.  The  (extended)  observer  is  unsusceptible  of  a  physical  treat- 
ment.  Its  part  consists  in  an  act,  which  must  be  stated  without 
further  analysis.  The  result  of  the  measuring  process  should  be  in-

dependent  of the  place  of the  cut  in  the  measuring  system,  provided 
the  first  part  is entirely  accessible  to  a  physical  treatment. 

We  make  a  simplified  model  of  the  extended  object  system  in 
which  all partaking  systems  have  one  degree  of freedom.  The  original 
object  system  is .denoted  b y   1, the  successive  systems  of the  measur- 
ing  instrument  before  the  cut  b y   2,3 . . . . .   n.  E v e r y   pair  of  adjacent 
systems  l  - -   1 and  l  (l  =  2 , 3 , . . . .   n)  is coupled  during  a  time  interval 
(t~__4, t~__~). The  time  intervals  must  be  ordered  so,  t h a t  

t2k+t  >  t2k--l. 

(2.12) 

For  the  sake  of simplicity  we impose  the  condition  that  different  time 
intervals  do  not  overlap 

tk >  tk--1. 

(2.13) 

Then  the  couplings  between  the  various  pairs  of  adjacent  systems 
can  successively  be  treated  separately. 

In  1 we choose  a complete  system  of  orthonormal  wave  functions 
10# (t).  The  time  dependence  can  be  described  with  the  help  of  a 
H  e r  m  i t  i a  n  operator  H°(t)  according  to 

~ a  
i  at  ?;t~(t) =  H°(t)?;t'(t)" 

(2.14) 

1 is  coupled  with  2  during  the  time  interval  (to,/l).  This  means  that 
during  this  time  interval  the  H  a  m  i 1 t  o n  i a  n  Hi2(t )  of  the  com- 
bined  systems  1  and  2  cannot  be  split  up  into  the  sum  of  two 
H  a  m  i 1 t  o  n  i a  n  s  H,(¢)  and  H2(t)  of  the  separate  systems.  The 
system  2 is supposed  to be  initially  in  the  pure  q u a n t u m   state  ?2o(to). 
We  impose  two  conditions  on  H12(t) and  ?20(to).  The  first  condition 
is  that  H12(t ) - -   H°(t)  must  be  diagonal  with  respect  to  the  system 
of 

(Hl2(t)  - -   H°(t))?,(t)  =.  ?~t,(t)G~2(t).

Gta  is an  operator  with  respect  to  the  variables  of 2  (q-number),  but

W h e n   1  is  initially  in  the  pure  q u a n t u m   state  ?;t,(to),  the  final 

state  of  1 and  2  together  is  because  of  the  wave  equation

(2.27)  is the statistical  operator of a  mixture of pure  quantum  states 
q~a~ (t)~,~, (t)... ~0~, (t)  with  weights  xlv~ (to).  The  ignorance  of  the 
correlation  with  other  systems has  also  partially  destroyed the  cor- 
relation  between the  selected systems themselves.  According to  the 
remaining  correlation  only  individual  pure  quantum  states  q%,(t) 
of the systems l 1, l 2 . . . .  l, with the  same Greek index occur together. 
We  denote  a  state  of  a  group  of  systems,  which  has  come  about 
by interaction with other,  afterwards ignored, system.s as an infring- 
ed  state.  ((2.25)  is the  entangled state  (2.27)  the  infringed state). 

We  consider two  particular  cases of infringed states.  First  we put 
m  =  n  and let the selected series consist of the systems  1 and n  only. 
(2.27)  then  becomes 

kl,(t )  =  X; ×lm,(to)klm,(t)k.m,(t) 

(t  >/t2,~_3 ). 

(2.28) 

P 

The correlation between  1 and n,  which is left in this infringed state, 
justifies  the  inference  that  when  for  n  the  pure  quantum  state 
~.~(t)  is realized,  the  corresponding pure  quantum  state  V l~,(t) (with 

4,32 

H.  J.  GROENEWOLD 

the  same  ~)  is  realized  for  1.  With  this  inference  the  correlation  is 
completely  exhausted. 

In  the  second  place  we  put  m  =  n  +  1 (supposing  that  the  inter- 
action  between  n  and  n  +  1, which  crosses the  cut,  is still  accessible 
to a  physical treatment)  and  select the  systems  1,2 . . . .   n.  Then  (2.27) 
gives 

klz..,(t)  =  l~ ×lm,(to)k,~,(t)k2,~(t)...k,m,(t  )  (t >  t2,-l). 

(2.29) 

(2.29)  determines  the  infringed  state  in  which  the  extended  object 
system  is left  after  the  interaction  with  the  observer,  if the  state  of 
the  observer is  afterwards  ignored. 

If  in  (2.29)  we  put  n  =  1,  we  get 

kl(t )  =  X  xlm~(t0)kl##(t) 

t~ 

(t  />  tl), 

(2.30) 

which determines  the infringed  state of the original  object system af- 
ter  the  interaction  with  the  measuring  instrument,  irrespective  of 
the  final  state  of the  latter  (and  of the  observer). 

2.04 The  measurement  conclusion.  When  the  original  object system 
and  observer  are  connected  b y   a  measuring  instrument,  which  con- 
sists  of  an  unramified  chain  of  one  or  more  interacting  systems,  it 
follows  from  (2.28)  that  the  conclusion  about  the  original  object 
system,  which  the  observer  can  infer  from  his  final  perception, 
certainly  cannot  go  further  than  to  indicate  which  of  the  pure 
quantum  states  q%,(t) is realized.  According  to  the  quantum  notion 
of observation  0q  the  observer  can  in  principle  actually  infer  that 
conclusion  under  ideal  conditions  and  he  cannot  infer  more  under 
any  condition.  This  rule  establishes  the  connection  between  the 
mathematical  formalism  and  the  observers  perceptions.  The  rule 
does  not  follow  from  the  formalism.  The  formalism  is  in  harmony 
with  the  rule.  The  rule  justifies  the  representation  of the  formalism 
in  terms  of pure  quantum  states. 

The  conclusion  derived  from  the  measurement  thus  consists  in 
indicating  which  pure  quantum  state  of the  mixture  (2.29)  or  (2.30) 
of  the  extended  or  original  object  system  is  realized  after  this 
measurement.  It  could indicate  equally  well the  realized  pure  quan- 
tum  state  of an  arbitrary  system or group  of systems of the  measur- 
ing  instrument.  For  a  great  number  of  measurements  on  identical 
object  systems  with  identical  initial  operators  the  statistical  pro- 
bability  of  realization  of  a  pure  quantum  state  with  index  tx  is 

ON  THE  PRINCIPLES  OF  ELEMENTARY  QUANTUM  MECHANICS  43~ 

according to  the  statistical  interpretation  of  (2.29)  or  (2.30)  ×l~,v(t0) 
(cf.  0q).  The  measuring result  is  independent  of the  place  of the cut 
in  the  measuring instrument  1). 

Formally we can distinguish the following stages in the measuring 
act.  First  the  object  system  is  coupled  with  the  measuring  instru- 
menL  which  gives  the  entangled  state,  then  the  systems  of  the 
measuring  chain  are  ignored,  which  gives  the  infringed  mixture, 
from which finally the realized state is selected. They are represented 
by  the  scheme:

2.05  The  measuring  o/observables.  For every system l we can define 
a  H  e r m  i t  i a n  operator  as(t)  for  which  the  functions ~%,(t) form a 
system  of  orthonormal  eigenfunctions  with  arbitrary  prescribed 
eigenvalues  at~(t ).  as(t)  commutes  with  H°(t) 

H°(t),  a/t) 

---- 0. 

(2.3 l) 

The  condition  (2.15)  is  then  equivalent  to  the  condition  that  Ol2(t ) 
must  commute  with  al(t),  or  in  general 

Hw+I)(t  ), at(t)  =  0. 

(2.32) 

In the pure quantum  state  q~,~,(t) the observable as(t ) has the value 
at~,(t).  A  measurement,  which  decides which of  the  states  ~%,(t) of l 
is  realized,  also  determines the  value  of ai(t).  It  can  be  regarded  as 
a  measurement  of  the  observable  as(t ).  This  establishes  the  experi- 
mental  meaning  of  the  value  of  an  observable."  Meanwhile,  re- 
membering  2.01,  one  should  be  careful  in  regarding  aid(t)  as  the 
proper  value of as(t ) . 

If  all eigenvalues  of  as(t )  are  different 

a,v(t)  for  ~  :#  ,, 

(2.33) 

the  value  of  at(t)  on  the  Other  hand  uniquely  determines  the  pure 
quantum  state  of  the  system  l.  Therefore,  instead  of  indicating 
which  state  ~%,(t) of l  is  realized,  the  observer can  in  the  ideal  case 
(2.33)  equally  well  (and  otherwise  less  well)  record  the  value  of 

Physica  XlI

al(t).  Usually  the  measuring  results  are  thus  stated  in  terms  of 
values of observables and  not  in  terms  of states.  For  this  purpose  it 
is  immaterial  whether these  values  (defined as  eigenvalues)  have  a 
proper meaning in the  sense of 2.01  or not. 

2.06  Correlated  observables.  Similarly  a  correlation  between  the 
states  of various  systems can  also be  expressed  as  a  correlation  be- 
tween  the  values  of  observables  of  these  systems.  As  a  particular 
case  we  consider  the  effect  of  ignoring  the  correlation  with  some 
systems  (infringement)  on  the  correlation  between  the  remaining 
systems.  This  effect  has  in  2.03  been  found  to  consist  in  the  dis- 
appearance  of  the  non-diagonal  statistical  operators  kzv~It) (Vt v~ v) 
of  the  latter  systems.  This h a s   no  influence  upon  the  expectation 
values  of  those  observables,  for  which  the  operators  are  diagonal 
with respect to  the functions ~l~(t).  That  means that  the correlation 
between  such  observables,  for  which  the  operators  c o m m u t e w i t h  
the az(t), remains unaffected. For other observables the non-diagonal 
elements are  dropped  and  the  correlation  is more or  less  destroyed. 
For  observables,  for  which  the  operator  has  no  non-z~ero diagonal 
elements with respect  to  the  ~z~,(t), no  elements remain  and  the cor- 
relation  is  entirely  destroyed. 

2.07  The pointer  reading.  When for some system in the chain, say l, 

the functions ~z~,(t) read in q-representation 

o,(t)  -----.~(q, - -   q,~,), 

so that  they are eigenfunctions of qz 

q~v,# =  q,~V,~, 

(2.34) 

(2.35) 

we  denote  the  measurement  as  a  (pointer)  reading.  Z is  called  the 
scale  system.  The measuring result  of a reading can be expressed by 
the value of the coordinate  of the scale system. 

A  simplified  model,  which  gives  such  a  coupling  between  the 
systems  ( l - -   1)  and  l,  that  the  values  of  the  observables  ae_1)(t ) 
are  measured  by  the  values  of  the  coordinate  q~,  is  obtained  1) 
with a  H  a  m  i 1 t  o n i a n  operator of the  type 

H{v-t)~(t) =  h(a(v_l)(t))  +/(a(~_l)(t))pv

The  condition  (2.32)  is  satisfied.  With  the  choice

so that  ~  has  the initial value q~0

is  satisfied  if 

F(a(v-l)~)  ~  F(a(~t)v)  for Vt :/:  v.

The  spectrum of the  values  qz~ (2.42)  need not  necessarily  cover the

systems is  entirely destroyed by  the  measurement  of the  canonical

2.08  Observational  connections.  For  a  relation  between  observa- 
tional  data  we  need  at  least  two  measurements.  We  consider  two 
succeeding  measurements  during  the  time  intervals  (to,tt)  and  (to,t't) 
with 

to >  tl 

(2.49) 

performed  on  the  same  system  1.  The  first  m e a s u r e m e n t   measures 
the  states  ~l~(t)  or  a  corresponding  observable  al (t),  the  second  one 
measures  the  states  9'1~,(t) or  a  corresponding  observable  a't(t ). 

If the first  measuring result  indicates  the final pure  q u a n t u m   state 
~01¢(t)  (h  <  t  <  t~),  the  statistical  operator  at  the  beginning  t~  of 
the  second  measurement  is  klm,(t~),  which  is  e x p a n d e d   according  to

measuring result  will indicate  the pure  q u a n t u m   state  ~,(t)  (t  >  t'l) is

This  conditional  probability  is  actually  the  most  e l e m e n t a r y   ex- 
pression  contained  in  the  formalism,  which  denotes  an  observable 
connection  and  which  has  a  directly  observable  statistical  meaning. 
W h e n   the  functions  ~ , ( t )   coincide  with  the  ~0(tt~), i.e.  when  a~(t) 

and  a I (t) commute,  (2.51)  becomes 

x;~,,,,,(t;)  =  8,,~ 

(2.52) 

and  the  second  measuring  result  can  be  predicted  with  certainty 
from  the  first.  In  this  case  we  have  essentially  the  repetition  of  a 
measurement.  (2.52)  expresses  the  reproducibility  of  the  measuring 
result. 

2.09  Intermingled  states.  The  entangled  state  of two  object  systems 
1 and  2  after  a  coupling  of  the  type  described  above  is  of  the  kind 

k12  =  Z  ~q,~ kl/~v k2/~v. 

p , ) v  

(2.53) 

The  probability  of finding system  1 in a  state  k t and  2 in  a  state  k2 is 

Tr(kt2klk2)  =  ~, xv~  Tr(kt#vkl  )  Tr(k2~,vk2). 

p,,v 

(2.54) 

When  k I and  k2 coincide with  the projection  operators  kl~ ~  and  k2v~, 

ON  THE  PRINCIPLES  OF  ELEMENTARY  QUANTUM  MECHANICS  4 3 ~  

(2.54)  becomes  equal  to  x~8~,v. This  might  (wrongly)  suggest  that 
(after the coupling and before the measurement) the state of  1 and  2 
is  the  mixture 

k'12 =  Z  x ~ k l ~   k 2 ~  

(2.55) 

instead of the state  (2.53).  In this way the correlation between  1 and 
2 would be  partially  destroyed by the  omission  of the  non-diagonal 
terms.  In  the  mixture  (2.55)  the  expectation  value  of  the  states  k 1 
and  k2 would be 

Tr(k2ktk2)  =  ~, × ~   Tr(kl~, kt)  Tr(k2~,~ k2)

(2.56) 

instead  of  (2.54).  It  has been emphasized by  F  u  r  r  y  8)  (in a  some- 
what different form and particularly against our common opponents, 
cf. 2.11)  that  only if neither kl  nor k 2 coincides with  any of the  kl~ ~ 
or k2~ respectively,  (2.56)  can be  different from  (2.54).  Because the 
latter  case  hardly  occurs  in  the  relevant  applications,  one  is  apt 
to  make  the  mistake  of replacing  (2.53)  by  (2.55)  (and  to  draw  un- 
justified conclusions whenever this case does occur). 

If  1  and  2  had  been  coupled  with  one  or  more  further  systems 

3, i . . .   according  to 

kt~ .... =  Z  ×v~ k l ~  k2~ k3~ . . . .

and  these  further  systems  had  been  ignored  afterwards,  the  in- 
fringed  state  of  1 and  2  would  correctly be  given  by  (2.55)  indeed. 
This infringed state is  quite  distinct  from the  entangled  state  (2.53). 
2.10  Multilateral  correlation.  In  (2.53)  the  transition  operators 
kl~v and  k2 m  belong to  two  systems of orthonormal wave  functions

R2.  An  interesting case *) is that  for  which k12 can  similar  to  (2.53) 
also be expanded With respect to the transition operatbrs llp~ and  12p, 
belonging  to  any  two  systems  of  wave  functions  ~blp and  ~b2p in 
Rt  and  R2,  when  one  system  is  chosen  arbitrarily  variable  but 
orthonormal  and  complete,  the  other  system  suitably  to  the  first

A necessary and sufficient condition *) for the occurrence of this case

The  factorization  of  x.~  means  that  k12  is  a  pure  q u a n t u m   state  of

The  special  case  under  discussion  can  easily  be  generalized  to  the 
in 
following  case.  The  functions  ~,~,  and  92~, are  taken 
groups  q~l~,,, c?lw, . . . .   and  q~2m, 92~, . . . . . .   which  span  the  (generaliz- 
ed)  H  i 1 b  e r  t  subspaces  Rn,R12 . . . . .   and  R21,R22 . . . . .  
respectively 
these 
(RI  ---- Rn  +  R12  + 
. . . .   ).  In 
and 
subspaces  we  take  a n y   two  sets  of  systems  +tin,  +t~ . . . . .  
%b2m, %b2p . . . . . . .   of  which  one  set  is  chosen  arbitrarily  variable  but 
orthonormal  and  complete,  the  other  suitably  to  the  first.  It  is 
easily  seen  t h a t   the  last  part  of  condition  (2.59)  then  has  to  be  re- 
placed  b y   x  v,  I ---- x~.  In  1-dimensional  subspaces  Rl#  and  R2p  all 
1-representations  are  essentially  the  same. 

and  R2  ----- R2t  +  R22  + 

. . . .  

An  equivalent  formulation  of  the  generalized  case  is  obtained  b y  
taking  instead  of  a n y   two  systems  of  wave  functions  %hip and  %b2p, 
as  in  the  special  case,  two  definite  systems  of  which  one  is  chosen 
arbitrarily  fixed  but  orthonormal  and  complete,  the  other  s u i t a b l y  
to  the  first.  Rn,Rl2 . . . . .   or  R2t,R22, • • • • are  then  determined  b y   the 
sharpest  division  of  R1  or  R2  into  subspaces,  which  span  linearly 
independent  groups  of  q~l~, and  %hip or  q~2~ and  +2p  at  the  same  time. 
We  restrict  ourselves  to  the  special  case.  First  we  show  the  ne- 

cessity  of  (2.59).  W i t h   (1.13)  it  follows  from  (2.58)  t h a t  

x~,  Trt (kl/zv It,p)  =  k,i, Tr2(k2v~,  12pa), 

x~,Tr2(k2m  12p.) =  X.pTrl (kirk, lip.). 

(2.61) 

It  follows  directly  t h a t  

xwx~,Tr~(k~ml,ap )  =  ),~pkp~Tr~  (k,~,~ll~p) (l  ----- 1,2), 

(2.62) 

so  that  (with  x.~  ---- x~,,  Xp.  =

  x;,~ 2  = 

  ;<~  2  or  Tr~  (k~,v 1,~)  =  0  (l  ----- 1 and  2). 

(2.63) 

Because  one  of  the  systems  lt, *  or  12m  is  arbitrarily  variable  and 
complete  in  R~  or  R2  the  latter  alternative  is  excluded  and  we  must 
have 

I ×~,~ I = 

  )'~,  I =  ×2  =  )$  (×  _  ), >  0). 

(2.64) 

ON  THE  PRINCIPLES  OF  ELEMENTARY  QUANTUM  MECHANICS 

With  (1.13)  it  further  follows from  (2.58)  t h a t  

Y- ×v~,Trl (kl m 11~0) k2~  ---- Xa 012o., 

Y~ ×v~Tr2(k2~ I2.p) kb. v ----- X.p l:p.. 

(2.6s) 

These  relations  connect  the  arbitrarily  and  the  suitably  chosen 
systems  and  establish  the  orthonormality  and  completeness  of  the 
latter.  With  (1.08)  we derive  from  (2.65)

(2.67) 

and  similarly for interchanged  indices  1 and  2.  (2.66)  and  (2.67)  must 
be  identical  according  to  (1.08).  Because  one  of  the  systems  lip .  or 
12pa is  arbitrarily  variable  and  complete  in  Rt  or  R2,  we  must  have 
(remembering  (2.64)) 

XI.~,vXvt ,  =  X2Xp,/~;  ~p,e~.p=~2~p,p  (X  =  X >  0). 

(2.68) 

Then  ×v~ and  Xp. must  have  the  form 

Xv~ =  x* x m  I x~, I =  x ;X.,  ----- X* X a,  I Xp   =  X. 

(2.69) 

This  shows  the  necessity  of  (2.59). 

The  sufficiency  can  be  shown  in  the  following  way.  Choose,  say 
in  RI,  a  complete  system  of  orthonormal  wave  functions  +lp  and 
choose  for  each  p  a  constant  ~p with  ~, 
  ----- X =  ×.  Then  take  the 
functions 

+2p =  1__ X x~ (+If, ~P,~) 72~,, 

;kp 

/~ 

(2.70) 

which are orthonormal  and complete in R2. From  (2.70)  it follows  that 

+lp  =  XpX __1  (qbtpq92~) 71~. 

(2.71) 

The  indices  1 and  2  could  equally  well have  been  interchanged.  For 
the  transition  operators  we  get

(2.74) 

This  shows  the  sufficiency  of  (2.59). 

It  is  of  importance  for  the  discussion  of  the  measuring  process, 
that  (contrary  to  the  expectation  of  R  u  a  r  k  5))  multilateral  cor- 
relation  between  more  than  two  systems  is  impossible.  We  first 
show  this  impossibility  for the  case  of 3  systems. 

Suppose  we  would  have  the  expansions 

k l ~   =  ~  ~  klmk2~k3~v  =  ~  ~pllml2pol3p~. 

(2.75) 

p , o  
With  (1.13)  it  follows  from  (2.75)  that

~%,Tr3(k3m 13op) =  ZopTrl (klv~, llp,)Tr2(k2~, 12po) (cycl.). 

(2.76) 

In the same w a y  as before it  follows t h a t  

I×m  2 =   ~'ml  2  or  Tr~(kzmllop)  = 0  

( l =   1 , 2 a n d 3 ) .  

(2.77) 

Because  one  of  the  systems  llpo  must  be  arbitrarily  variable  and 
complete  in  R~,  we  must  have 

I 

I = 

I x,o  I =  ×2  __  x2 

(×  _  x  >  0). 

(2.78) 

It  further  follows  from  (2.76)  t h a t  

or 

Tra(k3~,~ laop) Tr3(ka~  lap,)  :  1 

Trl (kl~,~ llop)Tr2(k2~, 12,,)  =  0  (cycl.). 

(2.79) 

Then  we  must  have 

Tr~(k~,,l~op)  =  Tr2(k2~vl2oa)  =  Tr~(k~,,l~o~)  ~  1 or  0.  (2.80) 

This  would  mean  t h a t   the  systems  of  1~,,,  12~, and  13po should  (but 
for  a  simultaneous  change  of  enumeration  of  the  Greek  indices  of 
the three corresponding  operators  and  but  for unimodular  constants) 
be  identical  with  those  of  k~,~,  k2~,~ and  k3~.  This  is  against  the 
assumption.  Multilateral  correlation  between  the  states  of  1, 2  and  3 
is  therefore  impossible.

For  more  systems  1,  2,  3 . . . . .  

the  impossibility  of  multilateral

Similar  to  (2.61)  and  (2.62)  we  get 

×~,Trl (kl~.~ 11,o) =  X,oTr2(k2~. 12oo). 
×.~Tr2(k2,.  12,,)  =  XoaTrt (kl..  11oo)

(2.84) 

× ~   =  -4- Xoo  or  Tr~(kt~. 1zoo) =  0  (l  =  1 and  2). 

(2.85) 

Because  one of the  systems  1zoo is arbitrarily  variable  the latter  alter- 
native  is  excluded  and  because  the  traces  in  (2.83)  are  non-negative 
we  must  have 

×..  =  x . . .  

(2.86) 

F u r t h e r   we  have  similar  to  (2.65)

(2.87) 

(2.88) 

(2.89) 

and  similarly  for  interchanged  indices  1 and  2.  Because  (2.88)  and 
(2.89)  have  to  be  identical  according  to  (1.08)  we  must  have 

Trl(klm,  llpp)Trl(klm,  ll~)  =  Trz(klm, llpp)~p~. 

(2.90) 

This  would  require 

Tr, (kl~ ~ l lpp) ---- Bp~

for  every  ~,  p  and  ~,  which  is  impossible.  Multilateral  correlation 
cannot  extend  over  more  than  two  systems.

H.J.  GROENEWOLD 

The  proofs  given  for  the  special  case  of  multilaterial  correlation 
in  the  entire  spaces  RI,/?2 . . . . .   can  easily  be  generalized  to  the  ge-

N o w   we  see  t h a t   also  in  the  measuring  process  multilateral  cor- 
relation  (in  the  special  or  in  the  generalized  sense)  cannot  be  trans- 
mitted  through  the  chain  of  systems  of  the  measuring  instrument. 
(2.28)  is  uniquely  determined.  This  excludes  the

inference  discussed  in  2.04  b y   the  application  of  multilateral  cor-

2.11  E  i n  s t e i  n 's  paradox.  We  return  to  the  two  object  systems  1 

and  2  in  the  multilateral  correlated  state  (2.58). 

If  the  state  of  one  of  the  systems,  say  2,  is  entirely  ignored,  the 

infringed  state  of  I  becomes 

×2 I~ kl~,~ =  X 2 lg ll0 r 

(2.92) 

The  sums  (which  are  identical)  denote  the  projection  operator  of the 
(generalized)  H  i 1 b  e r  t  subspace  Rl.  In  the  mixture  (2.92) all states 
in  R1  have  the  same  probability  ×2  =  X2.  If  Rl  coincides  with  the 
entire  (generalized)  H  i 1 b  e r  t  space  of  wave  functions  of  I,  the  in- 
fringed  state  (2.92)  becomes  entirely  undetermined. 

If  in  dealing  with  the  entangled  stat6  (2.58)  one  would  make  the 

mistake  pointed  out  b y   F  u  r  r  y 

(cf.  2.09),  one  would  get 

x 2  Y.  kl~k2~,~  =  X 2 Z  llpol2pp. 

(2.93) 

In  dealing  with  (2.82)  we  have  seen  that  (2.93)  cannot  hold.  (2.85) 
does  not  express  a  correlation  between  pure  q u a n t u m   states  of  1 
and  pure  q u a n t u m   states  of  2  (in  the  w a y   a  m e m b e r   of  (2.93)  would 
do). 

If,  however,  (after  the  interaction  between  1  and  2,  which  esta- 
blishes  the  state  (2.58))  one  of  the  systems,  say  2,  interacts  with  a 
measuring  instrument,  which  measures  the  states  12pp, the  infringed 
state  of  1 and  2  together  after  the  latter  interaction  is 

;~2 y~ it (cid:127)  12po" 

p 

(2.94) 

This  mixture  is  different  for  different  t y p e s   of  measurements, 
i.e. 
for  different  systems  12p p.  (2.94)  does  express  a  correlation  between 
peur  states  of  1 and  pure  states  of  2.  This  correlation  is of unilateral 

ON  THE  PRINCIPLES  OF  ELEMENTARY  QUANTUM  MECHANICS  44~ 

type.  W h e n   the  measuring  result  selects  for  2  the  state  12pp, the 
state  of  1 is llpp. 

After  the  interaction  between  1  and  2  has  taken  place,  an  ob- 
servable  bl  of  1  with  eigenstates  llpa  can  be  measured  in  two  dif- 
ferent  ways:  either  b y   a  direct  measurement  on  1,  or  b y   measuring 
an  observable  b2  of  2  with  eigenstates  12p p  (corresponding  to  llpp) 
b y   a  direct  measurement  on  2  (then  X can  be  conceived  as  a  part  of 
the  measuring  chain).  At  a  first  glance  it  might  seem  surprising  and 
perhaps  even  paradoxical  that  it  is  still  possible  to  decide  which 
observable  of  1 will  be  measured  b y   a  measurement  on  2  after  all  in- 
teraction  with  1 has  been  abolished  s)  and  that  it  is  possible  to  mea-

ment  of  bl  selects  a  state  out  of  the  right  m e m b e r   of the  expression 
(2.92)  for  the  infringed  state  of  1.  The  probability  that  one  measure- 
ment  selects  the  state  klm,,  if  the  other  selects  the  state  llpp  (or 
opposite)  is  according  to  (2.51) 

Tr(kl~llpp),

on  1  or  (no  m a t t e r   whether  successively  or  simultaneously)  one  of 
t h e m   on  1 and  the  other  one  on  2.  W h e n   b o t h   are  directly  measured 
on  1,  the  state  in  which  1 is  left  after  the  succeeding  measurements 
is  klm,  if  the  final  measurement  was  t h a t   of  at,  it  is  llpp  if  the  final 
measurement  was  t h a t   of  bl.  A  paradoxical  situation  .seems  to  arise 
if  one  asks  in  which  state  1 is  left  after  a~  has  been  measured  on  1 
and  bt  on  2  (or  opposite).  We  have  to  r e m e m b e r   (cf.  2.08)  that  all 
observational  s t a t e m e n t s   bear  on  "connections  between  measure- 
ments.  The  state  in  which  !  is left  has  only  an  observational  meaning 
with  regard  to  a  succeeding  measurement  of an  observable  of  l,  say 
cl  with  eigenstates  m~,,.  W h e n   the  measurement  of al  has  selected 
the  state  kl~,~,  the  probability 
the  measurement  of  ct  will 
select  the  state  m t ~   is

When  the  measurement  of  bl  has  selected  the  state  llp m  the  pro- 
bability  that  the  measurement  of  ct  will  select  the  state  m t ~   is 
Tr(llpprnl~). 

(2.95c) 

Thus  we  get  two  different  probabilities  for  the  same  event.  This  is 
not  unfamiliar  in  statistics,  because  the  probabilities  are  (always) 
conditional.  They  have  only  a  meaning  for  a  great  number  of com- 
bined  measurements  of  at,  bt  and  cl.  The  probability  of  finding  a 
state  klm,  is  ×2, the  probability  of finding  a  state  llpp is  )2,  the  pro- 
bability  of finding  a  state  m l ~   is then  according  to  (2.95b)  or  (2.95c) 

x 2 ~,  Tr(kl~,~,  ml~)  or  X 2 ~  Tr(llpp  m l ~ ) .  

(2.96) 

P 

Only  these  sums  have  to  be  identical  and  they  are  so  according  to 
(2.92). The  correlations  between  the  measuring  results  for  al,  bt and 
cl  are described b y   (2.95). 

Let  us  consider  once  more  the  measurement  of  al  and  of  bl,  one 
of them directly on  1 and the other  directly on  2. The  latter  measure- 
ment  can also be conceived as a  direct measurement  on  1 (the  system 
2 is then  regarded  as a part  of the  measuring  chain),  which preceedes 
the first mentioned  measurement.  The  only pecularity of the  present 
case is  that  after  the  coupling  between  the  object  system  1 and  the 
first system 2 of the measuring  chain  of the earliest  measurement  has 
been  abolished  (and  even  after  the  succeeding  measurement  has 
been  performed)  one can  thanks  to  the  multilateral  correlation  be- 
tween  1 and  2 still  decide which  observable will be measured  b y  this 
earliest  measurement.  But  when  we  p a y   due  regard  to  the  correl- 
ations  between  the  various  measuring  results,  this  leads  to  no  para- 
dox.

3.02 The trace. When  U  is a  unitary  operator

(3.12) 

the  unitary  transformation

(3.13) 

leaves  all  operator  relations  invariant.  Therefore  the  latter  can  be 
derived  in  a  suitably  chosen  representation. 

The eigenvalues q of q  and p  of p  are  assumed to run  continuously 
between  - - c o   and  +  oo.  In  q-representation  the  operators  q  and  p 
can be taken  in the  form 

q = q , = q , p = p t _ _ _ 7 ~

the  completeness  of  the  systems  of  operators

correspondence  I,  I I ,   I I I ,   IV  and  V'.  First  I  and  II. 

We  show  that  if  between  the  elements  a  of  one  ring  and  the  ele-

We  get  using  I  and  II 

(a  +  b) 2 - -   a 2 - -   b 2  =  ab  +  ba  <-----+ a b   +  b a  

(4.01) 

and  also  using  (4.01) 

a(ab  +  ba)  +  (ab  +  b a ) a -   a 2 b -   ba 2  =  2aba  <--->- 2 a b a  

{4.02) 

and  further  Using  (4.02)

2  <

(4.05) 

This  means  that  the  rings  are  isomorphous. 

It follows that,  if one ring is commutative and the other not,  I  and 
II  are inconsistent 9).  (When  the  commutators  arc  of the  order of h, 
the discrepancy is according to  (4.03)  of the order of h2).

and  the  non-commutative  ring  with  generating  elements  p  and  q

rule  (cf.  1.18) 

if a(p,q)  ~ - +   a  and b(p,q)  <  +  b, then  (a(p,q),  b(p,q))  ~ - +   a,b

(4.30)  would lead to  I,  (4.31)  is equivalent  to  V'. 

We  examine  which  functions  /(a)  satisfy  I.  From  (4.28)  we  see 

that  the  correspondence

(4.32)

(4.35) 

is  only satisfied  if  a  is  of  the  form  (xp  +  yq)n. Then  it  follows that 
any  polynomial  in  p  and  q  can  only  satisfy  (4.33)  if  it  is  a  poly- 
nomial  in  xp  +  yq.  This  finally  means  that  I  can  only  be  satisfied 
if a  is a  function of a  certain  linear combination  xp  +  yq of p  and  q- 
With the help of the  F  o u r i e r  expansion  (4.22)  it is easily seen that 
every (normalizable) function of xp  +  yq does satisfy I. Therefore the 
least restricted form of I, which is consistent with the correspondence 
(4.21) 

is 

/(xp  +  yq)  <-~  /(xp  +  yq).

As to  V',  we see from  (4.31)  that  for the  correspondence  (4.21)  the 

bracket  expression  ((a(p,q),  b(p,q)))  (cf.  1.14)  defined  b y  

if a(p,q)  ~ - ~  a  and  b(p,q) +--+b, then  ((a(p,q),  b(p,q))) +--+ a,b 

(4.37) 

is  given  b y  

((a(p,q),b(p,q)))  =  a(p,q)~-sln  2  8p  ~q 

8q  ~-p  b(p,q).  (4.38) 

If  a(p,q)  or b(p,q)  is a  polynomial  in  p  and  q of at  most  2nd  degree, 
we have  a  special  case  for  which  the  bracket  expressions  ((a,b))  and 
(a,b)  coincide. 

The  correspondence  (4.21)  is  a  solution  of  III  and  IV.  We  have 
not  investigated  the  possibility  of  other  solutions  with  the  same 
parameters  p  and  q.

(with  parameters  p  and  q  and  density  function  p(p,q)  =  I/h),  we 
obtain  a special case of a transformation  between a representation  in 
terms of operators k  and  a  and  a representation  in terms of functions 
k(p,q)  and  a(p,q).  Quantum  statistics  are  usually  represented  in 
terms  of operators,  classical  statistics  in  terms  of functions.  We  as- 
sert that  the usual description  is  also  the  proper  one.  Tiae  statistical 
operator  k  of  the  quantum  representation  and  the  statistical  distri- 
bution  function  k(p,q)  of  the  classical  representation  are  non-ne- 
gative  definite,  but  in  general  the  quantum  k(p,q)  and  the  classical 
k  are  not.  This  makes  that  for  orthogonal  states,  for  which 

Tr(klk2)  =  ~- 

dp d e kl(p,q)  k2(P,e)  ~-- O, 

(5.01) 

the  product  klk2  or k1(p,q)k2(J),q) vanishes  in  the  proper  representa- 
tion,  but  in  the  improper  representation  it  need  not.  The  equations 

4 5 4  

H . J .   GROENEWOLD 

of  motion  of  the  quantum  k  are  described  b y   infinitesimal  unitary 
transformations,  those  of  the  classical  k(p,q)  b y   infinitesimal  ca- 
nonical  transformations  (contact  transformations),  but  the  equa- 
tions  of  motion  of  the  classical  k  and  the  quantum  k(p,q)  are  in 
general  not  of  these  types.  Because  the  improper  representation  is 
formally  equivalent  to  the  proper  one,  it  is  (provided  it  is  not  mis- 
interpreted)  a  correct  description,  though  it  is  in  general  a  rather 
impracticable  one. 

In  spite  of  its  deficiences,  or  rather  because  of  them,  we  discuss 
some  aspects  of the  improper  representation  of quantum  mechanics 
in  terms  of k(p,q)  and  a(p,q),  i.e.  the  quasi-statistical  description  of 
the  1st  kind  Ql  (cf.  1.19).  It  more  or  less  illustrates  the  ways  along 
which  some  opponents  might  hope  to  escape  B  o h  r's  reasonings 
and  v o n   N e u m a n n ' s  
proof  and  the  places  where  they  are 
dangerously  near  breaking  their  necks. 

5.02  Transition 

/unctions.  For  the  transition  functions  k~,~(p,q) 
corresponding  to  the  transition  operators  (1.03)  according  to  (4.21) 
we  find  with  the  help  of  the  q-representation  (occasionally  expres- 
sing  the  inner  product  explicitely  b y   an  integral)  similar  to  (3.16)

Because  the  wave  functions  9~  are  only  determined  but  for  a

of the  special  case/(a)  ----- a  2,  it  is  not  for  a  proper  k  or  an  improper

is  of the  form 

a(xp  +  yq) 

(5.05) 

and  k  an  eigenstate  of  a.  For  any  k(p,q)  the  validity  of  (5.04)  re- 
quires  that  k(p,q)  is  of  the  form

(5.o6 

which  is  a  proper  (i.e.  non-negative  definite)  one.  Because (5.03) and 
(5.04)  are  identical,  th~  conditions  (5.05/and  fl5.06) are  equivalent. 
This  means  that  the  eigenstates  of  the  operators  a(xp  +  yqj  and 
of  no  other  operators  correspond  with  proper  (and  orthonormal 
and  therefore  non-overlapping)  distributions  of the  form  (5.06),  in 
which  a~, is the  corresponding  eigenvalue.  This  case would be rather 
encouraging  for  a  statistical  description  of  the  1st  kind  S 1,  if  it 
were  not  just  an  exceptional  case.

p,  which  is  the  eigenvalue  of xp  +  yq  (for  arbitrary  fixed  x  and  y), 
runs  between  - - o o   and  +  oo.  The  domain  of  eigenvalues  of 
a(xp  +  yq)  is  therefore  the  same  as  that  of  the  functions  a(z) 
( - -   oo  <  z  <  oo).  This  means  that  the  domain  of the  proper  values

The  representative  point  in  the  phase  space  of  a  superstate  rotates 
uniformly  about  the  origin  with  constant  radius  a/p 2 +  q2 and  cir- 
cular  frequency  co.  The  rotation  of  the  entire  distribution  k,nn(p,q) 
with  this  circular  frequency  co produces  according  to  the  last  factor 
of  (5.16)  a  periodicity  with  circular  frequency  ( m - - n ) o ~  
(like  a 
rotating  wheel  with  I m - - n  
spokes).  Also  this  would  have  a 
hopeful  aspect  for  a  description  of type  S t,  if it  were  not  one  out  of 
a  few exceptional  cases. 

5.05  The  scale  system.  We shortly  return  to  the  measuring  process. 
We  start  with  the  most  favourable  case  for  a  description  of the  1st 
kind  S 1 and  consider a  system I in the  measuring  chain,  for  which  the 
distributions  k~m,(p;,q, )  do  not  overlap.  The  corresponding  k , ~  
are  then  eigenstates  of an  operator  of the  form  xp~  +  yq;  (cf.  5.03). 
The  scale  system  is  a  special  case  (x  =  0),  which  shows  all  essential 
features.  According  to  (5.09)  we  have 

k~,v(p~,q~)  =  ~  q~ 

qt~,  q~  e-~ Cq~,--ql#l. 

By  ignoration  of  one  or  more  systems  of  the  measuring  chain  the 
non-diagonal  functions  (~  =# v)  are  dropped  and  only  the  diagonal 
functions  remain.  Instead  of  (5.19)  we  get 

k;~,v(p~,q,)  =  ~(q, - -   q~)  ~(q~, - -   q,~). 

(5.20) 

(The  latter  ~-function  is  actually  a  remainder  of  the  ignored  distri- 
bution  functions).  The  effect on  (5.19)  of ignoration  of other  systems 
is  formally  the  same  as  that  of  integration  over  p  with  density 
function  1/h.  This  illustrates  even  more  plainly  than  before  (cf. 2.07) 
how  the  correlation  between  p~  and  other  observables is  completely 
destroyed  b y   the  reading  of ql.  So  far  there  is  no  difficulty  with  an 
interpretation  of the  1st kind.  We  are  only concerned  with  the  value 
of q~, which  is  a  proper  value  and  uniquely  determines  the  distribu- 
tion  (5.20).  The  value  of  p~  is  indifferent.  As  soon  as  inference  is 
made  about  other  systems  in  the  chain  with  overlapping  k~,~(p,q), 
correct  results  are  only  obtained  after  the  integration  over  pt  (with 
density  function  1/h)  has  been  performed  (cf.  1.19).  In  a  description 
of  the  1st  kind  this  integration  could  only  be  interpreted  as  an 
averaging  over  a  great  number  of  measurements.  But  the  integra- 
tion has  already to be performed  in  a  si,ngle  reading  and  therefore  an 
interpretation  of the  1st kind  is excluded.

(5.21) 

This  shows clearly the correlation  between ql  and  q2 and  between p, 
and p2.The similarity.to a genuine distribution  of the  I st kind is very 
tempting. 

Because (5.21)  is highly singular we also consider the distribution

(5.25) 

The  correlation  between Pl  and  P2 or  qt  and  q2 respectively has  en-

If the state of 2 is entirely ignored, the distribution of the infringed

(5.26)).  A  measuring  result  q2 =  q2~ or  P2  -~  P2p selects  from  (5.23)

(5.29) 

Also  in  this  example,  in  which  all  distribution  functions  derived 
from  (5.21)  are  non-negative  definite,  it  is  already.the  particular 
part  of  the  immediate  integration  over  half  of  the  parameters  even 
in  a  single  measurement,  which  does  not  fit  into  an  interpretation 
of  the  1st  kind. 

These  few attempts  and failures to carry through  a genuine  statis- 
tical description  of the  1st kind S 1 may  suffice to illustrate  the inten- 
tion  and  troubles  of  such  a  conception.
