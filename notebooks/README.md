# Notebooks

Research notebooks for material that has graduated from the blackboard but is
**not aimed for publication**.

## Rules
1. **Append-only.** Content can be added to a notebook but never edited or deleted
   within it. If a notebook becomes wrong or obsolete, discard it entirely.
2. **Not citable.** Like blackboards, notebooks are internal working documents.
3. **Entry point.** Promoted from blackboards when the material is stable enough
   to keep but not suited for a paper.
4. **Exit paths:**
   - Content may later be promoted into a paper if it matures.
   - Or discarded fully if it becomes irrelevant.
