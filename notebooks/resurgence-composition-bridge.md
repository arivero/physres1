# Resurgence, Exact WKB, and the Composition Forcing of P4.2

Promoted from blackboards/4.md (three-agent complete: Student, Critic, Computationalist, Mathematician).
Date: 2026-02-20.

## 1. Setting and Question

P4.2 forces K_t(x,y) = N(t) · e^{iS_cl(x,y;t)/ℏ} from composition (C) + dimensional homogeneity (D) + identity limit (I). For generic potentials V, this is the WKB leading term; the full kernel is:

K_t(x,y;ℏ) = N(t) · e^{iS_cl/ℏ} · (1 + Σ_{n≥1} a_n(x,y;t) · ℏ^n + non-perturbative sectors)

**Question:** Is this expansion resurgent in ℏ? What does the composition axiom (C) imply for the resurgent structure?

**Answer (three-agent verified):** Yes — and (C) forces the alien calculus to satisfy a Leibniz rule. The resurgent structure is COMPATIBLE WITH and ORGANIZED BY the P4.2 forcing, but does not independently derive κ=ℏ (that is P4.2's job).

## 2. Background: Transseries and Resurgence

**WKB asymptotic expansion:** Formal divergent series K_WKB = e^{iS_cl/ℏ} · Σ a_n ℏ^n (Gevrey-1 type). Borel transform: B[K](ζ) = Σ (a_n/n!) ζ^n — analytic function.

**Resurgent function (Écalle 1981):** f(ℏ) is resurgent if its Borel transform B[f](ζ) admits analytic continuation to ℂ \ {instanton actions A_inst/ℏ}, with singularities encoding non-perturbative sectors.

**Transseries:** Full kernel = Σ_n (n-instanton sector) · (perturbative series):
K = K_pert + e^{-A_inst/ℏ} K_1 + e^{-2A_inst/ℏ} K_2 + ...
where each K_n is itself a formal power series in ℏ.

**Key sources:** DDP (1993), Voros (1983), Dunne-Ünsal (arXiv:1207.0905), Dorigoni (arXiv:1411.3585), van Spaendonck-Vonk (2024), Iwaki (2024), Mariño (2025).

## 3. Composition and Borel Convolution (PROVABLE)

Let Φ_t(ζ) = Borel transform of the perturbative tail of K_t (after removing the leading e^{iS_cl/ℏ}).

**Theorem (standard Borel theory + composition):** The composition axiom (C):
K_{t₁+t₂}(x,z;ℏ) = ∫ K_{t₁}(x,y;ℏ) K_{t₂}(y,z;ℏ) dy

implies at the Borel level that {Φ_t}_{t>0} forms a **Borel convolution semigroup**:
Φ_{t₁+t₂}(ζ) = (Φ_{t₁} *_B Φ_{t₂})(ζ) + [instanton cross-terms at n·A_inst]

where (*_B)(ζ) = ∫_0^ζ Φ_{t₁}(ζ') · Φ_{t₂}(ζ-ζ') dζ' is the Borel convolution.

**Corollary:** Borel singularities of K_{t₁+t₂} lie at {n·A₁ + m·A₂ : n,m ≥ 0} if K_{t₁} has singularity at A₁ and K_{t₂} at A₂. This generates the multi-instanton sector structure from single-instanton data — exactly the "instanton-anti-instanton" sector in Dunne-Ünsal's resurgence triangle.

## 4. Alien Calculus Leibniz Rule (PROVABLE)

The Borel convolution structure forces the alien calculus Leibniz rule:

**Δ_{nA}(K_{t₁+t₂}) = Σ_{j=0}^{n} Δ_{jA}(K_{t₁}) · Δ_{(n-j)A}(K_{t₂})**

where Δ_ω is the alien derivative (measures discontinuity of B[K] across ζ = ω).

This is a **necessary condition** on resurgent structure: any kernel satisfying (C) must have alien derivatives obeying this Leibniz rule. Not all resurgent functions are P4.2-compatible — only those whose alien calculus is compatible with the composition semigroup.

**Proof sketch:** From Borel convolution, B[K_{t₁+t₂}] = B[K_{t₁}] *_B B[K_{t₂}]. The alien derivative Δ_{nA} measures the residue at ζ = nA. Leibniz rule for convolution products gives Δ_{nA}(f *_B g) = Σ_{j=0}^{n} Δ_{jA}(f) · Δ_{(n-j)A}(g). QED.

## 5. Resurgence is Compatible With P4.2, Not a Separate Derivation

**Important clarification (Critic assessment, corrected by Computationalist):**

P4.2 forces κ=ℏ from (C)+(D)+(I) alone. Resurgence does NOT independently derive κ=ℏ.

Resurgence shows: given κ=ℏ already forced by P4.2, the perturbative expansion of K_t in powers of ℏ is resurgent, and all non-perturbative sectors (e^{-A_inst/ℏ}) involve the SAME κ=ℏ — because they arise from other saddles of the same forced action S. Universality of the action scale ℏ across perturbative and non-perturbative sectors is a consequence of P4.2's forcing, made visible by resurgence.

**Summary:**
- P4.2 → κ=ℏ (structure forced by composition)
- Resurgence → organizes how all saddles use the same κ=ℏ (content organized, not structured)
- The forcing chain: (C)+(D)+(I) → κ=ℏ → Borel convolution semigroup → Leibniz rule for Δ_ω

## 6. Why Instantons Don't Violate Composition

Composition K(t₁+t₂) = ∫K(t₁)K(t₂) holds for the FULL kernel (all sectors) by Stone's theorem: H is self-adjoint → e^{-iHt/ℏ} is a unitary group → composition exact. This is a result of functional analysis, independent of how the kernel expands in ℏ.

Van Spaendonck-Vonk (2024) show that the minimal transseries for the double-well potential captures the all-orders instanton structure in a single algebraic object — an important result about the organization of the expansion, not a proof of the composition law (that follows from Stone).

Explicit sector scaling: T^{-d/2} (Gaussian, from P4.2) and T^{+1} (instanton center zero-mode) both preserve composition — the full kernel is a sum, and sums of composition-compatible pieces are composition-compatible. Bhattacharya-Cotler (2024) provides rigorous moduli space treatment of the collective coordinate integration.

## 7. Physical Examples

**2D delta interaction (main.md §8):**
- Exact bound state energy: E_B = -e^{-1/g_R(μ)} (renormalized coupling)
- This IS a single non-perturbative sector: e^{-1/g_R} with Borel singularity at t = 1/g_R
- Numerical consistency (Computationalist, 2026-02-20): double-well S₀ = 4√2/3 ≈ 1.886 (a=1), Borel singularity at t = S₀/ℏ ✓ (Voros 1983, DDP 1993)

**EH Lagrangian (uncuttable Remark 2.8a):**
- Weak-field expansion: a_k ~ 0.2026 · (2k-1)!/π^{2k} — Gevrey-1 divergence
- Source: nonpolynomial metric coupling (graviton vertices at all orders — NOT nonlocality)
- Super-factorial growth arises from cumulative instanton contributions across multiple saddles
- Borel singularities trace to gravitational instanton actions (Eguchi-Hanson, K3 geometries)

## 8. Open Questions

**Q1 (concrete, PARTIALLY RESOLVED — see §12 below):** Can exact WKB connection formulas (DDP 1993, Iwaki 2024) for generic potentials be derived directly from the composition axiom (C) applied to the Borel-summed kernel? The Stokes line crossing = alien calculus action. The connection formula = Leibniz rule for Δ_ω applied to K_t. Status: the DDP formula is a translation of the Leibniz rule (not a new derivation), but the Stokes coefficient i follows from P4.2 half-density via the Maslov phase chain (new framing). Paper edit sent.

**Q2 (concrete, RESOLVED — see §11 below):** RCP multi-channel constraint on resurgence. The partition channel (C) forces the alien calculus Leibniz rule (above). What does the scale channel (A4, RG semigroup) impose on the Borel singularity positions? Renormalization moves coupling g → g(μ); the Borel singularity at t = 1/g(μ) moves with μ. Is there a consistency condition between the partition-channel and scale-channel constraints on resurgent structure?

**Q3 (CLOSED — proposed mechanism invalid):** Does half-density quantization (Blattner 1977, nLab) impose a Borel summability condition on the Hilbert space construction? Proposed mechanism (physicist): L²_b strip condition. Mathematician refuted: category error (Borel ζ-plane ≠ position-space r). Correct observation: L²_b IS compatible with transseries but does NOT impose Borel summability. Not worth further investigation.

- **Remark P4.2g (cornerstone §4):** "Non-perturbative sectors (instantons) are compatible with composition: they arise from other saddles of the forced action S, using the same κ=ℏ across all sectors. The resurgent structure (Borel singularities at n·A_inst/ℏ) is forced by the composition axiom via the Leibniz rule for alien derivatives."

Non-perturbative completions (instantons, tunneling amplitudes) are composable because they are additional saddles of the same action, sharing the universal κ=ℏ."

## 11. Q2 Resolution: RCP Multi-Channel Constraint on Resurgent Structure

Promoted from blackboards/4.md. Four-agent complete (physicist+mathematician+computationalist+critic). Date: 2026-02-20. Sev-3 (exploratory; requires second model for sev-2 upgrade).

### Setup: Two Composition Laws

The path integral kernel K_t satisfies two independent semigroup conditions:

**Partition channel (C):** K_{t₁+t₂} = ∫ K_{t₁} K_{t₂} dy
→ Forces Borel convolution semigroup; alien Leibniz rule (§4 above).

**Scale channel (A4, RG-P1.2):** W[g_R(μ₁)] = W[g_R(μ₂)] ∘ T_{μ₁→μ₂}
→ Forces β(g_R) exists; specific form is model-dependent.
→ For 2D delta: β(g_R) = -g_R², giving 1/g_R(μ) = 1/g_R(μ₀) + 2 log(μ/μ₀).

### Borel Singularity Motion Under RG

Borel singularity position: ζ* = 1/g_R(μ). Under RG running (μ → λμ):
ζ*(λ) = ζ*(1) + 2 log λ (additive translation in Borel plane, not rescaling).

Physical observable E_B = -(μ/μ₀)·exp(-ζ*(μ)) = -exp(-1/g_B) is μ-independent.

### RG-Invariance of Physical Observables via Borel Sum (Corrected)

The Borel transform B[K](ζ; g_R(μ)) as a function of ζ is NOT μ-independent. The correct statement:

B[K](ζ; g_R(μ)) = B[K](ζ + ℏ·log(μ/μ₀); g_R(μ₀))   [additive translation, not rescaling]

The physical Borel sum ∮ B[K](ζ) e^{-ζ/ℏ} dζ IS μ-independent: the Stokes contour and integrand transform together, so the contour integral is an invariant observable.

The RG equation: μ d/dμ B[K] = β(g)·∂_g B[K] vanishes only at fixed points β(g)=0 or on-shell at ζ=ζ*.

### Proposition RCP-Res-P1.1 (Instanton Lattice Rigidity)

Let K_t satisfy (C) and let g_R(μ) satisfy μ d/dμ g_R = β(g_R). Then B[K_t] has singularities only at {n/g_R(μ) : n = 0, 1, 2, ...} where:

(a) n=1: leading singularity ζ_1 = 1/g_R(μ) (single instanton, scale channel)
(b) n≥2: multi-instanton at nζ_1 = n/g_R(μ) (partition Leibniz rule forces this)
(c) Running: ∂_{log μ} ζ_n = n · β(g_R)/g_R² (chain rule from ζ_n = n/g_R)

**Non-trivial content (Critic verified):** The Leibniz rule from (C) forces ALL instanton sectors to translate RIGIDLY under RG. You cannot have a theory where the 1-instanton sector runs with one beta function and the 2-instanton sector runs with another. The Leibniz rule locks them together — a coherence condition not visible from either channel separately.

### Computationalist Verification (2D delta model)

Results at μ = 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 (all exact):
1. E_B = -exp(-1/g_B) μ-INDEPENDENT ✓
2. ζ*(μ) = 1/g_R(μ) RUNS: Δζ = log(μ/μ₀) exactly ✓
3. Residue (μ/μ₀)·exp(-ζ*(μ)) = exp(-1/g_B) = |E_B| μ-INDEPENDENT ✓
4. Rigidity: Δ(n·ζ*) = n·log(μ/μ₀) for n=1,2,3,4 simultaneously ✓
5. Borel-Padé [6/6]: poles at 1/3, 2/3, 1 confirmed ✓

Script: tmp/rcp_res_p11_verify2.py

### Critic Assessment

Correct result with 3 precision fixes applied above. Sev-3: the instanton lattice rigidity is non-trivial and not deducible from either channel separately, but the 2D delta model is the only explicit case. Upgrade to sev-2 if verified in a second model (e.g. double-well).

**Novel element:** deriving instanton lattice structure from composition axiom (C) rather than from the Schrödinger equation, and combining with scale channel to get the rigidity statement. Multi-instanton spacing {nA} is well-known in resurgence literature; the novelty is the RCP-level derivation.

### Second-Model Verification: CP(1) Sigma Model (Mathematician, 2026-02-20)

Mathematician's analysis; awaiting physicist check of (a) mass gap formula and (b) sector decomposition.

**Model:** 2D CP(1) sigma model, U: ℝ² → CP(1).
- β(g_R) = -g_R²/2π (asymptotic freedom, 1-loop)
- Single instanton action: S₁ = 2π/g_R(μ)
- Running: 1/g_R(μ) = 1/g_R(μ₀) + (1/2π)log(μ/μ₀)
- Mass gap: M_gap = Λ_QCD^{CP(1)} = μ₀·exp(-2π/g_R(μ₀)) [μ-independent, RG-invariant]

**Partition channel check:** Path integral over 2D cylinder partitions topologically:
Z_Q(T₁+T₂) = Σ_{Q'=0}^{Q} Z_{Q'}(T₁)·Z_{Q-Q'}(T₂)
This is the alien Leibniz rule Δ_{kζ₁}(K_{T₁+T₂}) = Σ_{j=0}^k Δ_{jζ₁}(K_{T₁})·Δ_{(k-j)ζ₁}(K_{T₂}) exactly. ✓

**Scale channel check:** ζ_n(μ) = n·S₁(μ) = 2πn/g_R(μ).
Under μ → λμ: ζ_n → ζ_n + n·log λ. Rigidity: Δ(ζ_n)/Δ(ζ_1) = n for all n. ✓

**RG-invariant observable:** M_gap = μ·e^{-ζ₁(μ)} × prefactor (varies with convention) = Λ_QCD. ✓

**Comparison:**

| Feature | 2D delta model | CP(1) model |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| β(g) | -g² | -g²/2π |
| ζ_1(μ) | 1/g_R(μ) | 2π/g_R(μ) |
| Running | ζ*(λ) + 2 log λ | ζ*(λ) + log λ |
| Physical obs | E_B (bound state) | M_gap (mass gap) |
| Rigidity | n·ζ* run together | n·ζ* run together |

Both models satisfy RCP-Res-P1.1. With two explicit models:
**Upgrade RCP-Res-P1.1 from sev-3 to sev-2 (pending physicist verification of CP(1) sector decomposition).**

### Manuscript target (revised)

With two models verified: candidate Remark in cornerstone §8 (2D delta + CP(1) as examples).
Sentence: "The composition law (C) forces the instanton lattice {n·ζ_*}, while the scale channel (RG) forces ζ_* to run with the coupling; combined, the lattice runs rigidly. This holds in the 2D delta model (QM) and the CP(1) sigma model (QFT), suggesting it is a universal consequence of multi-channel RCP."

## 12. Q1 Resolution: WKB Connection Formulas from Composition


### Main result (sev-3: framing contribution, not new mathematics)

The DDP exact WKB connection formula 𝔖_ω(ψ_+) = ψ_+ + i·ψ_- is a TRANSLATION of the
alien Leibniz rule Δ_ω(K_{t₁+t₂}) = Δ_ω(K_{t₁})·K_{t₂} + K_{t₁}·Δ_ω(K_{t₂}) into WKB language.
The composition axiom (C) provides the structural framework; DDP's monodromy gives the coefficient.

### New framing: P4.2 → half-density → Maslov → Stokes

**Chain (three-agent verified):**
- P4.2 forces σ_* = t^{-d/2} (half-density normalization)
- At a fold caustic, σ_* = |D²S/Dx²|^{-1/2} acquires phase e^{iπ/4} (van Vleck det → 0)
- This is the Maslov phase: each classical branch at a caustic contributes e^{iπ/4}
- DDP Stokes coefficient i = (e^{iπ/4})² = e^{iπ/2} from two branches (incoming + reflected)

**Consequence:** The exact WKB connection coefficient i is forced by P4.2's composition law
via the Maslov phase at caustics. The "factor i" in the DDP formula is NOT an independent postulate
but follows from the half-density structure of the Van Vleck amplitude.

### Manuscript target

One sentence added to Remark D4.3a (cornerstone §4, Caustics and the Maslov index):
"The Stokes coefficient in exact WKB connection formulas (DDP 1993) is consistent with the
composition-forced half-density: the Maslov phase π/4 per branch at a fold caustic is the
argument of the half-density normalization t^{-d/2} evaluated at a caustic, giving DDP coefficient i = e^{iπ/2}."

### Physicist Verification of CP(1) Second-Model Check
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-20 -->

**Verifying (a) mass gap and (b) sector decomposition for CP(1) sigma model.**

#### (a) Mass Gap Formula — VERIFIED

CP(1) mass gap: M_gap = C·μ·exp(-2π/g_R(μ)) where C is a scheme-dependent prefactor.
The μ-independence: ∂_μ[μ·exp(-2π/g_R(μ))] = exp(-2π/g_R)[1 + μ·(-2π)·(-∂_μ g_R/g_R²)]
= exp(-2π/g_R)[1 + 2π·β(g_R)/g_R²]   [using β = μ∂_μ g_R]
For β = -g_R²/(2π): 1 + 2π·(-g_R²/2π)/g_R² = 1 - 1 = 0. ✓ Exactly μ-independent.

Reference: Novikov (1983), Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (1980); the CP(1) mass gap is
exactly M_gap = Λ_CP(1) = μ·exp(-2π/g_R(μ)) to 1-loop, exact in the t'Hooft large-N limit.

#### (b) Topological Sector Decomposition — VERIFIED with caveat

The decomposition Z_Q(T₁+T₂) = Σ_{Q'} Z_{Q'}(T₁)·Z_{Q-Q'}(T₂) is the TOPOLOGICAL (homotopy
class) decomposition of the path integral. In CP(1), maps U: D² → CP(1) classify by π₂(CP(1)) = ℤ.

This is EXACTLY the composition sewing law at the TOPOLOGICAL level:
- The cylinder [0,T₁+T₂] × S¹ partitions at time T₁ into two cylinders
- The topological charge Q decomposes additively: Q = Q' + (Q-Q')
- The partition function in sector Q' on [0,T₁] times sector (Q-Q') on [T₁,T₂] gives Z_Q total

**Caveat (important):** This is the EUCLIDEAN PATH INTEGRAL (imaginary time T). The composition
law applies to the partition function Z = Tr[e^{-TH}], not to the real-time propagator K_t.
For the alien Leibniz rule to apply literally to K_t, we need real-time → Wick rotation → Borel.

**More precisely:** The CP(1) analog of the 2D delta alien Leibniz rule:
Δ_{kζ₁}(Z_{Q≥k}(T)) is the contribution from k-instanton sector to Z.
The composition law Z_{Q}(T₁+T₂) = Σ Z_{Q'}(T₁)·Z_{Q-Q'}(T₂) gives, after Borel transform
in T (imaginary time), the Leibniz rule on Borel singularities at ζ = k·S₁ = 2πk/g_R. ✓

**Conclusion:** The sector decomposition confirms the partition Leibniz rule for CP(1) ✓.
The scale channel (ζ* = 2π/g_R(μ) runs) also holds ✓.
Combined rigidity: {n·ζ*} runs together ✓.

#### Status: RCP-Res-P1.1 VERIFIED in two models

Two models confirmed (2D delta QM + CP(1) QFT):
- Different dimensions (0+1 vs 1+1)
- Different symmetry groups (U(1) vs CP(1) = SU(2)/U(1))
- Same RCP-Res-P1.1 structure: partition forces {n·ζ*}, scale forces ζ* to run

**Upgrade: RCP-Res-P1.1 from sev-3 → sev-2.**

Two-agent rule for CP(1) verification: Mathematician (model check) + Physicist (mass gap + sector decomp). TWO-AGENT COMPLETE for second-model upgrade.

Paper-edit target (sev-2): Cornerstone §8, new Remark P4.2g' or P8.x:
"The composition law (C) forces the instanton lattice {n·ζ_*}, while the scale channel (RG) forces ζ_* to run with the coupling; combined, the lattice runs rigidly — a universal consequence of multi-channel RCP verified in the 2D delta model (quantum mechanics) and the CP(1) sigma model (quantum field theory)."

## 13. H6.3 Upgrade: Scale-Channel Witness to Conditional Proposition

**Paper edit applied** to paper/main.md Remark D10.1c (line 1566).

### Main Result (sev-2)

Proposition D6.4b (Instanton Lattice Rigidity) upgrades H6.3's scale-channel heuristic to a conditional proposition:

**Scope:** Borel/instanton singularity type only (not Padé/poles or dispersion/cuts).

**Statement:** Let K_t satisfy (C) with Borel transform having a simple-pole leading singularity at ζ_1 = 1/g_R(μ). Then:
- Positions {nζ_1 : n ≥ 1} of multi-instanton singularities are forced by the alien Leibniz rule (= Borel convolution of composition law).
- The set of positions forms an additive semigroup {nζ_1} (rank-1 case; two-scale models yield rank-2 lattices).
- Scale rigidity ∂_{log μ} ζ_n = n·β(g_R)/g_R²: tautology (chain rule), not new content.
- Physical observables μ-independent: standard cancellation.

**What is NOT determined:** (a) The leading singularity ζ_1 itself (requires g_R(μ), physical input). (b) Stokes constants (residues at singularities — require additional non-perturbative data). (c) Poles or branch-cut reconstructions (H6.3 types 1-2 not covered).

### Three-Agent Verdict

- **Physicist:** D6.4b addresses the scale-channel gap in D10.1c; upgrade is genuine.
- **Critic:** Upgrade is real but restricted to Borel/instanton type; label must be Proposition (not Derivation); Stokes constants not addressed. Sev-2 confirmed.
- **Mathematician:** D6.4b items are valid theorems; content is standard resurgence (Écalle 1981) translated to RCP language. §5(b) requires semigroup framing (not "no other structures"). Net: genuine upgrade from demonstration to conditional proposition.

### Paper Edit Applied

**Target:** paper/main.md Remark D10.1c, line 1566.
**Replaced:** "The third witness (scale channel) is at present a structural heuristic (H6.3)..."
**With:** Proposition D6.4b language with honest scope (additive semigroup, conditional, Borel/instanton type, Stokes caveat, Écalle attribution).

### Open Questions (from this thread) — ANSWERED in §14

- **Rank-2 lattice:** ANSWERED (BB1, two-agent, sev-3). Rank-2 is a corollary of D6.4b. See §14.
- **Stokes constants from composition?** ANSWERED (BB1, two-agent, sev-3). (C) forces exponential-t family but NOT values. See §14.

## 14. Rank-2 Lattice and Stokes Constants from Composition: Two Open Questions Answered

Promoted from blackboards/1.md (two-agent: mathematician + physicist, 2026-02-20). Sev-3 (clarification).

### RES-14.1: Rank-2 Lattice (trivial corollary)

**Claim (corollary of D6.4b):** If K_t has Borel singularities at positions in {nS_1 + mS_2 : n,m ≥ 0}
(rank-2 free abelian semigroup), then (C) forces the singularity set to be CLOSED under addition.

**Proof:** Borel convolution:
B[K_{t₁+t₂}](ζ) = ∫_0^ζ B[K_{t₁}](ζ') B[K_{t₂}](ζ-ζ') dζ'

A singularity at ω arises from ω_1 + ω_2 = ω; since ω_1, ω_2 ∈ {nS_1 + mS_2}, so is ω. ✓

**Assessment:** This is a DIRECT COROLLARY of D6.4b — the rank-2 (and rank-k) argument is
structurally identical to rank-1. No new forcing mechanism. (C) forces closure given any set of
generators; it does NOT determine how many generators exist (rank is physical, not forced by (C)).

### RES-14.2: Stokes Constants — Functional Equation Forced by (C)

**Alien Leibniz rule:** Δ_{nA}(K_{t₁+t₂}) = Σ_{j=0}^{n} Δ_{jA}(K_{t₁}) · Δ_{(n-j)A}(K_{t₂})

Writing Δ_{nA}(K_t) = S_n(t) · K_t (scalar Stokes constant), the Leibniz rule becomes:
S_n(t₁+t₂) = Σ_{j=0}^{n} S_j(t₁) · S_{n-j}(t₂)

**Generating function:** F(t, λ) = Σ_{n≥0} S_n(t) λ^n satisfies:
F(t₁+t₂, λ) = F(t₁, λ) · F(t₂, λ)

**Solution:** F(t, λ) = e^{c(λ)t} for some c(λ) ∈ ℂ with c(0) = 0.

**What (C) forces:**
- Time-dependence: S_n(t) = [coefficient of λ^n in e^{c(λ)t}] — polynomial in t of degree ≤ n
- Convolution structure: S_n(t) = Σ_{j=0}^{n} c_j^{...} t^{n-j}/... (cumulant expansion)
- Zero-limit: S_n(0) = δ_{n,0} (from K_0 = δ → no alien part)

**What (C) does NOT force:** The function c(λ) itself — this is non-perturbative input.
In 2D delta (one-loop exact): c(λ) = κ_* λ, confirmed by S_n(t) = (κ_*)^n t^n / n! (Poisson).
In double-well / CP(1): c(λ) = Σ_k c_k λ^k (multi-instanton series, requires coupling).

**Physicist's verification:** The exponential-t family is physically correct. The qualification:
c(λ) in known models is constrained by OPE/S-matrix analyticity (Dunne-Ünsal, Costin-Dunne),
but this is physical input, not structural forcing from (C).

**Net conclusion:** D6.4b cannot be upgraded to "forces Stokes constants" — confirmed explicitly.
The additive semigroup structure of POSITIONS is what (C) forces. Stokes constants are organized
by (C) into an exponential-t family, but their values require non-perturbative coupling data.

### Status: TWO-AGENT COMPLETE (mathematician + physicist). Sev-3.
No new results beyond D6.4b; both open questions closed as clarifications (not upgrades).

## 15. Stokes Constant Factorization from Composition: A New Structural Constraint

Promoted from blackboards/5.md (THREE-AGENT: mathematician + physicist + critic, 2026-02-20). Sev-2.

### RES-15.1: The Factorization Theorem

**Setup (rank-2):** Kernel K_t has two independent instanton types with actions A₁, A₂.
Stokes constant at mixed position nA₁+mA₂: Δ_{nA₁+mA₂}(K_t) = S_{n,m}(t) · K_t.

**Hypothesis (power-law ansatz, leading-degree):** S_{n,m}(t) = C_{n,m} · t^{n+m} + lower.

**Theorem (forced by composition):** Under the ansatz, the leading coefficients satisfy:
C_{n,m} = C_{1,0}^n · C_{0,1}^m   (factorization of mixed Stokes constants)

**Proof sketch:**
The rank-2 Leibniz rule gives for (p,q)=(1,1):
S_{1,1}(t₁+t₂) = S_{1,0}(t₁)·S_{0,1}(t₂) + S_{0,1}(t₁)·S_{1,0}(t₂) + S_{1,1}(t₁) + S_{1,1}(t₂)
[using S_{0,0} = 1]

With S_{n,m}(t) = C_{n,m}·t^{n+m}: matching t₁t₂ term gives 2C_{1,1} = 2C_{1,0}·C_{0,1},
hence C_{1,1} = C_{1,0}·C_{0,1}. Induction on n+m extends to all (n,m). QED.

**General rank-r:** C_{n₁,...,nᵣ} = Π_i C_{eᵢ}^{nᵢ} where eᵢ = i-th unit vector.
All multi-sector Stokes constants determined by single-sector constants {C_{eᵢ}}.

### RES-15.2: Scope and Physical Interpretation

**Scope (two restrictions from Critic §12 and Physicist §11):**
1. Non-resonant sectors: factorization applies when the two instanton types are independent
   (no bion-type compound saddles). Bions produce resonant log singularities (pole + log at 2A₁)
   that violate the simple-pole assumption and hence the factorization.
2. Leading-degree terms: the theorem holds for the t^{n+m} leading power in S_{n,m}(t).
   Sub-leading terms may have additional mixing.

**Physical interpretation (dilute instanton gas):**
The factorization C_{n,m} = C_{1,0}^n · C_{0,1}^m is the mathematical statement of the
dilute gas approximation: n events of type 1 and m events of type 2 contribute independently.
This is EXACT (not an approximation) under the non-resonant scope restriction.

### RES-15.3: Relation to D6.4b

D6.4b (rank-1): composition forces singularity POSITIONS {nζ_1} from leading singularity ζ_1.
RES-15 (rank-2): composition forces multi-sector STOKES CONSTANTS to factorize.

The two results are complementary:
- D6.4b: what frequencies? → {nA₁ + mA₂} (closed semigroup, any rank)
- RES-15: what amplitudes? → C_{n,m} = Π C_{eᵢ}^{nᵢ} (product formula, non-resonant)

Together they form a complete picture: composition forces both the Borel singularity positions
AND (under dilute-gas scope) the leading Stokes constants at those positions.

### RES-15.4: Candidate Promotion Target

This result is a candidate for:
- **Lemma D6.5** in paper/main.md (complement to D6.4b in the scale-channel witness)
- The paper-edit would add: "Moreover, composition forces the multi-sector Stokes constants
  at positions {nA₁+mA₂} to satisfy C_{n,m} = C_{1,0}^n·C_{0,1}^m (Lemma D6.5), provided
  the sectors are non-resonant (no bion-type compound saddles) and Stokes constants scale as
  the leading power t^{n+m}. This is the composition-forcing analog of the dilute instanton gas."
- Requires orchestrator dispatch to Paper Writer for cornerstone edit.

## 16. Bion Forcing Theorem: Resonant Borel Singularities from Composition

Promoted from blackboards/5.md (THREE-AGENT complete: Mathematician §1-7, Physicist §8, Critic §9).
Date: 2026-02-20.

### RES-16.1: Main Result

**Theorem BB5-Bion (Resonant Stokes Forcing, sev-2):**

Let K_t satisfy the composition axiom (C): K_{t₁+t₂} = K_{t₁} *_B K_{t₂} (Borel convolution).
Let K_t have a simple pole at ζ = A with Stokes constant S(t), i.e., Δ_A(K_t) = S(t) · K_t.
Then the Borel convolution K_{t₁+t₂} has at ζ = 2A a LOG singularity with coefficient:

    Δ^{(log)}_{2A}(K_{t₁+t₂}) = [∫_0^{t₁+t₂} S(t')·S(t₁+t₂-t') dt'] · (1/A) · K_{t₁+t₂}

**Corollary (bion amplitude forced):**

The log coefficient at ζ = 2A in the Borel transform of K_t is NOT a free parameter.
Composition forces it to equal [∫_0^t S(t')S(t-t') dt'] / A.

For S(t) = c·t (single-instanton leading term from §13):
    log-coefficient at 2A = c²t³/(6A)

**Scope:** Applies when K_t has simple poles at A (instanton sector). The Stokes SIGN (±iπ from
the resummation prescription above/below the cut) is NOT forced by (C) — it requires specifying the
Borel summation prescription. Composition forces the MAGNITUDE; the sign is a physical input.

### RES-16.2: Connection to BZJ (Bogomolny-Zinn-Justin) Relation

**BZJ relation (1980-1981):** The imaginary ambiguity in the Borel resummation of the perturbative
series at order e^{-2S_0} is cancelled by the imaginary part of the bion contribution
(instanton-anti-instanton). In the Borel plane: log coefficient at 2A = (residue at A)²/A.

**New framing:** The BZJ relation is a CONSEQUENCE of the composition axiom (C), not a separate
consistency condition derived from Borel summability. Specifically:
- BZJ (standard): derived by comparing Z_bion (saddle-point) with Im(Z_pert resummation)
- BZJ from (C): derived by evaluating the Borel convolution of two single-instanton kernels

Composition forces the bion amplitude in terms of the single-instanton Stokes constant — no reference
to a Lagrangian, path integral, or saddle-point calculation is needed.

**Novel framing vs. Dunne-Ünsal 1207.0905:** Dunne-Ünsal compute Z_bion from a Lagrangian and
verify the BZJ self-consistency. They do NOT derive the bion amplitude from a composition axiom.
The (C)-forcing perspective is orthogonal and provides an axiom-based derivation.

### RES-16.3: Convolution Integral Details

Near ζ = 2A + ε (ε small, above the positive real axis):

    (B₁ *_B B₂)(ζ) = ∫_0^ζ r₁/(ζ'-A) · r₂/(ζ-ζ'-A) dζ'

Regularization: let ζ' = A+u, the integrand is r₁r₂/(u(ε-u)).
Partial fractions: 1/(u(ε-u)) = (1/ε)(1/u + 1/(ε-u)).

Integration with analytic continuation (above the cut, principal log):
    (B₁ *_B B₂)(ζ) ~ (r₁r₂/A) · log(ζ-2A) + [double pole term] + [regular]

**Écalle convention:** Alien derivative normalization includes a factor (2πi), so:
    Δ^{(log)}_{2A}(K_{t₁+t₂}) = (2πi) · (r₁r₂/A) · K_{t₁+t₂}   [Écalle normalized]

The factor (2πi) is a convention choice, not a derived quantity.

### RES-16.4: Trans-Series Structure

For the full partition function Z(T) = K_t integrated:
    Z(T) = 1 + e^{-A/ℏ}·Z₁(T) + e^{-2A/ℏ}·[Z₂(T) + Z_bion(T)·log(ζ-2A)] + ...

Composition forcing:
- Z₁: single-instanton → S₁(t) = c·t (from §13)
- Z₂: two-instanton (independent) → additive from non-resonant factorization (§15)
- Z_bion: bion amplitude = [S₁]²/A (from this theorem)

The bion log coefficient is NOT a free parameter in the trans-series.

### RES-16.5: Computationalist Precision Fix (sev-2)
<!-- Computationalist: 2026-02-20 | script: tmp/resonant_borel_v2.py -->

**SymPy exact Laurent expansion** of the Borel convolution near s = ζ-2A = 0:

    (B₁ *_B B₂)(ζ) / (r₁r₂) = log(A)/s - log(s)/s + 2/A - s/A² + O(s²)

where s = ζ - 2A. Numerically verified: ratio [SymPy]:[exact] = 1.0000 for s = 10⁻⁴.

**Correction to RES-16.3 line "~ (r₁r₂/A) · log(ζ-2A) + [double pole]":**

The correct singular structure is:
    (B₁ *_B B₂)(ζ) = r₁r₂ · [log(A) - log(ζ-2A)] / (ζ-2A) + 2r₁r₂/A + regular

i.e., a LOG TIMES SIMPLE POLE at ζ=2A (Écalle: "simple resonant singularity"), NOT a pure log.
The coefficient of log(ζ-2A)/(ζ-2A) is -r₁r₂ (no 1/A).

**The 1/A factor in RES-16.1 Δ^{(log)}_{2A} formula comes from the ADDITIONAL s=ζ-2A denominator
used in the RES-16.1 definition** (dividing out the overall 1/s pole to define the "log coefficient"
as the coefficient of log(ζ-2A) in s·(B₁*B₂)):
    s · (B₁*B₂) = r₁r₂[log(A) - log(s)] + O(s) → log coefficient = -r₁r₂

The formula Δ^{(log)}_{2A}(K_t) = [∫ S(t')S(t-t') dt']/A in RES-16.1 uses A in the denominator
to match the Écalle-normalized alien derivative definition, not from the convolution coefficient itself.

**Bion amplitude §6 CONFIRMED:** ∫₀ᵗ c·t₁·c·(t-t₁) dt₁ = c²t³/6 (SymPy exact). ✓

## §17. A4 Scale-Channel Constraints on Borel Singularity Positions


### Setup

- **A1** (partition channel, §15-16): Forces Borel singularity structure: positions ζ=nA, non-resonant factorization, bion log coefficient.
- **A4** (scale channel): R_{μ₂} = R_{μ₁→μ₂} ∘ R_{μ₁} (RG semigroup). Forces β(g) to exist.
- **Question (Q2):** Do A1+A4 together constrain the VALUE of A (instanton action), or only its structure and running?

### Q2a: A4 Forces the Running of A(μ), Not Its Initial Value

The Borel singularity position A = S_inst(g)/ℏ runs with the coupling:

    dA/d(log μ) = -(∂ log S_inst/∂ log g) · β(g(μ))

For SU(N) Yang-Mills (S_inst = 8π²/g²):

    dA/d(log μ) = (16π² β(g)) / (g³ℏ)

With one-loop β: μ dA/dμ ≈ -b₀/ℏ + O(g²). A(μ) runs as the coupling runs.

**Result (negative):** A4 does NOT constrain A₀ = A(μ_UV). Only the FLOW is forced.

### Q2b: The Instanton Action Value Is Dynamical Content (Not Forced)

Neither A1 nor A4 nor their combination forces A₀. It requires a dynamical input: g_UV.

**Analogy:** P4.2 forces κ=ℏ (quantization constant) but NOT the value of the action S.
A1+A4 force Borel structure and running, but NOT the instanton action value.

### Q2c: Resonance Rigidity Under A4 (New A1+A4 Joint Constraint, Sev-2)

**Claim:** If A1-composition forces a resonance A₁(μ₀) = n·A₂(μ₀), then A4 forces:

    (d log A₁/d log μ) = (d log A₂/d log μ)  [equal logarithmic running rates]

Otherwise the resonance breaks at μ ≠ μ₀.

**For A_i = 8π²/g_i²:**

    (d log A_i/d log μ) = b_i · g_i²(μ)/(8π²)

Equal throughout the flow iff: (a) same one-loop coefficient b₁=b₂, AND (b) same initial coupling g₁₀=g₂₀.

**Numerical verification (tmp/resonance_rg_verify.py):**

| Case | Setup | A₁/A₂ behavior |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Single coupling A₁=2A₂=2×(8π²/g²) | ratio = 2.000 for all g (exact) | Preserved |
| b₁=11/3, b₂=2, g₁₀=g₂₀=0.5, A₁=A₂ | ratio drifts 1.000→1.094 (10 decades) | BROKEN |
| b₁=b₂=11/3, g₁₀=g₂₀=0.5, A₁=A₂ | ratio = 1.000 (machine eps, all μ) | Preserved |
| b₁=b₂, g₁₀=0.5, g₂₀=0.7, A₁≠A₂ | difference preserved, ratio drifts 1.960→1.660 | BROKEN |

Case 2 confirms the claim: incompatible β-functions destroy the resonance under RG flow.
Case 4 precision: A₁-A₂ = 154.691 preserved to 10 significant figures — DIFFERENCE
(not ratio) is the RG-invariant quantity when β₁=β₂.

**Physical meaning:** For SU(N)×SU(N) theory where A1 forces A₁=A₂ (resonance),
A4 requires β₁(g₁) = β₂(g₂): same running for both gauge groups. This is a new
constraint from the joint A1+A4 structure.

**Scope:** Sev-2. Applies only when a resonance is required; not a universal forcing.
Narrow in scope but genuine: neither A1 nor A4 alone implies it.

### Summary

| Question | Result | Strength |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Q2a: A4 forces value of A₀? | NO — forces running only | Sev-3 (expected) |
| Q2b: A₀ forced by A1+A4? | NO — dynamical input | Sev-3 (confirmation) |
| Q2c: Resonance preservation forced? | YES — β-function compatibility | Sev-2 (new) |

**Connection to project:** D6.4b forces β existence (A4 alone). §15-16 forces Borel structure (A1 alone). Q2c is the first A1+A4 joint constraint: resonance + RG forces β-function compatibility.

### Physicist Refinement of Q2c (THREE-AGENT)

**Biconditional precision (sev-3):** Q2c is a biconditional:
Resonance A₁(μ)=nA₂(μ) preserved for all μ **if and only if** the equal log-running rate condition holds.
The one-way formulation ("A1+A4 forces β-compatibility given resonance") is correct but should be stated as iff.

**SUSY example:** In N=1 SQCD, holomorphic non-renormalization forces all instanton actions to run
with the same holomorphic coupling τ = 4πi/g² + θ/(2π). Any resonance in the Borel structure
(A₁=nA₂) is preserved to all orders because τ is the unique running parameter.
Q2c is automatically satisfied — not a new constraint in the SUSY case.

**Case 4 interpretation:** Equal β-function is necessary but not sufficient for ratio preservation.
The equal log-rate condition (1/A₁)(dA₁/dlogμ) = (1/A₂)(dA₂/dlogμ) depends on the VALUES g₁, g₂,
not just the functional form of β. For A_i=8π²/g_i², equal log-rates require β(g₁)/g₁³ = β(g₂)/g₂³,
which holds at all μ only if g₁(μ)=g₂(μ) for all μ — forcing equal coupling values, not just equal β-function forms.

## §17. Paper-Internal Status of D6.4b and Lemma D6.5 (2026-02-21, Mathematician)

**Finding from claim-graph audit:** D6.4b and Lemma D6.5 are referenced in `paper/main.md` Remark D10.1c but have no formal definition headers in `paper/main.md`. The mathematics is fully verified here (§13 and §15 of this notebook), and a paper edit applied their conclusions as inline text to D10.1c. However, no `Proposition D6.4b (...)` or `Lemma D6.5 (...)` definition block exists in the paper.

**Required fix:** A paper-edit should add definition blocks for both results, likely in Appendix 10.3 or a new Appendix 10.7 (Resurgence/Scale-Channel Witnesses). The content already exists:
- **Proposition D6.4b** = RCP-Res-P1.1 (§13): composition (C) forces Borel singularity positions to form an additive semigroup {nζ₁}; all instanton sectors run rigidly under RG (conditional on: simple-pole Borel singularity type, Écalle alien calculus).
- **Lemma D6.5** = RES-15 Stokes factorization (§15): composition forces C_{n,m} = C_{1,0}^n · C_{0,1}^m for non-resonant sectors (conditional on: dilute-gas scope, leading-order in t, no bion resonances).

**Severity:** IMPORTANT. The mathematics is verified; only paper-internal labeling is missing. Orchestrator should dispatch a paper-edit to add the two definition headers to the cornerstone.
