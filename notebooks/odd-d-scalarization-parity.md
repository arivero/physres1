# Odd-d Scalarization: Parity Obstruction and Transmutation Witnesses

**Created:** 2026-02-14
**Source:** Blackboard 0 (D27/S284)
**Status:** Append-only notebook (graduated from blackboards)

## Summary

Half-density scalarization in dimension d requires a reference half-density σ_* carrying dimension [length]^{d/2}. This notebook establishes:

1. **Parity lemma:** The monomial sieve (building σ_* from integer powers of fundamental couplings) is an **even-d filter**. For odd d, half-integer d/2 is categorically unreachable via integer-dimensional couplings.

2. **Transmutation escape:** The transmutation route (PA-H2.13) is **parity-blind**. Any marginal/relevant coupling generating an RG-invariant scale Λ_* (dimension [length]^{−1}) supplies Λ_*^{−d/2} with correct dimension for any d.

3. **d = 3 witness:** The 3D delta interaction generates scattering length a (dimension [length]) via power-law renormalization. The scalarization constant a^{3/2} = [length]^{3/2} is well-defined, demonstrating odd-d transmutation without fractional coupling powers.

**Impact:** The claim "d=4 is selected by the monomial sieve" (Planck-area note PA-D1.3) should be stated precisely as: "among even d with gravity-only coupling, d=4 is uniquely selected." Odd d is blocked by parity, not by gravity's specific dimension.

## 1. Setup: Half-Density Scalarization

### Context

Half-density formalism (PA-H2.2 + PA-H2.3) represents quantum states as sections of a half-density bundle. Scalarization (converting half-density to scalar for coordinate calculations) requires a reference half-density:
```
σ_* ~ L_*^{−d/2} |dx|^{1/2}
```
where L_* is a length scale with dimension [length], so σ_* has dimension [length]^{d/2}.

### Two Routes (PA-H2 hypothesis structure)

**Monomial sieve (PA-H2.5a):**
Build L_* as a monomial ∏ gᵢ^{nᵢ} with integer exponents nᵢ from admitted couplings gᵢ (whose length dimensions are integers).

**Transmutation (PA-H2.13):**
Extract L_* from RG-invariant scales generated by marginal/relevant couplings (e.g., Λ_QCD in QCD, scattering length a in contact interactions).

---

## 2. Parity Lemma

### Statement

**Parity Lemma.** If all admitted couplings {gᵢ} have integer length dimensions [gᵢ] = [length]^{aᵢ} with aᵢ ∈ ℤ, then any monomial ∏ gᵢ^{nᵢ} with integer exponents nᵢ ∈ ℤ has integer length dimension Σ nᵢaᵢ ∈ ℤ.

**Proof.** ℤ is closed under integer linear combinations: Σ nᵢaᵢ ∈ ℤ when aᵢ, nᵢ ∈ ℤ. QED.

### Consequence for Half-Integer Targets

For odd d, the target dimension d/2 is **half-integer** (not in ℤ). The parity lemma guarantees it is unreachable via the monomial sieve.

**This obstruction is categorical:** adding more integer-dimensional couplings (Λ_d, extra scalars, etc.) cannot overcome parity. The problem is structural, not a matter of insufficient coupling diversity.

## 3. Standard Coupling Dimension Table

| Coupling | [.] = [length]^a | a for d=1 | d=2 | d=3 | d=4 | d=5 |
|----------|------------------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| G_d (Newton constant) | [length]^{d−2} | −1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Λ_d (cosmological) | [length]^{−2} | −2 | −2 | −2 | −2 | −2 |
| g_d² (Yang-Mills action) | [length]^{d−4} | −3 | −2 | −1 | 0 | 1 |
| m (mass, c=ℏ=1) | [length]^{−1} | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 | −1 |
| α_* (area parameter) | [length]^2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |

**All entries are integers.** The parity lemma applies universally.

### Note on Unsquared YM Coupling

The unsquared gauge coupling g_d has [g_d] = [length]^{(d−4)/2}, which is **half-integer for odd d**. However, g_d is NOT an admitted coupling under PA-H2.7a. The action contains 1/(4g_d²), so the admitted parameter is g_d². Using g_d directly would require √(g_d²), violating the analyticity hypothesis PA-H2.5a.

### Dimension-by-Dimension Analysis

#### d = 1: Quantum mechanics on the line

Required scale: [length]^{1/2}. **Parity-blocked** under monomial sieve.

Standard 1D QM has dimensionful couplings {m, ℏ}, both with integer length dimensions. The 1D delta potential V(x) = g·δ(x) is exactly solvable without renormalization (Remark 4.2 of delta-objects note), so no transmutation occurs.

**Scale supplier:** Requires external input or fractional powers (neither available under PA-H2 hypotheses).

#### d = 2: The marginal/transmutation dimension

Required scale: [length]^1. Integer, so parity obstruction is absent.

But G₂ is **dimensionless**, so gravity provides no scale under monomial sieve.

**Transmutation witness:** The 2D delta interaction generates κ_* (dimension [length]^{−1}) via β ~ g_R² (PA-E5, Jackiw's marginal running). The scalarization constant is:
```
σ_* ~ κ_*^{−1} = [length]^1 = [length]^{d/2}
```

This is the canonical transmutation witness. The 2D delta is **marginal** (logarithmic running), generating an RG-invariant scale dynamically.

#### d = 3: Parity-blocked, but transmutation via scattering length

Required scale: [length]^{3/2}. Half-integer: **parity-blocked**.

**Transmutation witness:** The 3D delta interaction generates a **scattering length** a (dimension [length]) via power-law renormalization (Remark 4.2, Jackiw; Derezinski rigorous treatment). The scalarization constant is:
```
σ_* ~ a^{3/2} = [length]^{3/2} = [length]^{d/2}
```

**Key subtlety:** Is a^{3/2} "non-analytic" in the sense of PA-H2.5?

The transmutation scale a is already non-analytic in the bare coupling (it requires renormalization — the bare coupling is not a well-defined parameter). Taking a^{3/2} adds no qualitatively new non-analyticity. The function x ↦ x^{3/2} is smooth on (0, ∞), and a > 0 is a positive real number (the physical scattering length).

**The "fractional power" concern of PA-H2.5 applies to couplings, not to derived physical scales.** Since a is an RG-invariant observable (not a coupling), a^{3/2} is well-defined.

**Physical model:** Free Hamiltonian H₀ = −ℏ²/(2m)∇² on ℝ³ with point interaction at origin. Self-adjoint extension parametrized by scattering length a (dimension [length]) via:
```
(−∇² + α·δ(x))  regularized
```
Power-law renormalization relates bare α to physical a. Bound state (for a > 0):
```
E = −ℏ²/(2ma²)
```

Scalarization: Identity kernel in half-density language scales as ε^{−3/2}δ(v)|dx|^{1/2}|dv|^{1/2} near diagonal (Section 2 of delta-objects note). Scalar representative requires:
```
σ_* ~ L_*^{−3/2} |dx|^{1/2}
```
with L_* = a, giving σ_* ~ a^{−3/2}|dx|^{1/2}.

**This is the odd-d transmutation witness:** a^{3/2} = [length]^{3/2} supplied by RG-invariant contact datum, requiring no fractional powers of fundamental couplings.

#### d = 4: The unique monomial-sieve pass

Required scale: [length]^2. Integer: parity obstruction absent.

Newton constant: [G₄] = [length]² = [length]^{d/2}. The monomial k = 1 works:
```
σ_* ~ G₄^{−1/2} |dx|^{1/2}
```

This is the content of Derivation PA-D1.3 (Planck-area note).

**Transmutation also works:** In d=4 QCD, Λ_QCD has dimension [length]^{−1}. Therefore:
```
Λ_QCD^{−2} = [length]^2 = [length]^{d/2}
```

Both routes available. Gravity monomial sieve selects d=4 among **even** dimensions.

#### d = 5: Parity-blocked, transmutation limited

Required scale: [length]^{5/2}. Half-integer: **parity-blocked**.

Yang-Mills in d=5: [g₅²] = [length] (super-renormalizable, not asymptotically free). Standard transmutation does not apply (no RG-invariant scale from perturbative running).

Gravity: [G₅] = [length]³ (integer), but G₅^{5/6} is needed — fractional power of a coupling, violating PA-H2.5a.

**Scale supplier:** Requires either fractional coupling powers, non-perturbative UV completion, or extra area parameter α_* (but α_*^{5/4} is again fractional).

---

## 5. Transmutation Route Is Parity-Blind

### Claim

If a transmutation scale Λ_* exists (dimension [length]^{−1}), then:
```
Λ_*^{−d/2} = [length]^{d/2}
```
for **any** d (integer or not).

### Proof

Λ_* is a positive real number with dimension [length]^{−1}. The function x ↦ x^{−d/2} is smooth on (0, ∞) for all real d/2. Therefore Λ_*^{−d/2} is well-defined and carries dimension [length]^{d/2}.

No "fractional power of a coupling" is involved because Λ_* is not a coupling — it is a **derived RG-invariant scale** (e.g., Λ_QCD in QCD, κ_* in 2D delta, scattering length a in 3D delta).

QED.

### Contrast with Monomial Sieve

The parity obstruction is **specific to the monomial sieve** (PA-H2.5a), where integer-exponent monomials in integer-dimensional couplings can only reach integer length dimensions.

Transmutation bypasses this by generating a physical scale Λ_* dynamically (via RG flow), then raising it to any real power. The hypothesis PA-H2.5 (analyticity/no fractional powers) applies to **couplings**, not to derived observables.

---

## 6. Physical Witness: The 3D Delta Interaction

### Model

Free Hamiltonian on ℝ³:
```
H₀ = −ℏ²/(2m)∇²
```

Point interaction at origin modeled via self-adjoint extension. Standard parametrization: scattering length a (dimension [length]).

### Renormalization (Power-Law)

Bare coupling α (dimension [length]²) relates to physical scattering length via:
```
1/a = (cutoff dependence) + (finite renormalized part)
```

In d=3, this is **power-law renormalization** (Jackiw, Derezinski). The theory is not perturbatively renormalizable (coupling relevant), but self-adjoint extensions are rigorously classified by the scattering length.

### Bound State

For a > 0 (attractive interaction):
```
E = −ℏ²/(2ma²)
ψ(r) ~ e^{−r/a}/r
```

The scattering length a is an RG-invariant observable characterizing the contact interaction.

### Scalarization Constant

Half-density kernel near diagonal (Section 2 of delta-objects note):
```
K_Id ~ ε^{−d/2} δ(v) |dx|^{1/2} |dv|^{1/2}
```

For d=3: ε^{−3/2}. Scalar representative requires reference half-density:
```
σ_* ~ L_*^{−3/2} |dx|^{1/2}
```

Setting L_* = a (the scattering length), the scalarization constant is:
```
a^{3/2} = [length]^{3/2} = [length]^{d/2}
```

**This is well-defined:** a > 0 is a positive real number, and x ↦ x^{3/2} is smooth on (0, ∞).

**No fractional coupling power:** a is not a coupling; it is a derived physical observable. The half-integer power is taken of the **RG-invariant scale**, not of a fundamental parameter.

---

## 7. Conclusion

### Monomial Sieve Is Even-d Only

The monomial sieve (PA-H2.5a) is an **even-d filter**. Odd d is categorically blocked by parity (half-integer d/2 unreachable via integer-dimensional couplings with integer exponents).

This obstruction is structural: adding more integer-dimensional couplings (Λ_d, extra scalars, etc.) cannot overcome it.

### Transmutation Is Parity-Blind

The transmutation branch (PA-H2.13) is **parity-blind**: if a marginal/relevant coupling generates an RG-invariant scale Λ_* (dimension [length]^{−1}), then Λ_*^{−d/2} has the correct dimension [length]^{d/2} for **any** d.

Odd d is equally accessible via transmutation where marginal/relevant couplings exist:
- d = 2: marginal (2D delta, κ_*)
- d = 3: relevant (3D delta, scattering length a)

### d = 4 Selection (Precise Statement)

For the Planck-area note, the claim "d=4 is selected by the monomial sieve" (PA-D1.3) should be stated as:

**"Among even d with gravity-only coupling, d=4 is uniquely selected by the monomial sieve."**

Two separate conditions:
1. **Integrality hypothesis (PA-H2.5a):** Only integer powers allowed.
2. **Even parity of d:** Required for integer d/2.

The sieve's selectivity depends on both. Odd d is blocked by parity, not by gravity's specific dimension.

### d = 3 Witness

The 3D delta interaction provides the cleanest **odd-d transmutation witness**:
- Scattering length a = [length] (RG-invariant contact datum)
- Scalarization constant a^{3/2} = [length]^{3/2}
- No fractional coupling powers required (power is taken of derived scale, not coupling)

This demonstrates that odd-d scalarization is possible via transmutation, complementing the even-d monomial route.
