# d=4 b-Calculus and the Planck Area: Extension of the Half-Density Unification

## 1. Motivation

BB3 (promoted, 2026-02-20) established: for d=2, the b-measure dm_b = r^{-1} dr dθ produces
b-half-density = r^{-1}|d²x|^{1/2} = P4.2 σ_* = planck-area σ_* [three-way unification].

**Question:** Does this extend to d=4 (relevant for the Planck area program)?

## 2. b-Calculus in d Dimensions (Physicist Calculation)

b-calculus on (M,∂M) = (ℝ^d\{0}, S^{d-1}) with radial blow-up at origin:

Polar coordinates: d^d x = r^{d-1} dr dΩ_{d-1}
b-vector fields: r∂_r (normal), ∂_{θᵢ} (tangential)
b-measure: dm_b = d(log r) · dΩ_{d-1} = (dr/r) · dΩ_{d-1}

Ratio to Lebesgue: dm_b / d^d x = (r^{-1} dr dΩ_{d-1}) / (r^{d-1} dr dΩ_{d-1}) = r^{-d}
So: dm_b = r^{-d} d^d x

b-Hilbert space L²_b: ∫|f|² dm_b < ∞ ↔ ∫|f|² r^{-d} d^d x < ∞
Intertwiner L²_b ↔ L²(d^d x): f ↔ r^{-d/2} f
b-half-density: |dm_b|^{1/2} = r^{-d/2} |d^d x|^{1/2}

## 3. Three-Way Unification Holds in All d

| Quantity | d=2 | d=4 | General d |
|----------|-----|-----|-----------|
| b-half-density | r^{-1}|d²x|^{1/2} | r^{-2}|d⁴x|^{1/2} | r^{-d/2}|d^dx|^{1/2} |
| P4.2 σ_* | r^{-1}|d²x|^{1/2} | r^{-2}|d⁴x|^{1/2} | r^{-d/2}|d^dx|^{1/2} |
| planck-area σ_* | — | C·L_P^{-2}·|d⁴x|^{1/2} | — |

For d=4: b-half-density = r^{-2}|d⁴x|^{1/2} matches σ_* = r^{-d/2} = r^{-2}. CONSISTENT.

The Planck length enters as: r ~ L_P → r^{-2} ~ L_P^{-2} [the Planck inverse area scale].
So near r = L_P: b-half-density ≈ L_P^{-2}|d⁴x|^{1/2} = planck-area σ_*.

## 4. Bound State Structure in d Dimensions (Corrected by Mathematician §10)

**d=2 (special case):** indicial roots α = ±(d-2)/2 = 0 (double root).
Log solution ψ ~ ln(κ_* r): L²_b-integrable since ∫_0^1 (ln r)² r^{-1} dr = 2 < ∞. ✓
This is the source of the logarithmic bound state in the 2D delta model.

**d=4 (corrected):** indicial roots α = ±1.
- ψ_+ ~ r^{+1}: L²_b-integrable (α>0). ✓
- ψ_- ~ r^{-1}: ∫_0^1 r^{-3} dr DIVERGES — NOT in L²_b(ℝ⁴). ✗

**General d:** b-Laplacian indicial roots α = ±(d-2)/2.
L²_b integrability near r=0: ∫_0^1 r^{2α} · r^{-1} dr converges iff α > 0.
Only ψ_+ ~ r^{+(d-2)/2} is L²_b-normalizable for d≥3.
The d=2 case is exceptional: both roots coincide (α=0), producing the log solution.

**Consequence:** For d≥3, contact interactions in the b-calculus framework require
a different mechanism for bound states (deficiency indices, self-adjoint extension
of the b-Laplacian restricted to S-wave states). The d=4 parallel to the 2D log
bound state does NOT arise from ψ ~ r^{-1}.

## 5. Connection to the Planck Scale

The physical interpretation: the b-groupoid G_b of ℝ⁴ blown up at r=0 models a theory where:
- Distances r > L_P: physics is approximately standard (L²(d⁴x) behavior)
- Distances r ~ L_P: the b-measure weight r^{-4} dominates; L²_b is the correct Hilbert space
- Distances r → 0: the blow-up replaces the origin with S³ (the "quantum of area" boundary)

**This is a mathematical model of regularity near r=0:** The blown-up manifold ℝ⁴\{0} ~ ℝ_+ × S³ with the b-measure replaces the origin with S³ as a minimal boundary. Its physical interpretation as Planck-scale discretization would require additional dynamical input beyond dimensional analysis.

## 6. Connection to PA-H4.1 (Misner Measure)

PA-H4.1: half-density resolves the Misner measure in minisuperspace (ℝ_+ with scale factor a):
σ_*(a) ~ a^{-d/2} |da|^{1/2} for the minisuperspace measure a^{d-1} da.

b-measure in minisuperspace: dm_b = d(log a) = a^{-1} da → |dm_b|^{1/2} = a^{-1/2}|da|^{1/2}.

For minisuperspace d_eff = 2 (effectively 2 real degrees of freedom in minisuperspace):
σ_*(a) = a^{-1}|da|^{1/2} = |dm_b|^{1/2} ✓

The minisuperspace resolution is a special case of the d=2 b-calculus unification.
The full superspace obstruction (infinite-dimensional, requires regularization) is the d→∞ limit.

## 7. Proposed New Proposition

**Proposition B-HD-P1.1 (b-half-density naturally implements σ_*):**

For any d, the b-groupoid G_b of ℝ^d blown up at the origin has b-measure dm_b = r^{-d} d^d x.
The b-half-density |dm_b|^{1/2} = r^{-d/2}|d^d x|^{1/2} naturally implements the half-density
σ_* of P4.2's composition law (Proposition PA-P1.2). Consequently:
(i) The C*-algebra C*(G_b) acts on the L²_b Hilbert space that implements P4.2's
    half-density normalization algebraically (no additional postulate needed).
(ii) In d=4, σ_* = C · r^{-2} |d⁴x|^{1/2} → near r = L_P, this is the Planck-area half-density.
(iii) For d=2: bound states of contact interactions live in L²_b (log solution, not L²(d²x)).
     For d≥3: the L²_b self-adjoint extension question is more subtle; ψ ~ r^{-(d-2)/2}
     is NOT L²_b-normalizable. The correct Hilbert space for d≥3 contact interactions
     requires deficiency-index analysis.

## 8. Status

THREE-AGENT COMPLETE: Physicist (§1-8) + Critic (§9) + Mathematician (§10).
Severity: sev-3. §2-3 + table safe to reference. §4 error corrected above.
Sev-2 corrections applied: (B-HD-S2.1) "universal"→"naturally implements"; (B-HD-S2.2) discretization claim softened; (§4) ψ ~ r^{-1} NOT in L²_b(ℝ⁴) — corrected.
Do NOT promote §4's d=4 bound state claim. §2-3 general formula: safe for planck-area footnote.

## 9. Critic Assessment
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-20 -->

**Reviewing §1-8: Is B-HD-P1.1 significant or straightforward?**

### Verdict: CORRECT but STRAIGHTFORWARD. Not a new proposition — it is a parametric extension.

**The math is correct:** b-measure dm_b = r^{-d} d^d x and b-half-density = r^{-d/2} |d^d x|^{1/2} in arbitrary d. The match with P4.2's sigma_* = r^{-d/2} is automatic from the definition of b-calculus. No new mathematical content is needed; the d=2 result trivially extends because the b-calculus formula is the SAME in all d.

**What B-HD-P1.1 actually says:** "The b-half-density matches the P4.2 half-density for all d." But this is definitional: P4.2 forces sigma_* = t^{-d/2} (composition), and the b-calculus gives dm_b^{1/2} = r^{-d/2} (blow-up at origin). Both have exponent -d/2 because both are half-densities. The match is structural, not a coincidence requiring explanation.

**The d=4 Planck area connection (§5) is speculative.** Setting r ~ L_P and getting r^{-2} ~ L_P^{-2} is dimensional analysis, not a derivation. The "microscopic model of spatial discretization" claim is premature.

### Two sev-2 items

**B-HD-S2.1** (§7, line 79): "universal sigma_*" — "universal" overclaims what is really a DEFINITION. The b-half-density IS the half-density; they are the same object named differently. Remove "universal" or replace with "the b-half-density naturally implements".

**B-HD-S2.2** (§5, line 61): "microscopic model of spatial discretization at the Planck scale" — this is a claim about physics that requires far more than dimensional analysis. The blow-up replaces the origin with S^{d-1}, but this is a MATHEMATICAL regularity, not a physical discretization. The connection to Planck-scale physics is an interpretation, not a result. **Fix:** "mathematical model of regularity near r=0 whose physical interpretation as Planck-scale structure would require additional dynamical input."

### Promotion recommendation

**Sev-3 confirmed.** The d-dimensional extension is routine. The d=4 Planck connection is speculative. Not worth a paper-edit unless the speculative §5 is developed further with actual physical content (e.g., bound state spectrum in 4D, comparison to known Planck area results).

**However:** The d=2 three-way unification (already promoted from BB3) IS significant. This d=4 extension is a natural footnote to that result, not an independent proposition.

### Status: TWO-AGENT (physicist + critic). Awaiting mathematician for §2-4 verification.

## 10. Mathematician Verification of §2-4
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-20 -->

### Check §2-3: b-measure in d dimensions — CORRECT

b-measure: dm_b = d(log r)·dΩ_{d-1} = r^{-1} dr·dΩ_{d-1}.
Lebesgue: d^d x = r^{d-1} dr·dΩ_{d-1}.
Ratio: dm_b/d^d x = r^{-1}/r^{d-1} = r^{-d}. ✓
b-Hilbert space L²_b: ∫|f|² r^{-d} d^d x < ∞ ↔ intertwiner f ↔ r^{-d/2} f. ✓
b-half-density: |dm_b|^{1/2} = r^{-d/2}|d^d x|^{1/2}. ✓

Table in §3 (b-half-density = P4.2 σ_* for all d): CORRECT, for reasons Critic §9 identifies — both are half-densities, same exponent by definition.

### Check §4: d=4 bound state integrability — ERROR FOUND

**Physicist's claim:** ψ ~ r^{-1} and ψ ~ r^{-1} ln r "are in L²_b(ℝ⁴)."

**Correction:** This is FALSE. The b-Laplacian indicial equation gives ψ ~ r^{±(d-2)/2}, and:

L²_b integrability near r=0: ∫_0^1 |r^α|² dm_b = ∫_0^1 r^{2α} · r^{-1} dr = ∫_0^1 r^{2α-1} dr
converges iff 2α-1 > -1, i.e., α > 0.

For d=4 (α = ±1):
- ψ_+ ~ r^{+1} (α=+1): L²_b-integrable near r=0 ✓
- ψ_- ~ r^{-1} (α=-1): ∫_0^1 r^{-3} dr → DIVERGES ✗

**The d=4 solutions with α = -1 are NOT in L²_b(ℝ⁴).** The physicist confused the Euclidean L²(d⁴x) behavior with L²_b behavior.

**The d=2 case is special:** α = 0 for both solutions, giving ψ ~ ln r (log solution) which IS in L²_b:
∫_0^1 (ln r)^2 r^{-1} dr = ∫_0^∞ u^2 e^{-u} du = 2 < ∞ (substitution r = e^{-u}). ✓

The d=2 case works because the double root at α=0 produces the log solution, and log r ∈ L²_b despite log r ∉ L²(d²x).

**Correct general statement for §4:**
In d dimensions, the b-Laplacian indicial roots are α = ±(d-2)/2. Only the root α = +(d-2)/2 gives L²_b-integrable solutions near r=0 (for d≥2). The root α = -(d-2)/2 is excluded by L²_b except when d=2 (where both roots coincide at α=0 and the log solution is L²_b).

Consequence for B-HD-P1.1 part (iii): The d≥3 contact interaction in b-calculus does NOT have bound states from the negative-exponent solutions. The L²_b framework for contact interactions in d=4 needs a different mechanism (e.g., deficiency indices, self-adjoint extension of the b-Laplacian restricted to S-wave).

### Verdict on B-HD-P1.1

§2-3: CORRECT (parametric extension, as Critic noted).
§4: ERROR — ψ ~ r^{-1} is NOT in L²_b(ℝ⁴). The d=4 bound state claim is wrong.
§5-6: Speculative (as Critic noted); unaffected by the §4 error.
§7 (Proposition): Parts (i) and (ii) CORRECT. Part (iii) needs correction: "L²_b is correct for d=2 contact interactions; for d≥3 the self-adjoint extension question is more subtle."

Sev-2 correction: §4 has a mathematical error that could propagate to any paper relying on it.

Three-agent rule: Physicist (§1-8) + Critic (§9) + Mathematician (§10). THREE-AGENT COMPLETE.
Status: §4 error identified. Do NOT promote §4's claim. §2-3 + table: safe to reference.
