# V_HD on Compact Lie Groups: Constancy and Values

## §1. Setup

\(G\) compact Lie group, dim \(G = d\), bi-invariant metric \(g\) (Killing form, rescaled).

Laplace-Beltrami: \(\Delta_g\) (negative semidefinite convention).

Half-density Hamiltonian: \(\widetilde{H} = |g|^{1/4}(-\Delta_g)|g|^{-1/4} = H_L + V_{\mathrm{HD}}\)

where \(H_L = -\Delta_g\) (left ordering) and \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})\).

## §2. Constancy Theorem

**Proposition M0.1.** On a compact Lie group \(G\) with bi-invariant Riemannian metric, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant.

**Proof sketch:**
1. Bi-invariant metric \(\Rightarrow\) \(|g|\) is bi-invariant (constant in any left-invariant frame).
2. \(|g|^{-1/4}\) is a bi-invariant density \(\Rightarrow\) \(\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})\) is bi-invariant.
3. Bi-invariant function on \(G\) acting on itself \(\Rightarrow\) constant (by irreducibility of \(G/\{e\}\) under \(G \times G\)).

Alternative (direct): In left-invariant orthonormal frame \(\{e_i\}\),
\(|g| = 1\) (the frame diagonalizes the metric to identity).
Then \(|g|^{-1/4} = 1\), so \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -\Delta_g(1) = 0\).

**WARNING:** This argument shows \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = 0\) in left-invariant frame coordinates, NOT in geodesic polar coordinates. The two give different operators because the coordinate transformation is nonlinear.

## §3. Coordinate Dependence

The half-density conjugation is coordinate-dependent when expressed via \(|g|\).

**In left-invariant coordinates** (exponential map from Lie algebra):
- \(|g(0)| = 1\) at identity, but \(|g(x)| \neq 1\) away from identity.
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(x) = -|g(x)|^{1/4}\Delta_g(|g(x)|^{-1/4})\) is NOT trivially zero.
- However, by bi-invariance + Prop M0.1, it IS constant.

**In geodesic polar coordinates** \((r, \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_{d-1})\):
- For \(S^d\) (constant curvature): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) has been computed (BB4, BB6).
- For general \(G\): the radial density involves the root system.

## §4. SU(2) Verification

\(\mathrm{SU}(2) \cong S^3\). Round metric with \(R = 6/a^2\) (unit sphere: \(a=1\), \(R=6\)).

**Geodesic polar coords** on \(S^3\): \(ds^2 = dr^2 + \sin^2 r\,(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\,d\phi^2)\).

From BB4 general formula: \(\alpha = (d-1)/2 = 1\).
\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = \alpha(\alpha-1)/\sin^2 r - \alpha^2 = 0 - 1 = -1\). **Constant.** (FOUR-AGENT verified.)

**Lie-theoretic:** Weyl vector \(\rho = \alpha_1/2\), \(|\rho|^2 = 1/4\) (Killing norm, long root \(|\alpha|^2=2\)).

Peter-Weyl: \(-\Delta_{S^3}\) eigenvalues \(= 4\,C_2(j) = 4j(j+1) = l(l+2)\), \(l = 2j\).

Shift: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1 = -4|\rho|^2\). Freudenthal-de Vries: \(|\rho|^2 = \dim(G)/12 = 3/12 = 1/4\). **MATCH.**

## §5. General Compact \(G\): Value Formula

For compact semisimple \(G\) with bi-invariant metric (Killing form, long root \(|\alpha|^2 = 2\)):

**Conjecture M0.2.** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|\rho|^2 \cdot (\text{normalization factor})\), where \(\rho\) is the Weyl vector.

For SU(2): factor = 4. Why? \(-\Delta_{S^3}\) eigenvalue = \(4\,C_2(j)\) because Killing form normalization gives \(\mathrm{Ric} = (1/4)g_{\mathrm{Killing}}\) for SU(2), so \(R = d/4 = 3/4\) in Killing norm...

**ISSUE:** The Killing form on SU(2) gives \(R_{\mathrm{Killing}} = d/4 = 3/4\), but the round \(S^3\) with \(R=6\) uses a DIFFERENT normalization (\(g = -8\,g_{\mathrm{Killing}}\) for unit sphere). The factor of 4 is an artifact of the particular metric normalization.

**Safe statement (avoiding normalization tangles):**

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/(4 \cdot 2) = -R/8\) on \(S^3\) with round metric (\(R=6\): \(-6/8\) ??? = \(-3/4 \neq -1\)).

This does NOT match. The correct formula for constant-curvature spaces is:
\[V_{\mathrm{HD,const}} = -\frac{(d-1)R}{4d}\]
For \(S^3\): \(-\frac{2 \cdot 6}{4 \cdot 3} = -1\). **CORRECT.**

## §6. Non-Constant-Curvature Lie Groups

\(G = \mathrm{SU}(3)\): \(d = 8\), NOT constant curvature (rank 2, two root lengths equal for SU but mixed curvatures).

For SU(3) with Killing metric: sectional curvatures are NOT constant.
The formula \(V_{\mathrm{HD,const}} = -(d-1)R/(4d)\) does NOT apply.

**However, by Prop M0.1, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is still constant.**

The VALUE on SU(3) requires explicit computation:
- In geodesic polar coords on SU(3), the volume density involves 6 positive roots.
- \(|g(r,\Omega)|^{1/2} \propto \prod_{\alpha \in \Phi^+} \frac{\sin(\alpha \cdot H \cdot r)}{|\alpha|}\) (Harish-Chandra formula for semisimple groups).
- For SU(3): \(\Phi^+ = \{e_1-e_2, e_1-e_3, e_2-e_3\}\), 3 positive roots.
- The half-density conjugation involves \(\Delta_g\) of \(|g|^{-1/4}\), which in the Harish-Chandra radial decomposition involves the Casimir of the adjoint rep.

**Expected value (unverified):**
\[V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\mathrm{SU}(3)) = -C_2(\mathrm{ad}_{\mathrm{SU}(3)}) \cdot (\text{metric normalization factor})\]
\(C_2(\mathrm{ad}_{\mathrm{SU}(3)}) = 3\) (adjoint Casimir for SU(3), Killing norm).

NEEDS COMPUTATIONAL VERIFICATION.

## §7. Rank-1 Symmetric Spaces (from desk reflection)

For rank-1 symmetric spaces in geodesic polar coords, root multiplicities \((a,b)\):
- \(S^d\): \((d-1, 0)\), \(\alpha = (d-1)/2\)
- \(\mathbb{CP}^n\): \((2(n-1), 1)\), \(\alpha = n\)
- \(\mathbb{HP}^n\): \((4(n-1), 3)\), \(\alpha = 2n+1\)
- \(\mathrm{Ca}P^2\): \((8, 7)\), \(\alpha = 11\)

Constancy condition: \(\alpha(\alpha-1) = 0\), i.e., \(\alpha \in \{0,1\}\).

Among spheres: \(d=3\) only (non-trivial). Among ALL rank-1: also \(\mathbb{CP}^1 \cong S^2\) in Fubini-Study coords (\(\alpha=1\)).

**Note:** \(\mathbb{CP}^1\) in FS coords gives constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\), but \(S^2\) in standard spherical coords does NOT (same manifold, different charts). Constancy is chart-dependent.

## §8. Paper Relevance

**Proposition candidate (for Appendix 10.2 or D9.1 remark):**

"On any compact Lie group \(G\) with bi-invariant metric, the half-density ordering potential \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant (Proposition M0.1). Among compact rank-1 symmetric spaces \(M = G/H\) in geodesic polar coordinates, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant only for \(S^3\) and \(H^3\) (non-trivially) and their quotients."

**Status:** Proposition M0.1 (constancy on Lie groups) is PROVED. The value for SU(3) needs COMPUTATIONAL VERIFICATION. Chart-dependence caveat is essential.

## §9. Intrinsic vs Coordinate V_HD (Critical Clarification)

**The half-density Laplacian \(\Delta_{1/2}\) is intrinsic** (well-defined operator on \(\Gamma(|\Lambda|^{1/2})\)).

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = \Delta_{1/2} - \Delta_g\) requires identifying half-densities with functions. Two natural choices:

**Choice 1: Coordinate volume trivialization** (\(\psi \leftrightarrow \psi |dx|^{1/2}\)):
\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})\). COORDINATE-DEPENDENT.
- RNC at \(p\): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) (since \(|g(0)|=1\), \(|g|^{-1/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{12}R_{ij}x^ix^j + O(|x|^3)\), \(\Delta(|g|^{-1/4})|_0 = R/6\)).
- Geodesic polar on \(S^2\): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1/4 - 1/(4\sin^2\theta)\). At equator: \(-1/2 \neq -R/6 = -1/3\).
- Same point, different charts \(\Rightarrow\) different values. \(|g|\) transforms as density\(^2\).

**Choice 2: Riemannian volume trivialization** (\(\psi \leftrightarrow \psi |\mathrm{vol}_g|^{1/2}\)):
\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = 0\) (tautologically).

**Physical content:** Composition forces the COORDINATE volume trivialization (because the time-sliced path integral measure is \(\prod_k dq_k\), not \(\prod_k \sqrt{g(q_k)}\,dq_k\)). The V_HD formula then gives the ordering correction relative to "naive" (coordinate-volume) quantization.

**Eigenvalue comparison IS intrinsic:** \(\mathrm{Spec}(\Delta_{1/2}) \neq \mathrm{Spec}(\Delta_g)\) is a coordinate-independent statement. All BB2/BB4/BB6 witnesses are phrased in terms of spectra — hence intrinsic.

**Prop M0.1 refined:** On compact Lie group with bi-invariant metric, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant IN ANY LEFT-INVARIANT COORDINATE CHART (not necessarily in general coordinates). Physically: the ordering correction respects the group symmetry.

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (mathematician). Needs second agent for promotion.**

## §10. Physicist Second-Agent Review
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-22 -->

**P10.1 Prop M0.1 (constancy): VERIFIED.**
Proof via bi-invariance of |g| is clean. The WARNING in §2 (left-invariant frame trivially gives V_HD=0) is essential: the path integral uses coordinate volume, not left-invariant frames.

**P10.2 SU(2) (§4): CORRECT.**
-1 = -4|rho|^2 with |rho|^2 = dim(G)/12 = 1/4 (Freudenthal-de Vries). Normalization chain tracked correctly.

**P10.3 §5 normalization issue: CORRECTLY CAUGHT.**
V_HD = -R/8 fails for S^3 (gives -3/4 not -1). The correct formula -(d-1)R/(4d) gives -1. Good self-correction.

**P10.4 §6 SU(3): IMPORTANT OPEN.**
First non-constant-curvature test. Harish-Chandra volume density is the right tool. If V_HD(SU(3)) = C_2(ad) * (normalization factor), this extends the Weyl vector story. Physically: SU(3) = flavor group; composition on internal symmetry spaces. Awaiting task #32 result.

**P10.5 §9 (intrinsic vs coordinate): STRONGLY ENDORSED. Most important section.**
Two key points:
(a) Composition forces coordinate-volume trivialization (path integral uses prod dq_k, not prod sqrt(g) dq_k). The half-density |g|^{1/4} converts between the two. This is the PHYSICAL ORIGIN of V_HD.
(b) Eigenvalue comparison is intrinsic even though V_HD is coordinate-dependent. The spectral shift = difference between two intrinsic operators (Delta_{1/2} and Delta_g). Coordinate dependence cancels in the spectral difference.

**P10.6 Rank-1 symmetric spaces (§7): sev-4 note.**
CP^1 = S^2 with constant V_HD in Fubini-Study coords but non-constant in spherical coords: elegant chart-dependence demonstration.

**P10.7 Connection to my OQ1a Philosophenweg:**
"Composition forces curvature coupling" should be read as: composition forces a coordinate-dependent potential whose RNC leading order is (1/6)R. The curvature coupling is physical but chart-expressed.

**Verdict: APPROVE. §9 clarification is the highest-value content. SU(3) computation outstanding.**

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT (mathematician + physicist). APPROVED.**

## §11. Critic Third-Agent Review
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-22 -->

**C11.1 Prop M0.1 (constancy on Lie groups): VERIFIED.**
Proof via bi-invariance is clean. The WARNING in §2 (left-invariant frame gives trivially \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}=0\)) is correctly identified: this is the Riemannian-volume trivialization, not the coordinate-volume one that composition forces.

**C11.2 SU(2) verification (§4): CORRECT.**
\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1 = -4|\rho|^2_{\mathrm{FdV}}\). Normalization chain: Killing \(\to\) round \(S^3\) traced correctly.

**C11.3 §5 value formula + normalization self-correction: CORRECT.**
The \(-R/8\) formula DOES fail for \(S^3\) (\(-3/4 \neq -1\)). The correct formula \(-(d{-}1)R/(4d)\) gives \(-1\). Self-correction shows mathematical care.

**C11.4 §6 SU(3): AGREE — awaiting Task #32.**
Non-constant curvature means the unified formula does not apply. Prop M0.1 guarantees constancy. Harish-Chandra density is the right tool for explicit value.

**C11.5 §7 Rank-1 symmetric spaces: VERIFIED.**
\(\mathbb{CP}^1\) chart-dependence example is the cleanest illustration of the coordinate issue: same manifold (\(S^2\)), different charts, different \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) values at the same point.

**C11.6 §9 (intrinsic vs coordinate): VERIFIED — CONCUR this is the highest-value content.**
Independent RNC calculation: \(|g|^{-1/4} = 1 + (1/12)R_{ij}x^ix^j + O(|x|^3)\), \(\Delta(|g|^{-1/4})|_0 = R/6\), so \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R/6\) in RNC at \(p\).
Cross-check on \(S^2\) equator: spherical coords give \(-1/2\), RNC gives \(-1/3\). DISTINCT. CORRECT.
The physical argument ("composition forces coordinate-volume trivialization") is clean and connects to the path-integral measure.

**C11.7 Two sev-4 notes:**
(a) The Prop M0.1 refined statement (line 142) says "in any left-invariant coordinate chart." This should clarify: left-invariant chart = chart obtained by composing exponential map with left translation. In such charts, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant by the bi-invariance argument.
(b) The paper relevance statement (§8) should distinguish this from D9.1l (which only covers constant-curvature spaces). Prop M0.1 extends to non-constant-curvature Lie groups — genuinely new.

**Verdict: APPROVE. §9 clarification is essential for paper if promoted.**

**STATUS: THREE-AGENT (mathematician + physicist + critic). UNANIMOUS APPROVE.**

## §12. Computationalist: SU(3) V_HD Numerical Verification
<!-- Computationalist: 2026-02-22 -->

**Method:** Finite-difference computation of \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})\) on SU(3) in exponential coordinates. Metric \(g(X,Y) = -2\,\mathrm{Tr}(XY)\) (ON frame: Gell-Mann \(T_a = i\lambda_a/2\)). Exponential-map Jacobian \(\sqrt{|g(X)|} = |\det(dL_{e^{-X}} \circ d\exp_X)|\). Five-point stencils, \(\varepsilon = 10^{-4}\).

**Result:** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\mathrm{SU}(3)) = -1.00000000 \pm 10^{-7}\) at 12 Cartan points. Constant to 8 digits.

**SU(2) cross-check (same metric):** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\mathrm{SU}(2)) = -0.25000000 \pm 10^{-7}\) at 7 Cartan points.

**Root system analysis (ON metric \(g = -2\mathrm{Tr}\)):**
- All SU(3) roots: \(|\alpha|^2_g = 1\). Positive roots: \((i,0)\), \((i/2, i\sqrt{3}/2)\), \((i/2, -i\sqrt{3}/2)\).
- Weyl vector: \(\rho = (i, 0)\), \(|\rho|^2_g = 1\).
- SU(2): \(|\rho|^2_g = 1/4\).

**Formula VERIFIED:**
\[V_{\mathrm{HD}}(G) = -|\rho|^2_g\]
- SU(2): \(-1/4 = -|\rho|^2\). CHECK.
- SU(3): \(-1 = -|\rho|^2\). CHECK.

**Equivalently** (Freudenthal-de Vries, \(|\alpha_{\mathrm{long}}|^2_{\mathrm{CK}} = 2\)):
\[V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\mathrm{SU}(N), g{=}{-}2\mathrm{Tr}) = -\frac{\dim(G) \cdot h^\vee}{24} = -\frac{N(N^2-1)}{24}\]

| \(G\) | dim | \(h^\vee\) | \(|\rho|^2_g\) | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) | \(-(d{-}1)R/(4d)\) | Match? |
|-------|-----|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| SU(2) | 3 | 2 | 1/4 | \(-1/4\) | \(-1/4\) | YES (const curv) |
| SU(3) | 8 | 3 | 1 | \(-1\) | \(-21/16\) | NO |
| SU(4) | 15 | 4 | 5/2 | \(-5/2\) (**verified**) | \(-7/2\) | NO |
| SU(5) | 24 | 5 | 5 | \(-5\) (pred) | \(-115/16\) | NO |

**SU(4) verified:** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -2.50000002 \pm 2\times10^{-7}\) at 12 Cartan points. 6 positive roots, all \(|\alpha|^2=1\). \(|\rho|^2 = 2.500000\). **MATCH.**

**Key result:** \(-(d{-}1)R/(4d)\) matches \(-|\rho|^2\) ONLY for SU(2) = \(S^3\) (constant curvature). For \(G\) with non-constant sectional curvature, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|\rho|^2\) is the correct formula; \(-(d{-}1)R/(4d)\) overestimates.

**Resolves BB0 §5-§6:** Conjecture M0.2 CONFIRMED with normalization factor = 1 (in the metric-dual norm on \(\mathfrak{h}^*\)). The SU(2) "factor of 4" in BB2 \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -4|\rho|^2_{\mathrm{Killing}}\) is just \(-|\rho|^2_{g_{\mathrm{round}}}\) in the round-sphere metric.

**Scripts:** `tmp/su3_vhd_v3.py`, `tmp/su3_vhd_v5.py`, `tmp/su4_vhd_verify.py`.

**STATUS: FOUR-AGENT. V_HD = -|rho|^2 VERIFIED for SU(2), SU(3), AND SU(4).**

## §13. Analytic Proof: V_HD = -R/6 = -|rho|^2 on Compact Lie Groups
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-22 -->

**Theorem M0.3.** On a compact semisimple Lie group \(G\) with bi-invariant metric \(g\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\), where \(R\) is the scalar curvature.

**Proof:** By Prop M0.1, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant on \(G\). Evaluate at the identity \(e\) in exponential coordinates (= RNC at \(e\)):

1. \(|g(0)| = 1\), so \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(e) = -\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})|_{x=0}\).
2. RNC expansion: \(|g(x)|^{-1/4} = 1 + \frac{1}{12}R_{ij}x^i x^j + O(|x|^3)\).
3. \(\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})|_0 = g^{ij}(0)\,\partial_i\partial_j(|g|^{-1/4})|_0 = \frac{1}{6}\delta^{ij}R_{ij} = R/6\).

Hence \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) everywhere on \(G\).

**Corollary:** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|\rho|^2_g\) (metric-dual norm), since for bi-invariant \(g = -c\,B\):
\[R = \frac{d}{4c}, \qquad |\rho|^2_g = \frac{d}{24c} \quad\text{(Freudenthal-de Vries)} \qquad\Rightarrow\qquad R/6 = |\rho|^2_g.\]

**Verification (metric \(g = -2\,\mathrm{Tr}\), so \(c = 1/N\) for SU\((N)\)):**

| \(G\) | \(d\) | \(R = dN/4\) | \(R/6\) | Numeric \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) | Match |
|-------|-------|------------|---------|---------------------------|-------|
| SU(2) | 3 | 3/2 | 1/4 | 0.2500 | YES |
| SU(3) | 8 | 6 | 1 | 1.0000 | YES |
| SU(4) | 15 | 15 | 5/2 | 2.5000 | YES |

**Key insight:** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) at the center of RNC is a GENERAL fact (any Riemannian manifold). On Lie groups, constancy (M0.1) extends this to the entire group. On \(S^d\) with \(d \neq 3\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is NOT constant, so \(-R/6\) is only the local RNC value.

**STATUS: FIVE-AGENT (mathematician analytic proof added to FOUR-AGENT numerical verification).**
