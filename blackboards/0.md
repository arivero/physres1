# Blackboard 0 — Born approximation bridge (Section 2, fermionic)

## Target
Remark 2.3 in fermionic paper, after Remark 2.2 (Crossing symmetry),
before Section 3.

## Core content

The "bosonic source" derivation of Section 2 yields a Yukawa potential
V(r) = -(g²/4πr) e^{-mr}. In the Born approximation of nonrelativistic
scattering theory, the first-order scattering amplitude is:

  f_Born(q) = -(m_red/2πℏ²) Ṽ(q)

where Ṽ(q) = ∫V(r)e^{-iq·r}d³r is the Fourier transform of the
potential. For the Yukawa potential:

  Ṽ(q) = g²/(q² + m²)

This is literally the Fourier-space propagator of the mediator field
evaluated at the (spacelike) momentum transfer q. The "field exchange"
of QFT and the "potential scattering" of QM are two descriptions of
the same physics, connected by the Born approximation.

Key points:
1. **Propagator = Fourier-space potential**: The bosonic propagator
   1/(q² + m²) IS the momentum-space potential at tree level. This
   explains why "exchange of a virtual particle" produces a potential:
   the Fourier transform maps propagator → Yukawa.
2. **Low-q expansion → contact expansion**: Expanding at low momentum:
   g²/(q² + m²) = (g²/m²)[1 - q²/m² + q⁴/m⁴ - ...]
   gives C₀ = g²/m², C₂ = -g²/m⁴, etc. This is the contact expansion
   of Section 4, now derived directly from the propagator.
3. **Range-mass relation**: The Yukawa range r₀ = 1/m is the Compton
   wavelength. In the Born approximation: the first zero of f(q) is
   at q ~ m, setting the resolution scale at which the contact
   approximation breaks down.
4. **Connection to ERE (Remark 4.2)**: At low energy, the Born
   amplitude gives the scattering length a ≈ m_red g²/(2πℏ²m²) —
   the leading contact coefficient.
5. **Beyond Born**: The Born approximation is first-order perturbation
   theory in g². Higher orders (ladder diagrams) resum into the
   Lippmann-Schwinger T-matrix, which for the contact limit reproduces
   Examples 5.1-5.2.

Connection to the paper:
- Bridges Section 2 (field exchange) to Section 4 (contact expansion)
- Shows the contact expansion is not arbitrary but emerges from the
  mediator propagator's low-momentum structure
- Makes explicit that "mediator mass → range" is just Fourier duality
