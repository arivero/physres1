# Anomalies as Constraints on the Refinement Limit
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S154

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 4 (Outlook), Remark 4.5 after Remark 4.4 (EFT).
The paper discusses how the continuum limit requires control data (counterterms, ordering conventions, symmetry-preserving regulators). Anomalies represent a deeper layer: topological/algebraic constraints that the refinement limit must satisfy, which no finite-resolution approximant can see individually but which constrain the allowed continuum theories.

## Key Claims

### The chiral anomaly (ABJ anomaly)
The classical Lagrangian of a massless Dirac fermion coupled to an electromagnetic field has a continuous chiral symmetry ψ → e^{iαγ₅}ψ. Noether's theorem gives a conserved axial current ∂_μ j₅^μ = 0. But the quantum theory (the refinement limit of the regularized path integral) violates this:

  ∂_μ j₅^μ = (e²/16π²) F_μν F̃^μν ≠ 0

This is the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly (1969). It was discovered by Adler and independently by Bell and Jackiw through the triangle diagram: a fermion loop with one axial and two vector vertices.

### Why anomalies are "uncuttable" constraints

1. **No single regulator preserves everything**: Dimensional regularization preserves gauge invariance but explicitly breaks chiral symmetry (γ₅ in d dimensions is problematic). A Pauli-Villars regulator breaks chiral symmetry through the regulator mass. Lattice regularization (the most explicit "finite approximant") encounters the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem: a lattice fermion with exact chiral symmetry, locality, and correct continuum limit is impossible — "fermion doubling" produces unwanted species.

2. **The anomaly is regulator-independent**: Despite no single regulator preserving chiral symmetry, the anomaly coefficient (e²/16π²) is universal — the same in every regularization scheme. It is an integer (in appropriate normalization), determined by topology: the index of the Dirac operator (Atiyah-Singer index theorem).

3. **Anomaly matching ('t Hooft, 1980)**: Anomaly coefficients computed from UV degrees of freedom must equal those computed from IR degrees of freedom — they are invariant under RG flow. This is a non-perturbative constraint on the refinement limit: whatever theory emerges in the continuum, its anomaly structure must match the UV.

### Physical consequences
- π⁰ → γγ: the neutral pion decay rate is entirely determined by the anomaly coefficient and the pion decay constant. Adler's prediction Γ = α²m_π³/(64π³f_π²) matches experiment to ~1%.
- Anomaly cancellation in the Standard Model: the requirement that gauge anomalies cancel constrains the fermion content: Q_u + Q_d + Q_e + Q_ν = 0 for each generation (charges must sum to zero). This is a topological constraint on which theories can exist, not derivable from any finite approximation.

### Connection to "uncuttable" theme
The anomaly is the definitive example of a quantity that:
- Is invisible at any finite step of the regularization (each regulator either breaks the symmetry explicitly or introduces doublers)
- Emerges universally in the refinement limit with an exact, topological coefficient
- Constrains which refinement limits are consistent (anomaly cancellation)
- Is RG-invariant ('t Hooft matching): the same at every resolution scale

## Proposed Remark
Remark 4.5 in uncuttable Section 4, after Remark 4.4 (EFT).
Content: Chiral anomaly as a topological constraint on the refinement limit. No single regulator preserves all classical symmetries (Nielsen-Ninomiya for lattice, γ₅ problem for dim-reg), yet the anomaly coefficient e²/(16π²) is universal and integer-valued. 't Hooft anomaly matching ensures this coefficient is RG-invariant. Physical consequence: π⁰→γγ rate. Anomaly cancellation constrains which fermion content is consistent.
