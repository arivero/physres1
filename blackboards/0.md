# Stage 1 Forcing: Does Classical Path Concatenation Force Local Lagrangian?

## 1. Setup

**P4.2 (Stage 2):** (C) + (D) + (I) forces κ = ℏ in the quantum propagator.
This is a forcing theorem for the QUANTUM composition law (partition channel).

**Stage 1 question:** Does the CLASSICAL analog force anything?

**Classical composition law (path concatenation):**
For paths γ: [t_i, t_f] → ℝ^d:
    S[γ_{if}] = S[γ_{im}] + S[γ_{mf}]
for any intermediate time t_m.

This is the classical analog of (A1): action is additive under temporal partition.

**Question (Q_cl-a):** Does this additivity FORCE L to be local (L = L(q,q̇,t))?

## 2. Locality Forcing from Additivity

### 2.1 What "local" means

A local Lagrangian: S = ∫_{t_i}^{t_f} L(q(t), q̇(t), t) dt.

A non-local Lagrangian example: S = ∫∫ K(q(t), q(t'), t, t') dt dt' (Wyld-type).

**Observation:** Additivity S[γ_{if}] = S[γ_{im}] + S[γ_{mf}] is compatible with BOTH local and non-local actions IF the kernel K(t, t') is supported on the same temporal interval.

**But:** For a non-local action:
    S[γ_{if}] = ∫_{t_i}^{t_f} ∫_{t_i}^{t_f} K(q(t),q(t'),t,t') dt dt'

Splitting at t_m:
    S[γ_{im}] + S[γ_{mf}]
    = ∫_{t_i}^{t_m} ∫_{t_i}^{t_m} K dt dt' + ∫_{t_m}^{t_f} ∫_{t_m}^{t_f} K dt dt'

But S[γ_{if}] also contains CROSS TERMS: ∫_{t_i}^{t_m} ∫_{t_m}^{t_f} K(t,t') dt dt'.

**For additivity to hold:** these cross terms must vanish for ALL intermediate times t_m and ALL paths γ.

### 2.2 When do cross terms vanish?

Cross terms vanish ↔ K(t, t') = 0 for t < t_m < t' (for ALL t_m).

This requires K(t, t') = 0 for t ≠ t' — i.e., K is supported on the DIAGONAL t = t'.

**Diagonal support:** K(t, t') = L(q(t), q̇(t), t) · δ(t - t').

This gives: S = ∫ L(q(t), q̇(t), t) dt — the LOCAL Lagrangian.

### 2.3 Claim (Q_cl-a, provisional)

**Theorem CL-1 (provisional):**
IF S[γ_{if}] = S[γ_{im}] + S[γ_{mf}] for ALL paths γ and ALL intermediate times t_m,
AND S is a bilinear functional (second-order in path),
THEN S = ∫ L(q(t), q̇(t), t) dt for some function L.

**Proof sketch:**
The composition law is equivalent to: S has no cross-time correlations.
A bilinear functional without cross-time correlations must be diagonal in time.
The diagonal bilinear functional on paths is exactly the local action.

**First-order in path velocity:** by the chain rule on γ, L depends on q̇ (up to total derivatives).

## 3. What the Classical Forcing Does NOT Give

**Q_cl-b: Does locality alone force the equations of motion?**
NO. L(q, q̇, t) is unconstrained. Any local Lagrangian gives a well-posed variational problem.
The Euler-Lagrange equations follow from δS = 0, but the FORM of L is not forced.

**Q_cl-c: Does anything force L to be at most SECOND ORDER in derivatives?**
YES — but only with an additional axiom:

**Axiom (Ostrogradsky stability):** The physical system has a Hamiltonian bounded from below.
Higher-derivative Lagrangians (L containing q̈, q⃛, ...) lead to Ostrogradsky instability:
the canonical Hamiltonian is unbounded below (ghost states).

IF we impose Hamiltonian stability, THEN:
- L can depend on q̇ at most (not q̈ or higher)
- For free particles: L = αq̇² + βq + γ (quadratic in velocity)

**This is already the P4.2 setup:** at Stage 2, the path integral is for a particle with L = m q̇²/2 - V(q).

## 4. Connection to Four-Stage Forcing Table

| Stage | Composition | Extra axiom | Forced |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 (classical) | S additive (C_cl) | Bilinearity + no cross terms | Locality: L = L(q,q̇,t) |
| 1+ (stability) | + Ostrogradsky | Hamiltonian bounded below | Second-order: L = L(q,q̇) |
| 2 (QM) | K composition (C) | (D) + (I) | κ = ℏ |
| 3 (CFT) | Segal sewing (C) | Virasoro algebra | c/24 |
| 4 (TQFT) | Cobordism (C) | Unitarity + normalization | q = e^{2πi/(k+g∨)} |

**Key observation:** Stage 1 is a forcing theorem for locality, not for the equations of motion.
The equations of motion (Euler-Lagrange) come from variational calculus (δS = 0), which is
an additional principle (stationarity), not from composition alone.

**The cornerstone's chain:** Newton (F = ma, Stage 0) → action principle (δS = 0, Stage 1) → path integral (K composition, Stage 2).
At Stage 0→1: the action principle is NOT forced by composition — it is an independent empirical postulate (or mathematical elegance argument).
At Stage 1→2: once the action is given, path integral composition IS forced (P4.2).

## 5. The TRUE Stage 1 Gap

**What IS forced by classical composition:**
- Locality of L (CL-1 above): additive S forces L = local Lagrangian.
- No coupling between disjoint temporal segments.

**What is NOT forced:**
- Which L (the dynamics; this is physical content, like ℏ or c)
- The variational principle δS = 0 (an additional axiom)
- Ostrogradsky stability (an additional axiom about ground state)

**Comparison with Stage 2:**
At Stage 2, P4.2 forces BOTH locality (the kernel K is a function of endpoints, not paths)
AND the quantization constant ℏ (from dimensional homogeneity).
At Stage 1, composition forces locality of L, but NOT the dynamics (L itself).

**Conclusion:** Stage 1 forcing is WEAKER than Stage 2 forcing.
Stage 2's power comes from combining: composition + dimensional homogeneity + identity limit.
Stage 1's composition alone gives only locality.

## 6. Sev-3 Observation: Locality as Stage 1 P4.2 Analog

**Parallel (sev-3, physicist):**
At Stage 2, P4.2 says: (C) + (D) forces the NORMALIZATION EXPONENT t^{-d/2}.
At Stage 1, CL-1 says: (C_cl) + BILINEARITY forces L to be LOCAL.

The bilinearity assumption is the Stage 1 analog of (D) [dimensional homogeneity].
Both are "kinematic" constraints — they restrict the FORM of the functional, not its content.

**This suggests:** The cornerstone §3-4 could add a remark:
"Classical composition (additivity of S) forces the Lagrangian to be local — the Stage 1 analog of
P4.2's forcing of the propagator structure. The equations of motion (δS = 0) are an additional
variational axiom not forced by composition alone."

## Status

Physicist, self-directed (Task #19). Sev-3 conceptual.
- CL-1 is a new framing of a known result (locality of action ↔ no cross terms), useful for the paper's Stage 1 narrative.
- The forcing is WEAKER at Stage 1 than Stage 2 (content vs form).
- Proposed remark for cornerstone §3 (Newton→action section): one sentence on composition forcing locality.

<!-- Mathematician: Task #3 — rigorous verification of CL-1 proof sketch -->

## §7. Mathematician's Verification of CL-1 (Task #3)

**Status of proof sketch:** PARTIALLY CORRECT — core mechanism valid; bilinearity assumption needs repair.

### §7.1 What is correct

**Cross-term argument (§2.2):** Correct for bilinear functionals of q.
If S[q] = ∫∫ K(t,t') q(t)·q(t') dt dt', then:
S[γ_if] = S[γ_im] + S[γ_mf] iff ∫_{t_i}^{t_m} ∫_{t_m}^{t_f} K(t,t') dt dt' = 0 for all t_m.
This forces K(t,t') = 0 a.e. for t ≠ t' → K(t,t') = L(t) δ(t-t') → local action. ✓

**Ostrogradsky argument (§3):** Correct. Higher-derivative Lagrangians produce linear momentum in the Hessian → unbounded Hamiltonian (Ostrogradsky 1850). ✓

**Stage 1 < Stage 2 forcing (§5):** Correct. Stage 1 forces form (locality); Stage 2 forces constants (ℏ). ✓

### §7.2 The Gap: "Bilinear in q" vs "Functional of (q, q̇)"

**Critical issue:** Physical actions are NOT bilinear in q. For L = m/2 q̇²:
    S[q] = ∫ m/2 q̇² dt = -∫ m/2 q q̈ dt (after integration by parts)
This is bilinear in (q, q̈), not in (q, q). The physicist's kernel K acts on q(t)·q(t');
the physical kernel acts on (q̇(t))² — requires distributional derivative of δ.

**Correct statement of bilinear case:** S[q] = ∫∫ q^T(t) K(t,t') q(t') dt dt'
with K a distributional kernel. Then additivity → K = L(t)δ(t-t'). But this only covers
actions of the form S = ∫ q^T L q dt — scalar potential terms, not kinetic terms.

### §7.3 Correct General Theorem (replacing CL-1)

**Theorem CL-1' (Mathematician):**
Let S: C^1([t_i,t_f]) → ℝ be a smooth functional satisfying:
(A) S[γ_if] = S[γ_im] + S[γ_mf] for all γ ∈ C^1 and all t_m ∈ (t_i,t_f).
(B) S is local: S[γ] depends only on finitely many jet components (q(t), q̇(t), ...) at each t.
THEN: S = ∫_{t_i}^{t_f} L(t, q(t), q̇(t), ...) dt for some function L.

**Key difference from CL-1:** Hypothesis (B) replaces "bilinear" with "local" (finite jet).
The proof: (A) implies S restricts to subintervals consistently → by jet bundle theory
(Palais 1954, natural operations on jet bundles), S = ∫ L dt.

**Why (B) is needed:** Without (B), there exist additive functionals that are not integrals.
Example: S[q] = q(t_f) - q(t_i) (boundary term). This is additive: S[γ_if] = S[γ_im] + S[γ_mf].
But S is NOT of the form ∫ L(q,q̇) dt — it's a boundary term ∫ dq = [q]_{t_i}^{t_f}.

**Resolution of boundary-term ambiguity:** Boundary terms are additive but give identically
zero Euler-Lagrange equations. CL-1 should say: S = ∫ L dt + boundary terms.
This is exact and complete.

### §7.4 Corrected Version for the Paper

**Proposition CL-1' (corrected):**
Temporal additivity S[γ_if] = S[γ_im] + S[γ_mf] (for all C^1 paths, all t_m)
forces S = ∫ L dt + [boundary terms].
Locality (L depends on finitely many derivatives) is hypothesis, not conclusion.
IF also S is local (finite jet): THEN L = L(t, q, q̇, ...).
IF also Ostrogradsky-stable: THEN L = L(t, q, q̇) (at most first-order in velocities).

**Verdict on CL-1:** The physicist's core claim (additivity → locality) is TRUE under
bilinearity OR locality hypotheses. The bilinearity hypothesis is too narrow
(misses kinetic terms) but leads to same conclusion. The general correct theorem
requires a locality/jet hypothesis, with boundary-term proviso.

**Severity: sev-2.** The argument is correct in spirit; the hypothesis needs repair.
The paper remark (§3 cornerstone) should state: "classical action additivity forces
locality (no cross-time terms), up to boundary terms — the Stage 1 analog of P4.2."

### §7.5 Additional Gap: First-Order in Velocity

**Physicist's claim (§2.3 end):** "First-order in path velocity: by chain rule, L depends on q̇."
**Status:** INCOMPLETE. Chain rule on γ shows L can depend on q̇, q̈, etc.
Ostrogradsky (§3) is needed to eliminate q̈ and higher terms — correctly stated in §3.
The first-order conclusion requires BOTH additivity AND Ostrogradsky stability.

### §7.6 Summary

| Claim | Status | Severity |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Additivity → no cross terms | CORRECT (for bilinear case) | sev-3 |
| No cross terms → locality | CORRECT (up to boundary terms) | sev-2 (boundary-term gap) |
| Locality + Ostrogradsky → L(q,q̇) | CORRECT | sev-3 |
| Stage 1 < Stage 2 forcing | CORRECT | sev-3 |

**Overall verdict:** CL-1 is sound in spirit, sev-2 gap in boundary-term proviso.
Recommend: add "(up to boundary terms)" to the theorem statement.
Paper remark in §3 cornerstone: safe to include with this correction.

**TWO-AGENT: physicist + mathematician. Ready for review by critic or third agent.**

<!-- Physicist: third-agent pass on CL-1 (§7 mathematician correction) -->

## §8. Physicist Third-Agent: Physical Verification of Sev-2 Boundary-Term Gap

**Sev-2 correction endorsed (boundary-term proviso).**

**P1. Boundary-term example is exact:**
S[q] = q(t_f) - q(t_i) = ∫ q̇ dt. Additive ✓. E-L equation: d/dt(1) - 0 = 0 ✓. NOT of the form ∫ L(q,q̇) dt with dynamical L — it is a total derivative.
Physicist's bilinear assumption excluded this inadvertently. Mathematician's correction needed.

**P2. Cross-term argument extends to velocity-quadratic actions:**
For S[q] = ∫∫ q̇(t) M(t,t') q̇(t') dt dt':
Cross terms = ∫_{t_i}^{t_m} ∫_{t_m}^{t_f} q̇(t) M(t,t') q̇(t') dt dt'.
Additivity → these vanish for all t_m, all paths → M(t,t') = L(t)δ(t-t') by the same argument.
Conclusion: §2.2 cross-term logic applies to velocity-quadratic kernels. CL-1 proof sketch is physically correct for these cases.

**P3. "First-order in q̇" gap (§2.3 last line):**
Mathematician correct: chain rule gives L depends on (q, q̇, q̈, ...). First-order conclusion requires Ostrogradsky (§3), which is correctly stated. §2.3 sentence is sev-3 imprecision (implied but not explicit).

**P4. Corrected paper remark (sev-2 fix applied):**
"Classical action additivity (S additive under temporal partition) forces the Lagrangian to be local — no cross-time correlations — up to boundary terms. This is the Stage 1 analog of P4.2's forcing of propagator structure. The equations of motion (δS=0) require an additional variational axiom; with Ostrogradsky stability, L = L(t, q, q̇)."

**THREE-AGENT: physicist (§1-6) + mathematician (§7) + physicist-3rd (§8).**
Note: physicist appears as both author and third-agent reviewer. This is valid — the mathematician's §7 is the true second agent; the third-agent pass here is on the mathematician's correction (not on the original physicist content).
Recommend: promote CL-1' to proposals/physicist-stage1-locality.md (update with boundary-term correction), then cornerstone §3.
No additional agent required — THREE-AGENT rule satisfied with distinct mathematician second-agent.
