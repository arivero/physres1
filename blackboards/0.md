# Lattice Gauge Theory: Refinement Limit and Asymptotic Freedom
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S147

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 4 (Outlook: refinement compatibility as "the extra structure"), after Remark 4.2 (dimensional regularization). Wilson's lattice formulation is the most concrete realization of the "uncuttable" pattern in gauge field theory: the lattice is a finite-resolution approximant, and the continuum QFT is defined as the refinement limit (lattice spacing a → 0) controlled by asymptotic freedom.

## Key Claims

### Wilson's lattice formulation (1974)
Wilson's lattice gauge theory discretizes spacetime on a hypercubic lattice with spacing a. The gauge field lives on links as group elements U_μ(x) ∈ SU(N), and the action is built from the smallest closed loops (plaquettes):

  S_W = β Σ_P Re Tr(1 - U_P)

where U_P = U_μ(x) U_ν(x+aμ̂) U_μ(x+aν̂)† U_ν(x)† is the product of link variables around a plaquette, and β = 2N/g² is the lattice coupling.

### The refinement limit
1. **Finite lattice = finite approximant**: For any nonzero a, the lattice theory is well-defined (no UV divergences — the lattice spacing provides a natural cutoff).
2. **Continuum = refinement limit**: The continuum gauge theory is the a → 0 limit, but this limit requires tuning the bare coupling g(a) as a function of the lattice spacing.
3. **Asymptotic freedom controls the limit**: For non-abelian gauge theories (SU(N) with sufficiently few fermion flavors), the beta function is negative: β(g) = -β_0 g³/(16π²) + ..., with β_0 = (11N - 2N_f)/3 > 0. This means g(a) → 0 as a → 0 — the coupling vanishes in the UV, and the theory approaches the Gaussian fixed point. The lattice coupling must be tuned to the critical surface β → ∞ (g → 0) to reach the continuum limit.

### Connection to the paper's themes
1. **"Uncuttable" pattern at full strength**: No finite lattice IS QCD. The theory is defined by the lattice spacing → 0 limit, with the bare coupling running according to the perturbative beta function. This parallels Section 2's integral: no finite partition IS the integral.

2. **Counterterms from relevance**: In the lattice theory, relevant and marginal operators generate power-law and log divergences as a → 0. The gauge coupling is the only marginal coupling (for pure gauge theory), and its running is the only tuning needed — this is renormalizability, expressed as "finitely many counterterms suffice."

3. **Structural preservation**: The lattice maintains exact gauge invariance at every lattice spacing (because the action is built from traces of Wilson loops, which are gauge-invariant). This parallels the symplectic integrators of Remark 3.4: the finite approximant preserves a structural invariant that the continuum theory inherits.

4. **Confinement as a non-perturbative refinement phenomenon**: The area law for large Wilson loops (signaling quark confinement) is a strong-coupling lattice result that must persist into the weak-coupling (continuum) regime. Whether it does is a statement about the refinement limit that perturbation theory alone cannot verify — this is the content of the Clay Millennium Prize problem for Yang-Mills.

### Contrast with abelian (U(1)) case
For compact U(1) lattice gauge theory, the beta function has a different structure: there is no asymptotic freedom, and the lattice theory has a first-order phase transition (rather than a smooth continuum limit). The free photon emerges only in the weak-coupling (Coulomb) phase — the lattice refinement limit exists but is trivial (free field). This contrast highlights that asymptotic freedom is the specific dynamical mechanism that makes the non-abelian refinement limit both non-trivial and controllable.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 4.3, after Remark 4.2 (dimensional regularization), before the closing paragraph of Section 4.

Content: Wilson's lattice gauge theory as the definitive physical realization of the "uncuttable" pattern. Plaquette action, link variables, exact lattice gauge invariance at every spacing. Asymptotic freedom drives the coupling to the Gaussian fixed point as a → 0, making the continuum limit controllable. Confinement as a non-perturbative property of the refinement limit.
