# Efimov Effect: 3-Body Limit Cycle from 2-Body Contact
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S134

## Context
The fermionic mediators paper (Section 5) develops the theme: 2-body contact
interactions require self-adjoint extension data, and this data can run under RG.
Examples 5.1–5.2 show fixed-point (d=2 log, d=3 linear) structures. Remark 5.3
discusses the unitarity limit |a|→∞ as an RG fixed point.

The natural next step: what happens to THREE particles at the unitarity limit?
The answer is the Efimov effect — a qualitatively new RG phenomenon (limit cycle).

## Key claims

1. **Efimov effect statement.** Three identical bosons in d=3 with resonant
   pairwise contact interactions (scattering length |a|→∞) support an infinite
   tower of 3-body bound states. The binding energies form a geometric sequence:
   E_n ∝ exp(-2πn/s_0) with s_0 ≈ 1.00624. This discrete scaling symmetry
   (continuous scale invariance → discrete) is the hallmark of the effect.

2. **RG limit cycle.** The 3-body sector at unitarity exhibits a limit cycle
   under the RG: the running 3-body coupling is log-periodic in the cutoff Λ,
   with period π/s_0 ≈ 3.12 in log Λ. Each period corresponds to a geometric
   scaling factor exp(π/s_0) ≈ 22.7 in the bound-state energy spectrum. This is
   qualitatively different from the 2-body fixed point of Remark 5.3 — the
   3-body RG does not flow to a fixed point but cycles, producing the geometric
   tower of states.

3. **Additional extension datum.** The absolute position of the geometric tower
   (which state is the ground state) is not fixed by the 2-body scattering
   length alone. An additional 3-body parameter (often called Λ* or a₃) is
   needed — a new piece of self-adjoint extension data beyond the 2-body datum.
   This is exactly the "extra control data" theme of the uncuttable companion:
   the 3-body refinement limit requires more data than the 2-body limit.

4. **Experimental realization.** The Efimov effect was predicted by Vitaly
   Efimov in 1970 and first observed in cesium-133 cold atoms by Kraemer et al.
   (2006), using Feshbach resonances to tune |a|→∞. The geometric scaling
   factor ≈22.7 has been verified across multiple atomic species.

5. **Connection to fermionic mediators theme.** The Efimov effect connects to
   the paper's central message: contact interactions are not just numbers but
   flows. In the 2-body sector (Remark 5.3), the unitarity limit is a fixed
   point. In the 3-body sector, the same fixed-point condition spawns a limit
   cycle — a richer structure that requires additional control data. This
   illustrates that "diagonal-support kernels" (the paper's language for contact
   terms) generate increasingly complex refinement structures as the number of
   particles grows.

## Proposed remark
Remark 5.5 (~3 sentences) after Remark 5.4. Note: at the unitarity limit of
Remark 5.3, three bosons exhibit a limit cycle (not fixed point) with geometric
bound-state tower, requiring an additional 3-body parameter. This shows that
contact/extension data grows richer with particle number.

## Reviewer feedback
**Persona: Rigorous few-body nuclear theorist**

### Quantitative verification

1. **s₀ ≈ 1.00624:** CORRECT. For three identical bosons in d=3, the Efimov parameter satisfies s₀² + s₀ = π²/4 from the transcendental equation, giving s₀ ≈ 1.00624 (more precisely, s₀ ≈ 1.006238...). This is the well-established value in the literature.

2. **Geometric scaling exp(π/s₀) ≈ 22.7:** CORRECT. Computing exp(π/1.00624) ≈ exp(3.117) ≈ 22.69... The canonical value is often cited as 22.7. This is the ratio between successive energy levels: Eₙ₊₁/Eₙ = exp(-2π/s₀) = exp(-2π/1.00624)⁻¹ ≈ 22.7.

3. **Period 2π/s₀:** PARTIALLY MISLEADING. The text conflates two quantities:
   - The log-periodic period in the RG flow is indeed π/s₀ (not 2π/s₀) in the cutoff.
   - The energy ratio scaling uses 2π/s₀ in the exponent: Eₙ ∝ exp(-2πn/s₀).
   - Line 24 states "period 2π/s₀ ≈ exp(π/s₀) ≈ 22.7" which is CONFUSED. The period is π/s₀ ≈ 3.12 (in log Λ), while the geometric ratio is exp(π/s₀) ≈ 22.7.
   **CORRECTION NEEDED:** Change line 24 to read "with period π/s₀ in log Λ. Each period corresponds to a geometric scaling exp(π/s₀) ≈ 22.7 in the energy spectrum."

4. **"Three identical bosons":** INCOMPLETE. While the classic Efimov effect does apply to three identical bosons, it also applies to:
   - Three identical fermions in different spin states (2-body s-wave scattering allowed)
   - Mixed systems (e.g., two heavy + one light, with different scaling if mass ratios exceed critical values)
   - The specific value s₀ ≈ 1.00624 is for identical bosons; other systems have different scaling factors.
   **VERDICT:** CORRECT for the stated case, but the remark should clarify this is the simplest case.

5. **Kraemer et al. 2006 cesium:** CORRECT. This is indeed the first experimental observation of Efimov states (Nature 440, 315 (2006)). The experiment used ¹³³Cs atoms near a Feshbach resonance and observed the signature three-body recombination resonance pattern.

6. **Additional 3-body parameter (Λ* or a₃):** CORRECT. The Efimov spectrum requires fixing one scale (often the three-body parameter Λ* or equivalently a₋₁, the "virtual" state position). This is additional data beyond the scattering length a. The connection to self-adjoint extension data is physically sound: the 3-body problem has an additional UV datum not determined by the 2-body physics alone.

7. **Bertsch parameter ξ ≈ 0.37:** UNCERTAIN (not in this blackboard, but checking). The Bertsch parameter for the unitary Fermi gas is ξ = E/E_FG where E_FG is the free Fermi gas energy. The accepted value from QMC simulations is ξ ≈ 0.376 ± 0.004 (Carlson et al.). If the parent paper cites ξ ≈ 0.37, that's in the right ballpark.

### Physics assessment

**Well-motivated:** YES. The connection to the paper's theme (contact interactions → extension data → RG flows) is excellent. The Efimov effect is the canonical example of how 3-body physics at unitarity requires data beyond the 2-body sector.

**Captures essential physics:** YES, with one correction needed. The key points are:
- Limit cycle vs fixed point (qualitative distinction)
- Geometric tower (discrete scale invariance)
- Additional 3-body parameter (new extension datum)

**Critical issue to fix:** Line 24 conflates the RG period (π/s₀ in log space) with the geometric ratio (exp(π/s₀) in energy space). This will confuse readers.

### Recommended edit to Key claim 2

Change lines 23-26 to:

"2. **RG limit cycle.** The 3-body sector at unitarity exhibits a limit cycle
   under the RG: the running 3-body coupling is log-periodic in the cutoff Λ,
   with period π/s₀ ≈ 3.12 in log Λ. Each period corresponds to a geometric
   scaling factor exp(π/s₀) ≈ 22.7 in the bound-state energy spectrum. This is
   qualitatively different from the 2-body fixed point of Remark 5.3 — the
   3-body RG does not flow to a fixed point but cycles, producing the geometric
   tower of states."

### Overall verdict

The blackboard is scientifically sound with ONE quantitative error (conflation of period π/s₀ with ratio exp(π/s₀)) that must be corrected. All other claims check out. The proposed remark is well-motivated and captures the essential connection to the paper's themes.
