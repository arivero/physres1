# P4.2 ↔ RCP Axiom Mapping
Date: 2026-02-14
Cycle: D49

## 1. Mapping Table

| P4.2 hypothesis | RCP axiom | Relation | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| **(C)** composition semigroup | **A1** composition law | (C) ⊂ A1 | A1 is channel-general; (C) is partition-specific (kernel semigroup) |
| **(I)** identity limit \(K \to \delta\) as \(t \to 0\) | **A2** identity limit | (I) = A2\|\_partition | A2 also covers scale (\(\mu \to \mu\)) and representation |
| **(D)** dimensional homogeneity \([K]=L^{-d}\) | **A5** dimensional homogeneity | (D) = A5\|\_partition | A5 also constrains scale/representation parameters |
| — | **A3** representation equivalence | Not used by P4.2 | Independent channel (ordering/domain) |
| — | **A4** scale invariance | Not used by P4.2 | Independent channel (RG flow) |

## 2. Derived hypotheses (not independent axioms)

| Originally in P4.2 | Status | Derivation |
|---|---|---|
| **(L\_exp)** exponential weight | **Theorem of A1** | Fourier multiplicativity → quadratic log → Gaussian (D29/S288) |
| **(L\_loc)** local action dependence | **Theorem of A1+A5** | Lévy obstruction: \(\alpha = 2\) forced by dimensional solvability (D39/S295) |
| **iε prescription** | **Theorem of A1** | Degree-counting: only linear \(f(x)=x\) preserves composition (D37/S292) |
| **Continuum time** | **Theorem of A5** | \(\{m,\hbar\}\) cannot build \([\varepsilon]=T\) (P4.2g) |

## 3. Decomposition of P4.2 conclusions by axiom

| Conclusion | Axiom(s) required |
|---|---|
| \(d/2\) normalization exponent | A1 alone |
| \(\exists\kappa\) with \([\kappa]=[\text{action}]\) | A1 + A5 |
| \(\kappa = \hbar\) identification | A5 (unique constant with \([\text{action}]\) from \(\{m,\hbar\}\)) |
| \(\kappa \to 0\) failure (no distributional identity) | A2 |
| \(\kappa \to \infty\) failure (trivial weights) | A1 (composition loses content) |
| Exponential weight uniqueness | A1 (functional equation) |
| Lévy process exclusion (\(\alpha \neq 2\)) | A5 (dimensional obstruction) |
| iε uniqueness | A1 (degree-counting) |
| Continuum time necessity | A5 + A2 (dimensional obstruction + meaningful limit target) |

## 4. What A3 adds (representation channel, orthogonal to P4.2)

- **Ordering equivalence**: different quantizations \(Q_L, Q_W, Q_{BD}\) of same classical symbol compatible modulo \(O(\hbar)\)
- **Domain data transport**: self-adjoint extension parameters \(\theta_{\text{dom}}\) must be carried in parameter bundle
- **Four-layer stratification** (D35/S290):
  1. Principal symbol — all orderings agree
  2. Connection term — half-density fixes uniquely
  3. Scalar potential — deformation freedom \(O(\hbar^2)\) persists
  4. Domain — independent (boundary conditions)
- **Measurability** (D38/S294): Layer-3 shift unmeasurably small (\(|\Delta E_0| \sim 0.006\text{-}0.06\) meV)

## 5. What A4 adds (scale channel, orthogonal to P4.2)

- **RG flow**: \(\mu\,dg_R/d\mu = \beta(g_R)\) as scale-compatibility map \(\tau_\Lambda(\theta)\)
- **Dimensional transmutation**: bare coupling \(g_B(\Lambda)\) traded for physical scale \(\kappa_*\)
- **Closure failure = divergence**: UV divergences signal closure failure without parameter update
- **Beta function is forced** (not derived) by scale compatibility requirement
- Example: 2D delta interaction, \(\beta(g_R) = (m/\pi\hbar^2)\,g_R^2\)

## 6. Structural verdicts

**V1 (Injection with surjectivity at partition level):** The mapping \((C) \hookrightarrow A1,\; (I) \hookrightarrow A2,\; (D) \hookrightarrow A5\) is an injection of P4.2 hypotheses into partition-restricted RCP axioms, surjective at the partition level. P4.2 exhausts the partition-channel content of A1+A2+A5.

**V2 (Proper containment globally):** Each RCP axiom is strictly broader than its P4.2 counterpart:
- A1 covers composition in all three channels (partition, representation, scale)
- A2 covers identity/triviality limits in all channels
- A5 constrains dimensions of all parameters, not just kernel normalization

**V3 (Logical independence of channels):** A3 and A4 are logically independent of P4.2. Removing them does not affect P4.2's conclusions; adding them does not strengthen P4.2 within the partition channel. Note: axioms can be operationally coupled in specific systems (e.g., singular potentials require both A3 and A4), but they do not logically imply each other.

**V4 (Crown witness interpretation):** P4.2 is the crown witness for partition compatibility. The full RCP framework is NOT reducible to P4.2: it requires A3 (representation witness: ordering equivalence + domain data) and A4 (scale witness: RG flow + dimensional transmutation) as independent structural inputs.

**V5 (No structural gaps):** The mapping reveals no gaps or redundancies. Every P4.2 hypothesis maps cleanly to an RCP axiom, and the derived hypotheses (\(L_{\text{exp}}\), \(L_{\text{loc}}\), iε, continuum time) are theorems of the axioms, confirming internal consistency.

## 7. D50: Is (D) derivable from (C)?

**Claim:** Hypothesis (D) decomposes into three parts, all derivable from (C) + the physical setup.

### 7.1 Decomposition of (D)

| Component | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| (D₁) \([K] = L^{-d}\) | Kernel has density dimension | **Theorem of (C)** on \(\mathbb{R}^d\) |
| (D₂) Well-defined dimensions | All quantities \(M,L,T\)-typed | **Trivially true** for any Lagrangian theory |
| (D₃) Limited dimensional basis | \(\{m\}\) alone cannot build \([\text{action}]\) | **Property of the setup** (\([m]=M\), 1-dimensional basis) |

### 7.2 Proof of (D₁)

Composition on \(M = \mathbb{R}^d\):
\[
K(x,y;T) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} K(x,z;t_1)\,K(z,y;t_2)\,d^d z.
\]
Dimensional consistency: \([K] = [K]^2 \cdot [L]^d\), hence \([K] = [L]^{-d}\). \(\square\)

**Curved extension:** On \((M,g)\), \(d\mu_g = \sqrt{|g|}\,d^d z\) has \([d\mu_g] = [L]^d\). Same result: \([K] = [L]^{-d}\).

### 7.3 Consequences

With (D₁) derived from (C) and (D₂)+(D₃) being setup properties:

| Previous attribution | Revised attribution |
|---|---|
| \(\exists\kappa\): A1 + A5 | \(\exists\kappa\): A1 + setup |
| \(\kappa = \hbar\): A5 | \(\kappa = \hbar\): setup (unique new constant) |
| Lévy exclusion: A5 | Lévy exclusion: A1 (Gaussian forced for action-based kernels by D29) |
| Continuum time: A5 | Continuum time: A1 + setup (\(\{m,\kappa\}\) cannot build \([T]\)) |

### 7.4 Revised hypothesis count

**P4.2 = theorem of (C) + (I) + physical setup**

| Hypothesis | Type | Content |
|---|---|---|
| **(C)** Composition | Mathematical axiom | Semigroup law on \(\mathbb{R}^d\) |
| **(I)** Identity limit | Mathematical axiom | \(K \to \delta\) as \(t \to 0\) |
| **Setup** | Physical input | Action-based dynamics of mass-\(m\) particle on \(\mathbb{R}^d\) |

Effective count: **2 mathematical axioms + 1 physical setup**, not 3 independent hypotheses.

### 7.5 What "action-based" contributes

The setup assumption "action-based dynamics" does the following work:
- Provides \([S] = ML^2T^{-1}\) → forces \([\kappa] = [\text{action}]\)
- Ensures kernel depends on classical action → triggers D29 exponential theorem
- Excludes Lévy processes (not action-based, even though they satisfy (C)+(I))
- Excludes discrete dynamical systems (lattice maps) via continuum \(\mathbb{R}^d\)

**Key insight:** (D) is not a separate axiom — it is the dimensional shadow of the physical setup.

## 8. D51: Are commuting diagrams theorems or axioms?

### 8.1 Channel pairs

| Channel pair | Commutativity | Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Partition × Representation | In continuum limit | Short-time universality: all orderings agree at \(O(1)\); differences are \(O(\hbar\Delta t)\) per slice, \(O(\hbar)\) total | Theorem of A1+A3 |
| Partition × Scale | Trivially | Independent parameters: \(\Delta t\) (temporal) vs \(\mu\) (energy) | Trivially true |
| Representation × Scale | For observables | Different orderings → different \(\beta\)-functions at \(O(\hbar^2)\), but same physical observables (deformation equivalence, D35/D38) | Theorem of A3+A4 |

### 8.2 Key subtlety: parameter-level vs observable-level

Commutativity holds at the level of **physical observables**, not individual parameters:
- Partition × Representation: at finite \(N\), different orderings give different per-slice contributions. But \(N \to \infty\) limit is ordering-independent at leading order (universality).
- Representation × Scale: Weyl and half-density orderings give \(\beta\)-functions differing at \(O(\hbar^2)\). But observable predictions agree (deformation equivalence).

### 8.3 Verdict

**No A6 needed.** Cross-channel commutativity follows from:
- A1+A3 (partition × representation): composition universality + controlled ordering differences
- A3+A4 (representation × scale): deformation equivalence ensures observable agreement
- Trivial (partition × scale): independent parameter spaces

The commuting diagrams in RCP Section 2.2 are **consequences of A1-A5**, not additional axioms. The RCP framework is more economical than it appears: five axioms suffice for all three channels AND their pairwise interactions.
