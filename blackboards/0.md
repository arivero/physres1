# Stage 1 Forcing: Does Classical Path Concatenation Force Local Lagrangian?

## 1. Setup

**P4.2 (Stage 2):** (C) + (D) + (I) forces κ = ℏ in the quantum propagator.
This is a forcing theorem for the QUANTUM composition law (partition channel).

**Stage 1 question:** Does the CLASSICAL analog force anything?

**Classical composition law (path concatenation):**
For paths γ: [t_i, t_f] → ℝ^d:
    S[γ_{if}] = S[γ_{im}] + S[γ_{mf}]
for any intermediate time t_m.

This is the classical analog of (A1): action is additive under temporal partition.

**Question (Q_cl-a):** Does this additivity FORCE L to be local (L = L(q,q̇,t))?

## 2. Locality Forcing from Additivity

### 2.1 What "local" means

A local Lagrangian: S = ∫_{t_i}^{t_f} L(q(t), q̇(t), t) dt.

A non-local Lagrangian example: S = ∫∫ K(q(t), q(t'), t, t') dt dt' (Wyld-type).

**Observation:** Additivity S[γ_{if}] = S[γ_{im}] + S[γ_{mf}] is compatible with BOTH local and non-local actions IF the kernel K(t, t') is supported on the same temporal interval.

**But:** For a non-local action:
    S[γ_{if}] = ∫_{t_i}^{t_f} ∫_{t_i}^{t_f} K(q(t),q(t'),t,t') dt dt'

Splitting at t_m:
    S[γ_{im}] + S[γ_{mf}]
    = ∫_{t_i}^{t_m} ∫_{t_i}^{t_m} K dt dt' + ∫_{t_m}^{t_f} ∫_{t_m}^{t_f} K dt dt'

But S[γ_{if}] also contains CROSS TERMS: ∫_{t_i}^{t_m} ∫_{t_m}^{t_f} K(t,t') dt dt'.

**For additivity to hold:** these cross terms must vanish for ALL intermediate times t_m and ALL paths γ.

### 2.2 When do cross terms vanish?

Cross terms vanish ↔ K(t, t') = 0 for t < t_m < t' (for ALL t_m).

This requires K(t, t') = 0 for t ≠ t' — i.e., K is supported on the DIAGONAL t = t'.

**Diagonal support:** K(t, t') = L(q(t), q̇(t), t) · δ(t - t').

This gives: S = ∫ L(q(t), q̇(t), t) dt — the LOCAL Lagrangian.

### 2.3 Claim (Q_cl-a, provisional)

**Theorem CL-1 (provisional):**
IF S[γ_{if}] = S[γ_{im}] + S[γ_{mf}] for ALL paths γ and ALL intermediate times t_m,
AND S is a bilinear functional (second-order in path),
THEN S = ∫ L(q(t), q̇(t), t) dt for some function L.

**Proof sketch:**
The composition law is equivalent to: S has no cross-time correlations.
A bilinear functional without cross-time correlations must be diagonal in time.
The diagonal bilinear functional on paths is exactly the local action.

**First-order in path velocity:** by the chain rule on γ, L depends on q̇ (up to total derivatives).

## 3. What the Classical Forcing Does NOT Give

**Q_cl-b: Does locality alone force the equations of motion?**
NO. L(q, q̇, t) is unconstrained. Any local Lagrangian gives a well-posed variational problem.
The Euler-Lagrange equations follow from δS = 0, but the FORM of L is not forced.

**Q_cl-c: Does anything force L to be at most SECOND ORDER in derivatives?**
YES — but only with an additional axiom:

**Axiom (Ostrogradsky stability):** The physical system has a Hamiltonian bounded from below.
Higher-derivative Lagrangians (L containing q̈, q⃛, ...) lead to Ostrogradsky instability:
the canonical Hamiltonian is unbounded below (ghost states).

IF we impose Hamiltonian stability, THEN:
- L can depend on q̇ at most (not q̈ or higher)
- For free particles: L = αq̇² + βq + γ (quadratic in velocity)

**This is already the P4.2 setup:** at Stage 2, the path integral is for a particle with L = m q̇²/2 - V(q).

## 4. Connection to Four-Stage Forcing Table

| Stage | Composition | Extra axiom | Forced |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 (classical) | S additive (C_cl) | Bilinearity + no cross terms | Locality: L = L(q,q̇,t) |
| 1+ (stability) | + Ostrogradsky | Hamiltonian bounded below | Second-order: L = L(q,q̇) |
| 2 (QM) | K composition (C) | (D) + (I) | κ = ℏ |
| 3 (CFT) | Segal sewing (C) | Virasoro algebra | c/24 |
| 4 (TQFT) | Cobordism (C) | Unitarity + normalization | q = e^{2πi/(k+g∨)} |

**Key observation:** Stage 1 is a forcing theorem for locality, not for the equations of motion.
The equations of motion (Euler-Lagrange) come from variational calculus (δS = 0), which is
an additional principle (stationarity), not from composition alone.

**The cornerstone's chain:** Newton (F = ma, Stage 0) → action principle (δS = 0, Stage 1) → path integral (K composition, Stage 2).
At Stage 0→1: the action principle is NOT forced by composition — it is an independent empirical postulate (or mathematical elegance argument).
At Stage 1→2: once the action is given, path integral composition IS forced (P4.2).

## 5. The TRUE Stage 1 Gap

**What IS forced by classical composition:**
- Locality of L (CL-1 above): additive S forces L = local Lagrangian.
- No coupling between disjoint temporal segments.

**What is NOT forced:**
- Which L (the dynamics; this is physical content, like ℏ or c)
- The variational principle δS = 0 (an additional axiom)
- Ostrogradsky stability (an additional axiom about ground state)

**Comparison with Stage 2:**
At Stage 2, P4.2 forces BOTH locality (the kernel K is a function of endpoints, not paths)
AND the quantization constant ℏ (from dimensional homogeneity).
At Stage 1, composition forces locality of L, but NOT the dynamics (L itself).

**Conclusion:** Stage 1 forcing is WEAKER than Stage 2 forcing.
Stage 2's power comes from combining: composition + dimensional homogeneity + identity limit.
Stage 1's composition alone gives only locality.

## 6. Sev-3 Observation: Locality as Stage 1 P4.2 Analog

**Parallel (sev-3, physicist):**
At Stage 2, P4.2 says: (C) + (D) forces the NORMALIZATION EXPONENT t^{-d/2}.
At Stage 1, CL-1 says: (C_cl) + BILINEARITY forces L to be LOCAL.

The bilinearity assumption is the Stage 1 analog of (D) [dimensional homogeneity].
Both are "kinematic" constraints — they restrict the FORM of the functional, not its content.

**This suggests:** The cornerstone §3-4 could add a remark:
"Classical composition (additivity of S) forces the Lagrangian to be local — the Stage 1 analog of
P4.2's forcing of the propagator structure. The equations of motion (δS = 0) are an additional
variational axiom not forced by composition alone."

## Status

Physicist, self-directed (Task #19). Sev-3 conceptual.
- CL-1 is a new framing of a known result (locality of action ↔ no cross terms), useful for the paper's Stage 1 narrative.
- The forcing is WEAKER at Stage 1 than Stage 2 (content vs form).
- Proposed remark for cornerstone §3 (Newton→action section): one sentence on composition forcing locality.
