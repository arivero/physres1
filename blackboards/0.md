# Blackboard 0 — Pegg-Barnett hermitian phase operator (Section 2, action-angle)

## Target
Remark 2.3 in action-angle paper, after Remark 2.2 (Phase POVM),
before Section 3.

## Core content

Remark 2.2 uses a POVM to give rigorous angle probabilities. The
Pegg-Barnett (1989) approach takes a different route: define a hermitian
phase operator directly in a truncated (s+1)-dimensional Hilbert space,
take the limit s→∞ only after computing expectation values.

Construction:
- In the truncated space span{|0⟩,...,|s⟩}, define (s+1) orthonormal
  phase states |θ_m⟩ = (s+1)^{-1/2} Σ_{n=0}^{s} e^{inθ_m} |n⟩,
  where θ_m = θ_0 + 2πm/(s+1), m = 0,...,s.
- The Hermitian phase operator is:
  Φ_PB = Σ_{m=0}^{s} θ_m |θ_m⟩⟨θ_m|
- This is a well-defined self-adjoint operator in the truncated space.
- Expectation values and moments are computed in the truncated space,
  then s→∞ is taken.

Key points:
1. In the truncated space, number and phase are perfectly conjugate:
   the (s+1) number states and (s+1) phase states form two mutually
   unbiased bases.
2. The PB phase operator reproduces the POVM results of Remark 2.2
   for all physical states (those in the original l²(N₀) Hilbert space)
   in the s→∞ limit.
3. The approach sidesteps the Pauli/Susskind-Glogower obstruction
   by never requiring a self-adjoint operator in the infinite-dimensional
   space — only in finite truncations.
4. For a Fock state |n⟩, the PB phase distribution is uniform
   (as required). For a coherent state, it's peaked at arg(α).
5. The number-phase commutator [N, Φ_PB] ≠ iI in the truncated space
   (it has corrections of order 1/(s+1)), but in the s→∞ limit for
   physical matrix elements, it reproduces the canonical commutation
   relation results.

Connection to the paper:
- Directly extends Remark 2.2: POVM gives probabilities without a
  self-adjoint operator; PB gives a self-adjoint operator by truncation
  and limiting.
- Both approaches confirm the same physics: sharp number ↔ uniform phase.
- The truncation-then-limit procedure echoes the "uncuttable" theme of
  the companion paper: the phase operator is not captured by any finite
  truncation but is defined as a limiting procedure.
- Connects to Remark 6.9 (Bargmann): the PB phase states are the finite
  analog of the coherent-state resolution of identity.
