# Overclaiming Diagnostic: Mathematician's Assessment

Date: 2026-02-20
Task: #29 (self-directed)
Source: notebooks/cross-paper-overclaiming-diagnostic.md (Critic)
Scope: logical status of each instance — theorem vs. organizational claim

## Preliminary: What "forces" means mathematically

In mathematical usage: "A forces B" means A → B as a logical/mathematical theorem,
with explicitly stated hypotheses, derivable by proof. It is NOT:
- "A is consistent with B"
- "B is the natural/elegant choice given A"
- "B fits the A-narrative"

The Critic is right: the manuscripts use "forces" in the organizational sense.
The mathematician's job: identify which "forces" claims are actually theorems.

## Instance 2.1: Cornerstone P9.1 — "H0.2 obstructions reappear at higher levels"

**Critic's diagnosis:** H0.2 has 3 obstructions; P9.1 lists 4 different failures.
Mapping not justified.

**Mathematician's assessment: CORRECT — this is not a theorem.**

H0.2 obstructions (from motivations.md context): measurement, anomalies, UV divergence.
P9.1 failures: open systems, measurement, anomalies, UV divergence.

The mapping "P9.1 failure X = H0.2 obstruction Y" requires:
- A bijection between the two lists (fails: 4≠3)
- A proof that each mapping is more than nominal (not provided)

**Status: organizational/narrative claim. Not a theorem.**

Fix: "P9.1 identifies four categories of compositional failure, three of which correspond
to the H0.2 obstructions; the fourth (open systems) is an independent extension."
This is weaker and accurate.

## Instance 2.2: Path-integral-normalization — "Three independent arguments converge on d/2"

**Critic's diagnosis:** One argument in three guises. Non-independence admitted at line 408.

**Mathematician's assessment: PARTIALLY CORRECT, with a distinction.**

The three "arguments" are:
(A) Composition semigroup functional equation → t^{-d/2} normalization
(B) Dimensional homogeneity → [K] = L^{-d} → t^{-d/2} from [m/t]^{d/2}
(C) Half-density structure → coordinate-independence requires d/2 power

Are these independent?

- (A) and (B): NOT independent in the strong sense. (B) is derivable from (A) on ℝ^d
  (the composition integral forces [K] = L^{-d}, as shown in D50, blackboard 0 of prior session).
  However, (B) provides an independent VERIFICATION route — it reaches d/2 without invoking
  the semigroup functional equation, only dimensional analysis.

- (A) and (C): PARTIALLY independent. (C) is a geometric statement (half-density → bi-half-density
  kernel → coordinate-invariant composition), while (A) is analytic (functional equation).
  In flat space with Lebesgue measure they give the same d/2. In curved space, (C) gives
  Δ^{1/2}·(m/2πℏt)^{d/2} while (A) must be applied to the Van Vleck kernel. They are
  compatible but use different structure.

**Revised status:** Two routes to d/2 — analytic (composition/Fourier) and geometric
(half-density/coordinate-invariance). These are genuinely different in structure, though
they agree numerically. The word "independent" is too strong; "complementary" is accurate.

Fix: "Two structurally distinct routes — functional-equation and geometric — both force d/2.
Their agreement is a nontrivial consistency check." Remove "independent" and "converge."

## Instance 2.3: Ordering-equivalence — "Half-density as canonical gauge, analogous to Lorenz gauge"

**Critic's diagnosis:** Lorenz gauge is exact; ordering equivalence is approximate (Layer 3).

**Mathematician's assessment: CORRECT — the analogy fails at Layer 3.**

Precise statement:

Lorenz gauge ∇·A = 0 is an EXACT gauge condition — it holds identically, not approximately.
The residual freedom after Lorenz gauge fixing is ∇²λ = 0 (harmonic functions), which can be
further constrained. There are no "O(coupling)" corrections to the gauge condition itself.

Half-density as "canonical gauge" for ordering:
- Layer 1 (principal symbol): EXACT. All orderings agree. Exact invariance.
- Layer 2 (connection term): EXACT for half-density. Half-density uniquely eliminates the
  first-derivative term. This IS an exact selection, not approximate.
- Layer 3 (scalar potential): APPROXIMATE. Half-density gives a specific O(ℏ²) scalar
  correction, but other orderings give different O(ℏ²) corrections. These are not gauge-
  related — they correspond to physically inequivalent operators at order ℏ².

**Conclusion:** The Lorenz gauge analogy is valid at Layers 1-2 (exact elimination) but
breaks at Layer 3 (inequivalent corrections). The analogy should be stated with this scope.

Fix: "Half-density is the canonical representative at Layer 2 (connection-term elimination)
— analogous to Lorenz gauge in that it is the unique symmetric prescription at this layer.
Layer 3 differences are physical, not gauge, and lie outside this analogy."

## Instance 2.4: RCP-foundations — "RCP forces Noether's theorem existence"

**Critic's diagnosis:** Noether's theorem follows from action + symmetry, not from A1 (composition).

**Mathematician's assessment: CORRECT — this is a significant overclaim.**

Precise logical status:

Noether's theorem: If S[q] is invariant under a one-parameter symmetry group, then
∂L/∂q̇ · ξ is conserved on extremal paths. Proof: variational principle + Euler-Lagrange.

What does A1 (composition) add?
- A1 says K_{t₁+t₂} = K_{t₁}∘K_{t₂} (semigroup of propagators)
- Noether's theorem is about the action functional, not about propagators
- The connection is: symmetry of action → symmetry of K (if H commutes with symmetry generator)
  → Noether charge is conserved
- But this connection uses the action principle and Euler-Lagrange, NOT composition

**Composition is COMPATIBLE with Noether's theorem but does not DERIVE it.**

The claim "RCP forces Noether's existence as the compatibility datum" conflates:
- The fact that symmetry-compatible theories exist (Noether's content)
- The RCP framing that the charge is what "updates" under partition refinement

The RCP framing adds organizational clarity: the Noether charge is the parameter that
makes symmetry survive partition refinement. But the EXISTENCE of the charge is Noether's
theorem, provable without RCP.

**Logical dependency graph:**
```
Action principle + symmetry → Noether's theorem (independent of RCP)
RCP (A1) + Noether's theorem → "Noether charge is the compatibility datum" (organizational)
```
The arrow does NOT run: RCP → Noether. It runs the other way for the existence part.

Fix: "Noether's theorem guarantees the existence of the compatibility datum Q. RCP identifies Q
as the parameter that must be updated under partition refinement for symmetry to survive.
RCP explains WHY Q matters for refinement compatibility; Noether's theorem proves Q exists."

## New Instance: "Composition forces ℏ" (the main P4.2 claim)

This is the project's central claim. The Critic calls it a genuine theorem (Section 5.1).
Let me verify it precisely.

**Precise theorem statement (after this session's analysis):**

Given: pair groupoid composition on ℝ^d, Minkowski action-based dynamics with mass m,
measurable kernel ĥ ∈ L¹_loc in t, ĥ(p;t) ≠ 0.

Then: the unique kernel family satisfying (C) is K ∝ (m/2πiℏt)^{d/2} exp(iS_cl/ℏ)
where ℏ is the unique constant with [action] dimension constructible from the setup.

**Is "forces" justified here? YES, with precision:**
- "Composition forces exponential form": theorem (D29, Cauchy + Fourier multiplicativity)
- "Composition forces d/2": theorem (semigroup functional equation, Section 2.2 of PN paper)
- "Physical setup forces [K]=L^{-d}": theorem (dimensional consistency of composition integral)
- "Minkowski setup forces c₀=i": theorem (real positive c₀ diverges; Minkowski selects over Euclidean)
- "Setup forces κ=ℏ": theorem (unique action-dimensional constant from {m})
- "κ→0 fails": theorem (oscillatory divergence of nascent delta)
- "κ→∞ fails": theorem (weights trivialize)

**All nine conclusions of P4.2 are provable theorems.** The "forces" language is JUSTIFIED
for P4.2 itself. The Critic correctly identifies P4.2 as the project's genuine theorem.

The overclaiming pattern applies to the EXTENSION of P4.2 language to other topics
(Noether, independent-argument convergence, etc.), not to P4.2 itself.

## Recommendation for Paper Editing Pass

Priority order (highest impact on referee defensibility):

1. **2.4 Noether** — highest risk. A referee will immediately ask "how does RCP force
   Noether's theorem?" Fix: separate existence (Noether's theorem) from role (RCP framing).
   Affects: rcp-foundations Section 3.3, cornerstone wherever Noether is called a
   "compatibility datum forced by RCP."

2. **2.1 H0.2 map** — moderate risk. Mismatch in counts (3 vs 4) is factually wrong.
   Fix: state 3-of-4 correspondence, flag open systems as extension.
   Affects: cornerstone Section 9.6 P9.1 paragraph.

3. **2.3 Lorenz gauge** — low risk (analogy is labeled as analogy). But scope boundary needed.
   Fix: one sentence clarifying Layers 1-2 vs Layer 3.
   Affects: ordering-equivalence paper, Section introduction.

4. **2.2 "three independent"** — wording fix only. Low risk.
   Fix: "two structurally complementary routes."
   Affects: path-integral-normalization paper.
