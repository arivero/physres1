# Number-Phase Uncertainty: The Radial Action-Angle Pair
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S152

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 2 (after the canonical shift relation [L_z, E]=ℏE, before Section 3). The paper's core argument uses the azimuthal (φ, L_z) pair. The oscillator counterpart — the number-phase pair (n, θ) — encounters exactly the same mathematical structure: the number operator N = â†â has integer spectrum (like L_z), and the phase is periodic (like φ). The Susskind-Glogower operators play the role of E = e^{iφ}.

## Key Claims

### The number-phase problem
For the harmonic oscillator, the "action" is the number operator N = â†â (up to (n+½)ℏ), and the "angle" is the oscillation phase θ. Naively, [N, θ] = -i, but θ as a self-adjoint operator on the Fock space is problematic for the same reason as φ on the circle: N is bounded below (n ≥ 0), so there is no unitary operator e^{iθ} satisfying [N, e^{iθ}] = -e^{iθ} exactly.

### Susskind-Glogower operators (1964)
The resolution: define the "exponential phase" operators

  E₊ = Σ_{n=0}^∞ |n⟩⟨n+1| = (N+1)^{-1/2} â

  E₋ = E₊† = â† (N+1)^{-1/2} = Σ_{n=0}^∞ |n+1⟩⟨n|

These satisfy:
- E₋ E₊ = I (the identity)
- E₊ E₋ = I - |0⟩⟨0| (missing the vacuum projection)
- [N, E₊] = -E₊ (the lowering relation)
- [N, E₋] = +E₋ (the raising relation)

The failure of E₊ E₋ = I (the vacuum obstruction) is the Fock-space manifestation of the same issue that prevents a self-adjoint angle operator on [0, 2π): the spectrum of N is bounded below, so the shift operator cannot be unitary.

### Connection to the paper's treatment
1. **Exact parallel to Section 2**: The paper uses E = e^{iφ} with [L_z, E] = ℏE to avoid the self-adjoint angle operator problem. The Susskind-Glogower E₊ plays exactly the same role for (N, θ): it is the well-defined unitary-like operator that captures the phase information without requiring a self-adjoint θ.

2. **Fock state ↔ L_z eigenstate**: A Fock state |n⟩ has uniform phase distribution (the "ring" of Remark 6.4), just as an |ℓ,m⟩ eigenstate has uniform φ distribution (Section 3). The Susskind-Glogower E₊ applied to |n⟩ gives |n-1⟩ (for n ≥ 1) — it shifts the number by one, just as E = e^{iφ} shifts m by one.

3. **The vacuum asymmetry**: The one difference from the circle: E₊|0⟩ = 0 (cannot lower below vacuum), while e^{iφ}|m=-ℓ⟩ merely wraps to |m=+ℓ⟩ in finite-dimensional representations. This asymmetry reflects the semi-infinite nature of the Fock space (n ∈ {0,1,2,...}) versus the compact circle (m ∈ Z periodic).

### Pegg-Barnett phase (1989)
Alternative approach: truncate the Fock space to {|0⟩,...,|s⟩} and define θ as a self-adjoint operator on this finite space, then take s→∞. The finite-dimensional phase states form a Fourier pair with the number states (exactly as on a (2s+1)-point lattice), and the uncertainty relations become exact. In the limit s→∞, the Pegg-Barnett results reproduce the Susskind-Glogower framework.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 2.1, after the [L_z, E] = ℏE discussion in Section 2, before Section 3.

Content: The number-phase pair (N, θ) for the oscillator as the radial action-angle analog. Susskind-Glogower operators E₊ play the role of e^{iφ}: well-defined, capture the phase shift, but not unitary (E₊E₋ = I - |0⟩⟨0|) due to the bounded-below spectrum. Fock states have uniform phase (ring), coherent states have localized phase (blob) — the same structure as Sections 3-6, showing the φ/L_z witness is one instance of a general pattern.
