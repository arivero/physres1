# Callan-Symanzik Equation
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S178

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 4 (as Remark 4.9 after Remark 4.8 on dualities).
The Callan-Symanzik equation is the differential expression of refinement compatibility:
it states that physical observables are independent of the renormalization scale μ.

## Key Claims

### Statement
For a renormalized Green function Γ⁽ⁿ⁾ at momenta {p_i}, coupling g, and
renormalization scale μ:
  [μ ∂/∂μ + β(g) ∂/∂g + n γ(g)] Γ⁽ⁿ⁾ = 0
where β(g) = μ dg/dμ is the beta function and γ(g) is the anomalous dimension.

### Physical meaning
- The equation says: if you change the arbitrary renormalization scale μ, the
  coupling g and the field normalization must compensate to leave Γ⁽ⁿ⁾ unchanged.
- This is refinement compatibility in differential form: changing the "resolution"
  (μ) is compensated by flowing the coupling (β) and rescaling fields (γ).
- The beta function β(g) is the velocity field of the RG flow on coupling space.

### Connection to paper's themes
1. Direct mathematical expression of "the answer is independent of the regulator"
   — the mu-independence that Section 2's derivative example illustrates.
2. The anomalous dimension γ gives power-law corrections to naive dimensional
   analysis — a measurable consequence of the refinement prescription.
3. The equation unifies Examples 5.1-5.2 of the fermionic companion: the
   quadratic beta function of the 2D delta potential is the simplest instance.
