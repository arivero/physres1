# Real Spherical Harmonics: Simplest Angle-Localization Witness
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S139

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 3. Currently no remarks in Section 3 — just the statement that Lz eigenstates have uniform φ distribution. The real spherical harmonics provide the simplest illustration of the Fourier tradeoff within this section.

## Key Claims

### Complex vs Real Spherical Harmonics
The complex spherical harmonics Y_{l,m}(θ,φ) ∝ P_l^m(cos θ) e^{imφ} are Lz eigenstates with definite m. Their φ-dependence is purely e^{imφ}, so |Y_{l,m}|² is independent of φ (Section 3's main result).

The "real" spherical harmonics — used in chemistry (s, p_x, p_y, p_z, d_{xy}, etc.) — are the linear combinations:
  Y_{l,m}^c = (1/√2)(Y_{l,-m} + (-1)^m Y_{l,m})  ∝ P_l^m(cos θ) cos(mφ)
  Y_{l,m}^s = (i/√2)(Y_{l,-m} - (-1)^m Y_{l,m})  ∝ P_l^m(cos θ) sin(mφ)

These have φ-dependent probability distributions — angular lobes — because they are superpositions of two m-modes (m and -m).

### Connection to the paper's message
This is the simplest possible illustration of the Section 4 Fourier tradeoff, happening right inside Section 3:
- A single m-mode → uniform φ (Section 3 statement)
- Two m-modes (the minimal non-trivial superposition) → cos²(mφ) or sin²(mφ) angular lobes
- More modes (Section 4's Dirichlet kernel) → narrower peaks

The real harmonics are not Lz eigenstates — they're superpositions of Lz = +mℏ and Lz = -mℏ. The angular localization (lobes) comes at the cost of Lz indeterminacy: Var(Lz) = m²ℏ² for the real harmonics.

### Physical significance
In chemistry, the directional orbital shapes (p_x, p_y, d_{xy}, etc.) are exactly this: sacrificing definite angular momentum (no longer Lz eigenstates) to gain angular localization (lobed shapes suited to bonding directionality). The atomic physics convention (complex Y_{l,m}) prioritizes definite quantum numbers; the chemistry convention (real combinations) prioritizes spatial directionality.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 3.1, right after the Section 3 main statement about uniform φ-distribution, before Section 4.

Content: The "real" spherical harmonics (p_x, p_y, d_{xy}, etc.) are the minimal illustration of the tradeoff — superposing m and -m breaks azimuthal uniformity to create directional lobes, at the cost of Lz indeterminacy.
