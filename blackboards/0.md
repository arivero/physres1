# Resurgence and Trans-series
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S170

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 2 (after Remark 2.7 on zeta regularization).
Remarks 2.5–2.6 discuss Padé/Borel resummation and optimal truncation. Resurgence
goes deeper: the non-perturbative content (instantons, tunneling) is encoded in the
large-order behavior of the perturbative coefficients — they are not independent.

## Key Claims

### Divergent series encode non-perturbative physics (Bender-Wu 1969)
For the anharmonic oscillator E(g) = Σ a_n g^n, Bender and Wu showed
a_n ~ (-1)^{n+1} C · A^{-n} · n!, with A the instanton action. The factorial
growth rate is precisely the instanton action. Not a coincidence: follows from
saddle-point structure of the path integral.

### Écalle's resurgence (1981)
A formal power series is "resurgent" if its Borel transform has only isolated
singularities, each decorated with further resurgent series. Alien calculus
(Δ_ω for singular point ω) encodes how perturbative series "knows about"
non-perturbative sectors. Full answer is a trans-series:
  f(z) = Σ_{n≥0} σ^n e^{-nA/z} Σ_k a_{n,k} z^k
Each instanton sector has its own perturbative tail.

### Connection to paper's themes
1. Explains WHY optimal truncation (Remark 2.6) leaves exponentially small
   remainder — it's the instanton contribution
2. Trans-series is ultimate "uncuttable" object: no single perturbative sector
   suffices; needs all instanton sectors tied by Stokes phenomena
3. Connects to Remark 4.1 (Wilson RG): UV renormalons are Borel-plane
   singularities encoding power corrections

## Proposed Remark
Remark 2.8 in uncuttable (after Remark 2.7).
