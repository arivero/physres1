# Blackboard 0 — Heat kernel as bi-half-density (Section 4, half-density QFT)

## Target
Remark HD-D4.2 in half-density QFT paper, after Remark HD-D4.1 (doubling),
before Section 5.

## Core content

The heat kernel K(t; x, y) of the operator P (e.g., -∇² + m² + ξR) satisfies
(∂_t + P_x) K(t; x, y) = 0 with initial condition K(0; x, y) = δ(x, y)/√|g(y)|.

> [REVIEWER] **Issue with initial condition**: This initial condition is correct for the scalar heat kernel acting on functions (the classical setup). However, there's a subtle point: the delta distribution δ(x,y) itself must be understood in coordinates, and the factor 1/√|g(y)| is necessary to make ∫_M K(0; x, y) f(y) √|g(y)| d^D y = f(x). The initial condition is distributional; writing it this way is standard but requires care when transforming to the half-density picture below.
The DeWitt-Schwinger asymptotic expansion (t → 0⁺) is:

  K(t; x, y) ~ (4πt)^{-D/2} Δ^{1/2}(x,y) exp(-σ(x,y)/(2t)) Σ_n a_n(x,y) t^n

where:
- σ(x,y) is Synge's world function (half the squared geodesic distance)
- Δ(x,y) = -|g(x)|^{-1/2} det(-∂²σ/∂x∂y) |g(y)|^{-1/2} is the Van Vleck
  determinant (VVD)
- a_n(x,y) are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients (smooth biscalars)
- a_0(x,x) = 1 (normalization)

> [REVIEWER] **VVD sign convention**: The minus sign in the determinant det(-∂²σ/∂x∂y) is correct for Riemannian signature. In Lorentzian signature, this formula requires analytic continuation (Wick rotation t → -iτ) and the VVD definition changes accordingly. The expansion as written is valid for **elliptic operators on Riemannian manifolds**. For Lorentzian QFT, one typically works with the Euclidean heat kernel and analytically continues Green's functions afterward.
>
> **VVD definition precision**: The VVD is also denoted D(x,y) in some literature. The formula Δ(x,y) = |g(x)|^{-1/2} |det(-∂²σ/∂x^μ∂y^ν)| |g(y)|^{-1/2} with absolute value is more careful (ensuring positivity). For geodesically convex neighborhoods, the determinant is positive and the absolute value can be dropped.

Key half-density observation: The VVD is precisely the Jacobian that makes the
heat kernel a bi-half-density. Define the half-density heat kernel:

  K̃(t; x, y) = |g(x)|^{1/4} K(t; x, y) |g(y)|^{1/4}

Then the leading short-time behavior is:

  K̃(t; x, y) ~ (4πt)^{-D/2} |g(x)|^{1/4} Δ^{1/2}(x,y) |g(y)|^{1/4} exp(-σ/(2t))

The combination |g(x)|^{1/4} Δ^{1/2}(x,y) |g(y)|^{1/4} is the bi-half-density
version of the VVD, and it satisfies a transport equation along geodesics
(the Van Vleck equation).

> [REVIEWER] **Half-density heat kernel subtlety**: The definition K̃(t; x, y) = |g(x)|^{1/4} K(t; x, y) |g(y)|^{1/4} is indeed the natural bi-half-density version, BUT one must be careful: this is a **derived** bi-half-density kernel from the scalar heat kernel. The **intrinsic** heat kernel for an operator acting on half-densities (e.g., P̃ = |g|^{-1/4} P |g|^{1/4}) would have a different initial condition: K̃(0; x, y) = δ(x, y) (no metric factor), since half-densities integrate without √|g|.
>
> The claim "the VVD is precisely the Jacobian" is **geometrically correct**: Δ^{1/2}(x,y) is the parallel transport Jacobian for half-density bundles along geodesics. More precisely, the VVD satisfies the transport equation (∇_x^μ + ∇_y^μ) Δ^{1/2} = 0, which ensures that |g(x)|^{1/4} Δ^{1/2}(x,y) |g(y)|^{1/4} transforms as a bi-half-density under coordinate changes.
>
> **Missing point**: The full bi-half-density heat kernel should be K̃(t; x, y) = |g(x)|^{1/4} Δ^{1/2}(x,y) |g(y)|^{1/4} × (4πt)^{-D/2} exp(-σ/(2t)) Σ_n a_n(x,y) t^n, where the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients a_n are now viewed as biscalars (which they are). The prefactor structure shows that Δ^{1/2} "upgrades" the exponential Gaussian into a proper bi-half-density.

At coincidence (x = y):
- σ(x,x) = 0
- Δ(x,x) = 1
- K̃(t; x, x) ~ (4πt)^{-D/2} [1 + a_1(x,x) t + a_2(x,x) t² + ...]

The prefactor (4πt)^{-D/2} matches exactly the normalization of Derivation
HD-D1.1a — the Gaussian approximate identity. The heat kernel IS the
time-parameterized regularization of the identity kernel:
K̃(t) → K̃_Id as t → 0⁺.

> [REVIEWER] **Coincidence limit correct**: The limits σ(x,x) = 0 and Δ(x,x) = 1 are standard. These follow from: (1) σ is O(d²) where d is geodesic distance, and (2) Δ(x,x) = 1 by the definition of the VVD (it's normalized so the Jacobian at coincidence is unity).
>
> **Limit interpretation**: The statement "K̃(t) → K̃_Id as t → 0⁺" must be understood **distributionally**. The convergence is in the sense of distributions acting on smooth test functions: ∫_M K̃(t; x, y) φ(y) d^D y → φ(x) as t → 0⁺ for smooth φ with compact support. Pointwise convergence fails (the heat kernel is singular at t=0).

Connection to the paper:
- Makes explicit that the propagator (Section 4) has a natural bi-half-density
  form at the level of its short-time/UV structure
- The VVD is the geometric content that makes composition coordinate-free
  (Section 2's main point, now for the heat kernel)
- The Seeley-DeWitt coefficients a_n encode curvature invariants that appear
  as counterterms in Section 5: a_1 = (1/6 - ξ)R gives the conformal coupling
  counterterm; a_2 involves R², R_μν R^μν, □R — the dimension-4 counterterms
  of renormalization on curved backgrounds
- The (4πt)^{-D/2} prefactor connects to D1.1a's normalization argument

> [REVIEWER] **Seeley-DeWitt coefficient formulas**: The formula a_1(x,x) = (1/6 - ξ)R is correct for the operator P = -∇² + m² + ξR acting on scalar functions. For the conformal coupling ξ = (D-2)/(4(D-1)), the coefficient becomes a_1(x,x) = [(D-2)/(4(D-1)) - 1/6]R. In D=4, this gives a_1 = (1/6 - 1/6)R = 0 for ξ = 1/6, which is the conformal coupling.
>
> **Coefficient a_2**: The structure of a_2 is indeed R², R_μν R^μν, □R plus lower-order terms (m⁴, m²R, etc.). The precise formula is lengthy; see Gilkey or Vassilevich for explicit expressions.

## Functional determinant connection

The heat kernel also defines the functional determinant via:

  -ln det P = ∫_0^∞ (dt/t) Tr K(t)  [with suitable regularization]

where Tr K(t) = ∫_M K(t; x, x) √|g| d^D x = ∫_M K̃(t; x, x) d^D x.

The second equality shows that in the half-density formulation, the trace
is just the coordinate integral of the diagonal kernel — no √|g| needed.
This connects to the zeta-function regularization: ζ_P(s) = ∫_0^∞ t^{s-1}
Tr K(t) dt / Γ(s), and ln det P = -ζ'_P(0).

> [REVIEWER] **Functional determinant formula**: The formula -ln det P = ∫_0^∞ (dt/t) Tr K(t) is **formally correct** but requires careful interpretation:
> 1. The integral diverges at both t→0⁺ (UV divergence from short-time expansion) and t→∞ (IR divergence from small eigenvalues).
> 2. "Suitable regularization" typically means: (a) zeta-function regularization (ζ_P(s) analytically continued to s=0), or (b) cutoff regularization with counterterm subtraction.
> 3. The relation ln det P = -ζ'_P(0) is rigorous for elliptic operators with discrete spectrum (e.g., compact manifolds without boundary, or suitable boundary conditions).
>
> **Trace equality**: The equality Tr K(t) = ∫_M K(t; x, x) √|g| d^D x = ∫_M K̃(t; x, x) d^D x is **correct** and demonstrates the advantage of the half-density picture: the trace is literally the integral of the diagonal kernel, with no auxiliary measure factor. This is the "right" way to think about traces of integral operators on curved spaces.

## [REVIEWER] Overall Assessment

**Mathematical correctness**: The core content is **correct** but requires the caveats noted above:
1. The expansion is for **elliptic operators on Riemannian manifolds**. Lorentzian QFT requires Wick rotation.
2. The VVD definition needs care with signs/absolute values (geodesically convex neighborhoods assumed).
3. The half-density heat kernel K̃ is a **derived** quantity from the scalar heat kernel; intrinsic half-density operators have different initial conditions.
4. All distributional limits must be understood in the sense of test functions, not pointwise.

**Precision improvements needed**:
- Clarify that Δ^{1/2}(x,y) is the **parallel transport Jacobian** for half-densities, satisfying (∇_x^μ + ∇_y^μ) Δ^{1/2} = 0.
- Emphasize that the VVD makes the heat kernel a bi-half-density **up to the scalar prefactor** (4πt)^{-D/2} exp(-σ/(2t)) Σ a_n t^n.
- The functional determinant formula requires analytic continuation of the zeta function and is only rigorous for suitable operator domains.

**Pedagogical strength**: The blackboard note effectively connects the heat kernel expansion to the half-density QFT framework. The observation that Tr K(t) = ∫ K̃(t; x, x) d^D x (no √|g|) is a **key conceptual point** that justifies the half-density approach.

**Recommendation for paper**: This material is suitable for Remark HD-D4.2. Suggest adding:
1. A sentence clarifying the Riemannian/Euclidean context (Wick rotation if needed for Lorentzian QFT).
2. A phrase noting that Δ^{1/2}(x,y) is the "parallel transport Jacobian for half-densities" (connects to Section 2's composition discussion).
3. Optional: A forward reference to Section 5's counterterms, noting that a_1, a_2 encode the curvature invariants that appear as UV divergences.
