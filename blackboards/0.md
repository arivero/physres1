# Blackboard 0 — Zeno's paradoxes as refinement limits (Section 1, uncuttable)

## Target
Remark 1.2 in uncuttable paper, after Remark 1.1 (Cauchy completion),
before Section 2.

## Core content

The etymological note on "atomos" (line 18) mentions Leucippus and
Democritus. But the deeper Greek connection is to ZENO's paradoxes,
which are literally about refinement limits:

Zeno's dichotomy paradox: to reach a destination, one must first
traverse half the distance, then half of the remainder, etc. The sum
  1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... = 1
converges, but each partial sum is a "finite dissection" that does not
equal the destination. The resolution — that convergent infinite series
have well-defined limits — is precisely the "controlled refinement" of
Section 1's definition.

Achilles and the tortoise: same structure but with a geometric series
that depends on the speed ratio. Again, the partial sums form
approximants and the answer is the limit.

The arrow paradox is different: at each instant, the arrow occupies a
definite position, so how can it move? This is resolved by recognizing
that velocity is a refinement limit (the derivative), not a property
of a single instant — exactly the derivative-as-refinement-limit of
Example 2.1.

Connection to the paper:
- Zeno's paradoxes predated the Greek atomists; they were arguments
  AGAINST the possibility of motion under infinite divisibility
- The atomists' response (indivisible atoms) eliminates the infinite
  regression by fiat
- The paper's response (controlled refinement) keeps the infinite
  divisibility but adds a convergence structure — the modern analysis
  resolution via Cauchy/Weierstrass epsilon-delta definitions
- This historical arc: Zeno → atomists → analysis → modern physics
  perfectly frames the paper's thesis
