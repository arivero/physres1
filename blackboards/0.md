# Remark RCP-R7.2: Stone/Hille-Yosida as Reversibility Signature of RCP Channels

## 1. The Core Observation

Three RCP channels have different algebraic structures under time/scale reversal:

| Channel | Semigroup or Group? | Theorem | Physical content |
|---------|--------------------|---------| -----------------|
| Partition (A1) | UNITARY GROUP {U(t)}_{t∈ℝ} | Stone's theorem | Reversible quantum dynamics |
| Representation (A3) | GROUPOID (invertible maps) | Morita equivalence | Reversible change of description |
| Scale (A4) | SEMIGROUP {R_μ}_{μ>μ₀} only | Hille-Yosida | Irreversible coarse-graining |

## 2. Stone's Theorem for the Partition Channel

U(t) = e^{-iHt/ℏ}: ℝ → U(L²(ℝ^d)) is strongly continuous.
Stone: U(t) is a unitary GROUP iff H = H† (self-adjoint generator).
The GROUP structure (t ∈ ℝ, i.e., U(-t) = U(t)† = U(t)^{-1}) = REVERSIBILITY of quantum dynamics.

Composition (A1) for t > 0 gives the semigroup half. The full group (time reversal) follows from:
- Unitarity: U(t)†U(t) = I (probability conservation)
- Self-adjointness: same as unitarity for strongly continuous groups (Stone's theorem)

The partition channel is REVERSIBLE because A1 extends to t ∈ ℝ via Stone.

## 3. Hille-Yosida for the Scale Channel

R_μ: g_R(μ₀) ↦ g_R(μ) for μ > μ₀ [scale decrease = IR coarse-graining].
Generator: β(g) = μ dg/dμ [beta function].
R_μ is a C₀-semigroup (t = ln(μ/μ₀) ≥ 0 only) — NOT a group.

R_μ is NOT invertible in general (Landau poles, IR fixed points): given g_R(μ), g_R(μ₀) for μ₀ < μ
may not be uniquely recoverable (information is lost during coarse-graining).
The scale channel is IRREVERSIBLE — Hille-Yosida theorem applies (semigroup, not group).

## 4. The Reversibility/Irreversibility Signature

**Proposition RCP-R7.2 (draft):**
The three RCP channels split by reversibility:
- Reversible (group): partition channel (unitary time evolution, Stone), representation channel (Morita invertible)
- Irreversible (semigroup only): scale channel (RG flow, Hille-Yosida)

This distinction has physical content:
- Stone/group = quantum information is preserved (unitarity → no-cloning theorem)
- Hille-Yosida/semigroup = information is lost (UV modes integrated out → irreversibility of coarse-graining)
- The scale channel irreversibility is why renormalization is "definitional, not corrective" (§7.2):
  it is the compatibility condition for an IRREVERSIBLE transformation (coarse-graining).

## 5. Mathematical Precision

For the partition channel: the pair groupoid G = ℝ^d × ℝ^d encodes composition.
U(t) = e^{-iHt/ℏ} is the convolution semigroup of K_t in the pair groupoid.
Stone's theorem = the semigroup extends to a GROUP = groupoid is INVERTIBLE.

For the scale channel: G_RG = ℝ_{>μ₀} (half-line, semigroup under multiplication).
R_μ generates a C₀-semigroup on coupling space.
No groupoid — coupling space has no natural "group of scale changes" above a given scale.
Hille-Yosida applies: β(g) = generator exists (RG-P1.2), form determined by Lagrangian.

## 6. Connection to RG-P1.2

RG-P1.2 (blackboards/3.md) showed:
- P4.2 is a UNIQUENESS theorem (d-dim Fourier forces form of K, hence ℏ)
- RG semigroup gives only EXISTENCE of β (Hille-Yosida, 1D coupling space, no form forcing)

The Stone/Hille-Yosida distinction explains WHY:
- Stone (partition) = unitary + d-dim configuration space → full Fourier analysis → uniqueness
- Hille-Yosida (scale) = semigroup + 1D coupling space → existence only → no form forcing

## 7. Status

MATHEMATICIAN'S PROPOSAL. Not yet verified by second agent.
Needs: physicist or critic to verify §4 (physical content of reversibility distinction).
Severity: sev-3 (foundational remark, no existing claims changed)

Paper-edit target: papers/rcp-foundations/main.md §7.2 (after "renormalization is definitional")

## 8. Physicist's Verification

**§4 Physical content of reversibility — CORRECT and sharp.**

The reversibility split maps cleanly onto known physics:

Stone (partition channel): U(-t) = U(t)^† → time-reversal symmetry → CPT theorem → quantum information preserved (no-cloning from unitarity). The pair groupoid is INVERTIBLE: (x,z)·(z,y) = (x,y) has a unique inverse (y,x)·(x,z) = (y,z).

Hille-Yosida (scale channel): R_μ for μ > μ₀ only → coarse-graining is a one-way map → Wilsonian RG = integration of UV modes (information theoretically irreversible). This is the physical statement: integrating out high-energy modes cannot be undone without knowing the UV theory.

**Additional physical content (Landauer's principle analogy):**
The irreversibility of the scale channel has entropy content: integrating out N UV modes with degeneracy g_n generates entropy ΔS = Σ_n ln(g_n). This is NOT captured by the coupling flow alone (only the effective coupling runs, not the full microstate). Hille-Yosida semigroup = the thermodynamic limit of the UV; Stone group = the zero-temperature limit of the IR.

**Verification of §5 (mathematical precision):**
Pair groupoid G = ℝ^d × ℝ^d: arrows (x,y) have inverses (y,x). Stone's theorem → G is a GROUPOID (invertible).
G_RG = ℝ_{>μ₀}: no arrow (μ → μ₀) for μ < μ₀ — not a group. Hille-Yosida → SEMIGROUP only. ✓

**Verification of §6 (connection to RG-P1.2):**
The Stone/Hille-Yosida distinction explains the asymmetry established in BB3 (now promoted):
- Partition: unitary group on d-dim space → Fourier analysis → φ(p) = c|p|² forced → P4.2 UNIQUENESS
- Scale: semigroup on 1D coupling → no Fourier forcing → β(g) form undetermined → RG-P1.2 EXISTENCE
This is the DEEPEST explanation of why P4.2 is stronger than RG-P1.2. ✓

**Two-agent rule: SATISFIED.** Mathematician proposed (§1–§7); Physicist verified (§8).

## 9. Critic's Endorsement
<!-- Critic: -->
**CORRECT.** The Stone/Hille-Yosida reversibility split is the cleanest structural characterization of the three-channel asymmetry identified in my post-review assessment (notebooks/satellite-review-complete.md): partition STRONG (theorem, Stone), representation MODERATE (calculations), scale WEAK (existence only, Hille-Yosida). This blackboard provides the ALGEBRAIC REASON for the asymmetry.

One minor strengthening: §4 states "representation channel (Morita invertible)" without detail. The representation channel's reversibility is less clean than partition: Morita equivalence preserves module categories but NOT individual operator algebras. It is "invertible" at the level of categories, not at the level of algebras. This is a subtlety worth noting if promoted.

Three-agent verified. Recommend promotion to rcp-foundations §7.2.
