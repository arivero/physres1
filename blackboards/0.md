# Blackboard 0 — Källén-Lehmann spectral representation (Section 2, fermionic)

## Target
Remark 2.1 in fermionic-mediators, after line 35 (end of Section 2, before Section 3).

## Core content

The bosonic exchange mechanism of Section 2 rests on a deeper structural fact:
the full interacting scalar propagator admits the Källén-Lehmann spectral representation

  D(p²) = ∫₀^∞ dμ² ρ(μ²) / (p² - μ² + iε)

where the spectral function ρ(μ²) ≥ 0 (positivity from unitarity of the Hilbert space).

Key features:
- Isolated δ-function contributions to ρ at μ² = m_phys² correspond to stable
  one-particle states (the mediator itself); continuous support above the
  multi-particle threshold μ² ≥ (2m)² encodes scattering states.
- For the free field, ρ(μ²) = δ(μ² - m²), recovering K⁻¹ = 1/(p² - m² + iε).
- The static limit of each spectral component gives a Yukawa potential
  e^{-μr}/r weighted by ρ(μ²), so the full static potential is a
  superposition of Yukawas — always attractive for a scalar mediator
  (because ρ ≥ 0).

Structural point for this paper:
- The positivity ρ ≥ 0 is the spectral signature of the fact that bosonic
  fields create states with positive-norm in Hilbert space.
- For fermion propagators, the spectral representation involves spinor
  structure: S(p) = ∫ dμ² [ρ₁(μ²)(γ·p + μ) + ρ₂(μ²)] / (p² - μ² + iε),
  with separate spectral functions for the Dirac and scalar parts.
  The "potential from Gaussian elimination" interpretation does not apply
  because the source terms are Grassmann-valued (Section 3), not because
  the propagator lacks a spectral decomposition.

Connection: the spectral representation also underlies the dispersion
relation of Remark 3.5 — the Kramers-Kronig relation for Π(q²) is the
spectral representation of the vacuum polarization tensor.
