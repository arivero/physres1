# Half-Density Conjugation Potential in General Metrics: D=4 Selection
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S204

## Context
Open question #1 (docs/motivations.md): does half-density normalization
select d=4? HD-D1.3 shows D(4−D)(∂σ)² cancels at D=4 in the conformal
class, but this relies on the conformal ansatz. Here we derive a
general-metric result using Riemannian normal coordinates.

## Setup
On a Riemannian (M,g), the half-density conjugation of the scalar
Laplacian is
$$
\widetilde\Delta := |g|^{1/4}\,\Delta_g\,|g|^{-1/4}
  = \Delta_g - 2\,g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\omega\,\partial_\nu
  + V,
$$
where $\omega := \tfrac{1}{4}\ln|g|$ and the zeroth-order potential is
$$
V = |\nabla\omega|^2_g - \Delta_g\omega.
$$

## Derivation (Riemannian normal coordinates)
At the center $p$ of Riemannian normal coordinates, $g_{\mu\nu}(p) = \delta_{\mu\nu}$
and the metric determinant expands as (standard, see e.g. Berger 2003 §6.5):
$$
|g(x)| = 1 - \tfrac{1}{3}R_{\mu\nu}\,x^\mu x^\nu + O(x^3).
$$

**Step 1.** $\omega = \tfrac{1}{4}\ln|g| = -\tfrac{1}{12}R_{\mu\nu}\,x^\mu x^\nu + O(x^3)$.

**Step 2.** At $p$: $\partial_\alpha\omega\big|_p = 0$ (quadratic in $x$).

**Step 3.** Hessian: $\partial_\alpha\partial_\beta\omega\big|_p = -\tfrac{1}{6}R_{\alpha\beta}$
  (since $\partial_\alpha\partial_\beta(R_{\mu\nu}x^\mu x^\nu) = 2R_{\alpha\beta}$).

**Step 4.** Laplacian: $\Delta_g\omega\big|_p = \delta^{\alpha\beta}\cdot(-\tfrac{1}{6}R_{\alpha\beta}) = -\tfrac{1}{6}R$.

**Step 5.** $|\nabla\omega|^2\big|_p = 0$ (gradient vanishes).

**Step 6.** $V(p) = 0 - (-\tfrac{1}{6}R) = \tfrac{1}{6}R$.

**This holds for all D.** The result $V = \tfrac{1}{6}R$ is dimension-independent
(at leading curvature order).

## The D=4 selection
Conformal coupling is $\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} = (D-2)/(4(D-1))$, which equals
$1/6$ only when $D=4$:
$$
\frac{D-2}{4(D-1)} = \frac{1}{6}
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
6(D-2) = 4(D-1)
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
D = 4.
$$

**Table:**
| D | ξ_conf | V coeff | Match? |
|---|--------|---------|--------|
| 2 | 0      | 1/6     | No     |
| 3 | 1/8    | 1/6     | No     |
| 4 | 1/6    | 1/6     | **Yes**|
| 5 | 3/16   | 1/6     | No     |
| 6 | 1/5    | 1/6     | No     |

## Physical interpretation
For a scalar field with curvature coupling $\xi$, the half-density
operator is $\widetilde P = -\widetilde\Delta + \xi R$. The total
curvature potential at leading order is $(\xi - 1/6)R$.

In $D=4$ with conformal coupling ($\xi = 1/6$): the curvature potential
**cancels exactly** at leading order. The half-density equation is "as
flat as possible" — the half-density weight absorbs the conformal coupling.

In any other $D$: a residual curvature potential $(\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} - 1/6)R \ne 0$
remains, even for the conformally coupled scalar.

## Relation to HD-D1.3 (conformal class result)
HD-D1.3 shows that in the conformal class $g = e^{2\sigma}\delta$,
the $(\partial\sigma)^2$ coefficient is $D(4-D)/4$, which cancels at
$D=4$. That result is a special case: in the conformal class, the
$(\partial\sigma)^2$ term is the dominant correction when σ varies
slowly, and its coefficient encodes the same mismatch between
half-density weight and conformal weight.

The normal-coordinate computation is stronger: it shows the D=4
selection without assuming a conformal metric. The selection comes
from a universal property of Riemannian geometry (the determinant
expansion in normal coordinates).

## Connection to Seeley-DeWitt coefficient a₁
For the operator $P = -\nabla^2 + \xi R$, the first Seeley-DeWitt
coefficient at coincidence is $a_1(x,x) = (\tfrac{1}{6} - \xi)R$
(Vassilevich 2003, eq. 4.3). This is the same (1/6)R that appears in
the conjugation potential. The coincidence is not accidental: the
half-density conjugation and the heat kernel expansion probe the same
local geometry.

## Caveats
1. This is at **leading curvature order** only. Higher-order terms
   ($R^2$, $R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$, etc.) may introduce additional
   D-dependent effects.
2. The connection term $-2\nabla\omega\cdot\nabla$ vanishes at $p$
   but is nonzero away from the center. This is a gauge artifact
   (it can be absorbed into a redefinition of the covariant derivative
   on half-densities).
3. The result is **local** (pointwise). Global implications (e.g.,
   for the spectral zeta function or the Weyl anomaly) require
   integrating over $M$ and involve the full heat kernel expansion.

## SymPy verification
```python
from sympy import *
D = symbols('D')
xi_conf = (D - 2) / (4*(D - 1))
solve(Eq(xi_conf, Rational(1,6)), D)  # => [4]
```

## Proposed remark for HD-QFT paper
Add as Remark HD-D1.3b after HD-D1.3a. Title: "Normal-coordinate
computation: V = (1/6)R selects D=4." ~8-10 lines of prose + the
key equation. This makes the D=4 selection independent of the
conformal-class assumption.
