# Phase POVM: the Correct Framework for Angle Measurement
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S180

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 2 (as Remark 2.2 after Remark 2.1 on number-phase).
The paper avoids the "self-adjoint angle operator debate" by using E=e^{iφ}. But the
clean mathematical resolution is the POVM (positive operator-valued measure) for phase,
which provides a consistent probability distribution for angle outcomes without requiring
a self-adjoint operator.

## Key Claims

### The problem
There is no self-adjoint operator φ̂ on the oscillator/angular momentum Hilbert space
satisfying [N̂, φ̂] = -i (or [L_z, φ̂] = iℏ) because the spectrum of N̂ (or L_z/ℏ)
is bounded below (or discrete and unbounded). This is the Dirac-Pauli obstruction.

### POVM resolution
A POVM {dΠ(φ)} on [0,2π) provides a consistent probability measure:
  dΠ(φ) = (1/2π) Σ_{m,n} |m⟩⟨n| e^{i(m-n)φ} dφ
The probability of finding angle in [a,b] is:
  Pr(φ ∈ [a,b]) = Tr(ρ ∫_a^b dΠ(φ))
For a Fock state |n⟩: Pr is uniform (as in Section 3).
For a coherent state |α⟩: Pr is peaked at arg(α) (as in Example 6.1).

### Connection to the paper's themes
1. The POVM gives a rigorous meaning to "the angle probability distribution"
   without requiring a self-adjoint angle operator.
2. It recovers all the physical predictions of Sections 3-4 (uniform angle for
   Fock states, peaked angle for coherent states) within a mathematically
   rigorous framework.
3. The Susskind-Glogower operator E of Section 2 is related to the POVM by:
   ⟨E⟩ = ∫ e^{iφ} dΠ(φ), so the unitary approach and the POVM approach are
   consistent but the POVM is more general.
