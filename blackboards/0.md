# Dimensional Dependence of Contact Divergences
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S131

## Context
The fermionic mediators paper has Examples 5.1 (d=2 delta, logarithmic divergence,
dimensional transmutation) and 5.2 (d=3 delta, linear divergence, scattering length).
A synthesis remark comparing d=1,2,3 would tie these together and highlight how the
"control data" for the refinement limit changes with dimension.

## Key claims

1. **d=1: no renormalization needed.** In one spatial dimension, the delta potential
   V(x) = g δ(x) is well-defined as an operator perturbation. The scattering
   amplitude is f(k) = −mg/(ℏ²k + img) (transmission coefficient T = 1/(1+(mg/(ℏ²k))²)).
   The coupling g is simply a number — no UV divergence, no RG flow, no dimensional
   transmutation. A bound state exists for g < 0 with energy E = −mg²/(2ℏ²).

2. **d=2: logarithmic divergence → dimensional transmutation.** Already in Example
   5.1. The loop integral diverges logarithmically. Renormalization produces a beta
   function β(g_R) = (m/πℏ²)g_R², generating a dynamical scale
   μ* = μ exp(πℏ²/(mg_R)). The coupling is no longer a number but a flow.

3. **d=3: linear (power) divergence → scattering length.** Already in Example 5.2.
   The loop integral diverges linearly (∝ Λ). Renormalization absorbs the divergence
   into the physical scattering length a. The running coupling satisfies a different
   beta function structure.

4. **Pattern: critical dimension d=2.** The contact interaction C₀δ^(d)(r) has
   engineering dimension [C₀] = E·L^d in the amplitude. The loop integral
   ∫ d^d k/(k²−E) diverges for d ≥ 2, with logarithmic divergence at d=2
   (marginal coupling) and power divergence for d>2 (relevant coupling in the RG
   sense, requiring subtraction). At d=2 the coupling is classically marginal but
   quantum-mechanically relevant (asymptotic freedom of the inverse coupling).

5. **Structural lesson.** The same "contact limit" operator δ^(d)(r) requires
   qualitatively different control data across dimensions:
   - d=1: the coupling IS the complete data (a number).
   - d=2: the coupling is a flow, defining a scale (dimensional transmutation).
   - d=3: the coupling is a flow, defining a scattering length.
   This illustrates the dimension-dependence of the "extra structure" needed for
   the refinement limit: what is a well-posed operator in d=1 becomes a
   renormalization problem in d≥2.

## Proposed remark for fermionic mediators satellite
Remark 5.4 (~3 lines) after Remark 5.3 (unitarity limit). Compare d=1,2,3 behavior
of the same delta interaction. The point: the "control data" changes with dimension —
from a plain number (d=1) to a running coupling/scale (d≥2). Keep compact.

### Claim-by-claim verification

**Claim 1 (d=1 delta potential):** CORRECT WITH CAVEATS

The bound-state energy E = −mg²/(2ℏ²) for attractive coupling (g < 0) is standard and correct [Albeverio et al. 2005, §I.3.1].

However, the scattering amplitude formula f(k) = −mg/(ℏ²k + img) is **imprecise notation**. In 1D, "scattering amplitude" usually refers to transmission/reflection coefficients, not a 3D-style f(k). The transmission coefficient T = 1/(1 + (mg/(ℏ²k))²) is correct, but presenting it as "f(k)" may confuse readers expecting the Born-series normalization or 3D partial-wave conventions.

**More importantly:** the claim that d=1 "requires no renormalization" is **oversimplified**. While there is no UV divergence requiring counterterms, the delta potential V(x) = g δ(x) is still **not a well-defined operator perturbation** in the naive sense. The Hamiltonian H = −ℏ²/(2m) d²/dx² + g δ(x) requires self-adjoint extension theory: the boundary condition ψ'(0⁺) − ψ'(0⁻) = (2mg/ℏ²)ψ(0) must be imposed at the origin [Albeverio et al., §I.1]. This is a *boundary-condition datum*, not a "plain coupling constant." The distinction is that in d=1, this datum happens to be UV-finite (no cutoff dependence), whereas in d≥2 it becomes cutoff-dependent and requires renormalization.

**Verdict:** The d=1 case is better described as "UV-finite self-adjoint extension" rather than "no renormalization needed." The latter phrasing suggests the naive operator sum H₀ + g δ(x) makes sense, which is false.

**Claim 2 (d=2 logarithmic divergence / dimensional transmutation):** CORRECT

Verified against Example 5.1 in the fermionic-mediators paper:
- T(k)⁻¹ = 1/g₀ + (m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/k) ✓
- Beta function β(g_R) = (m/πℏ²)g_R² ✓
- Dynamical scale μ* = μ exp(πℏ²/(mg_R)) ✓

The "dimensional transmutation" interpretation is standard for this system: a dimensionless coupling generates a dimensionful scale via RG flow. No issues.

---

**Claim 3 (d=3 linear divergence):** CORRECT

Verified against Example 5.2:
- "linearly divergent loop integral" (exact phrasing in paper)
- Renormalization condition: 1/g₀ ∝ Λ + (finite part depending on a)
- Scattering amplitude f₀(k) = −a/(1+ika) ✓

The "linear" characterization (∝ Λ) is accurate. No issues.

---

**Claim 4 ("critical dimension d=2" and marginal coupling):** CORRECT

The engineering-dimension argument is sound:
- Contact coupling C₀ in d dimensions has mass dimension [C₀] = E·L^d.
- In natural units (ℏ=1), [C₀] = [Energy]^(1−d/2).
- At d=2, [C₀] = [Energy]⁰ = dimensionless → classically marginal.
- The loop integral ∫ d^d k/(k² − E) diverges logarithmically at d=2, confirming marginality.

The statement "quantum-mechanically relevant (asymptotic freedom of the inverse coupling)" is correct: β(g_R) = (m/πℏ²)g_R² > 0 for g_R > 0, so g_R flows to weak coupling at high energy (and the *inverse* coupling 1/g_R flows to zero, i.e., strong coupling in the IR). For attractive coupling (g_R < 0), the flow is toward the IR singularity. This is standard RG behavior for 2D contact interactions.

**Minor clarification:** "asymptotic freedom" typically refers to g→0 at high energy, which here applies to the *repulsive* case (g_R > 0). For attractive interactions (g_R < 0), the flow is opposite. The blackboard's phrasing is ambiguous; recommend specifying the sign of g_R when discussing flow direction.

---

**Claim 5 (structural lesson: d=1 well-posed, d≥2 requires renormalization):** CORRECT WITH CAVEATS

The qualitative progression is correct:
- d=1: UV-finite boundary-condition datum (one parameter, no cutoff dependence).
- d=2: running coupling + dynamical scale (two parameters: μ and g_R(μ)).
- d=3: scattering length (one parameter, but cutoff-dependent bare coupling).

However, the phrasing "d=1: the coupling IS the complete data (a number)" glosses over the self-adjoint extension requirement. A more precise statement: "d=1: the boundary-condition datum is UV-finite (no renormalization), but still requires extension theory." The delta function is not a function; it's a distributional shorthand for a singular boundary condition.

The contrast d=1 vs d≥2 should emphasize:
- d=1: *finite* boundary datum (no cutoff, but still needs operator definition via extensions).
- d≥2: *divergent* boundary datum (cutoff-dependent, requiring renormalization + physical matching).

### Overall assessment

**Summary:** The blackboard correctly identifies the dimensional dependence of contact-interaction divergences and the d=2 marginality. Examples 5.1 and 5.2 in the paper are accurately represented. However, the d=1 discussion oversimplifies by suggesting "no renormalization needed" implies the delta potential is a "well-defined operator perturbation" without caveats. In reality, even in d=1, the delta potential requires self-adjoint extension theory; the key distinction is that the extension parameter is *UV-finite*, not that extension theory is unnecessary.

**Recommended edits:**
1. Clarify in Claim 1: "d=1: UV-finite self-adjoint extension (no cutoff dependence, but boundary-condition datum still required)."
2. In Claim 5, replace "the coupling IS the complete data (a number)" with "the boundary-condition datum is a UV-finite number (no RG flow, but extension theory still applies)."
3. In Claim 4, specify the sign of g_R when discussing "asymptotic freedom" to avoid confusion.

**Bottom line:** The structural lesson is sound, but the d=1 phrasing should acknowledge that self-adjoint extensions are needed in *all* dimensions; the difference is whether the extension parameter is UV-finite (d=1) or cutoff-dependent (d≥2). This aligns better with the "boundary-condition reading" theme of Section 5 in the fermionic-mediators paper.
