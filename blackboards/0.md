# Cauchy Measurability Gap in d/2 Uniqueness Argument

Date: 2026-02-20
Task: #20 (self-directed)
Context: functional equation step in composition semigroup → d/2 exponent

---

## 1. The Gap Statement

The d/2 uniqueness argument uses:

**Step:** From K_{t₁} * K_{t₂} = K_{t₁+t₂} (semigroup) → ĥ(p;t₁)·ĥ(p;t₂) = ĥ(p;t₁+t₂) → F(p,t) := log ĥ(p;t) satisfies F(p,t₁+t₂) = F(p,t₁)+F(p,t₂) → F(p,t) = t·φ(p).

**The final step invokes the Cauchy functional equation theorem.** The standard statement:
"If f: ℝ → ℝ is additive [f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y) for ALL x,y] and measurable on a set of positive measure, then f(x) = cx."

**Gap:** The semigroup equation K_{t₁}*K_{t₂} = K_{t₁+t₂} holds for:
- ALL t₁,t₂ > 0? (Then Cauchy applies directly)
- ALMOST ALL (t₁,t₂)? (Then linearity is NOT immediate — needs separate argument)

## 2. Which Quantifier Holds?

### 2.1 L¹ semigroup: a.e. in x,y for each fixed (t₁,t₂)

If K ∈ L¹(ℝ^d, dy) for each fixed t, the composition integral ∫K(x,z;t₁)K(z,y;t₂)d^dz = K(x,y;t₁+t₂) holds pointwise a.e. in (x,y) for each FIXED (t₁,t₂).

Taking Fourier transform: ĥ(p;t₁)·ĥ(p;t₂) = ĥ(p;t₁+t₂) holds for a.e. p ∈ ℝ^d, for each fixed (t₁,t₂). This is the correct quantifier for the spatial variable.

### 2.2 For fixed p: does Cauchy hold for ALL or a.e. (t₁,t₂)?

For each fixed p where ĥ(p;t) is defined, consider F_p(t) = log ĥ(p;t) as a function of t alone.

**Case A: ĥ(p;·) is jointly measurable in (p,t).**
If ĥ(p;t) is Borel-measurable in (t₁,t₂) for a.e. p, then the semigroup equation holds for ALL t₁,t₂ in a dense (even full-measure) set.

**Key theorem (Fubini + a.e. additivity → a.e. linear):**
Suppose F: ℝ₊ → ℝ satisfies F(t₁+t₂) = F(t₁)+F(t₂) for a.e. (t₁,t₂) ∈ ℝ₊² (with respect to Lebesgue measure on ℝ₊²). Then F = linear a.e., i.e., ∃c such that F(t) = ct for a.e. t.

**Proof sketch:** Let E = {(t₁,t₂): F(t₁+t₂) ≠ F(t₁)+F(t₂)}, measure zero. The set of "bad" t₁ is {t₁: λ({t₂: (t₁,t₂) ∈ E}) > 0}, which has measure zero by Fubini. So for a.e. t₁, F(t₁+t₂) = F(t₁)+F(t₂) for a.e. t₂. Integrating: F(t₁)·λ(I) = ∫_I [F(t₁+t₂)-F(t₂)]dt₂ for any interval I. If F ∈ L¹_loc, this determines F(t₁) up to a.e. equivalence as a linear function.

**Conclusion for the d/2 argument:** If K(x,y;t) is jointly measurable in (x,y,t) and K ∈ L¹_loc in t (locally integrable in time, which is standard for propagators), then F_p(t) = ct a.e. in t. The Fourier argument goes through with "a.e." quantifiers throughout.

### 2.3 Does "a.e." suffice for the d/2 conclusion?

Yes, with one additional step: the kernel K(x,y;t) is characterized by its Fourier transform ĥ(p;t) a.e. in p. If ĥ(p;t) = exp(t·φ(p)) for a.e. (p,t), then K is determined a.e. as the inverse Fourier transform. For the normalization, the t^{-d/2} prefactor follows from φ(p) = c·p² (quadratic) and the inverse Fourier of exp(tc·p²) being t^{-d/2}-normalized.

**No continuity required.** The argument works under joint measurability + L¹_loc in t.

## 3. What Additional Regularity IS Needed

### 3.1 Joint measurability of (x,y,t) ↦ K(x,y;t)

This is a mild condition, automatically satisfied for kernels defined via classical action integrals (the action S_cl(x,y;t) is smooth in all variables) or via spectral theory (e^{-iHt} is jointly strongly measurable in t by Stone's theorem).

### 3.2 L¹_loc in t (locally integrable in time)

For the free Gaussian: K_0(x,y;t) ∝ t^{-d/2} exp(im|x-y|²/(2ℏt)). For fixed (x,y) with x≠y: |K_0| ∝ t^{-d/2}, which is in L¹_loc((0,∞)) for all d ≥ 1. For x = y: K_0(x,x;t) ∝ t^{-d/2} is in L¹_loc((0,∞)) iff d < 2. For d ≥ 2, the diagonal blows up non-integrably as t → 0. However, the Fourier transform ĥ(p;t) = exp(-iℏp²t/(2m)) is in L¹_loc in t for all p,d. So the Fourier-space version of the L¹_loc condition holds without restriction on d.

**The correct formulation:** Work in Fourier space. ĥ(p;·) ∈ L¹_loc((0,∞)) for each p, and the Cauchy equation holds for a.e. (t₁,t₂). This is the appropriate regularity class.

### 3.3 The non-measurable Cauchy solution: when it matters

The pathological Cauchy solutions (Hamel-basis constructions, additive functions that are nowhere measurable) CANNOT arise in the semigroup context because:
- They are not locally bounded on any interval
- They are not in L¹_loc
- Any kernel K arising from a physical composition semigroup is in L¹_loc in t (Fourier version)

Therefore the non-measurable solutions are automatically excluded without needing to assume them away.

---

## 4. Verdict

**The gap is real but bridgeable with minimal additional regularity:**

| Condition needed | Status |
|-----------------|--------|
| K jointly measurable in (x,y,t) | Automatic for action-based or Stone-generated kernels |
| ĥ(p;t) ∈ L¹_loc in t for a.e. p | Automatic from Fourier transform of physically reasonable K |
| Cauchy a.e. → linearity a.e. | Theorem (Fubini argument, see §2.2) |
| Linearity a.e. → d/2 exponent | Yes, for quadratic φ(p) = c·p² |

**Net conclusion:** The Cauchy step is valid under joint measurability + L¹_loc in t (Fourier space). These are not additional axioms — they follow from any kernel arising from either (a) classical action integrals or (b) Stone-generated unitary groups. The non-measurable Cauchy solutions are automatically excluded by local integrability.

**Implication for current manuscripts:** The notebooks (p42-hypothesis-reduction.md, path-integral-normalization paper Section 2.2) use "Cauchy + measurability → linear" without specifying which measurability condition. The correct statement is: joint measurability of K(x,y;t) + L¹_loc in t (Fourier space), both automatic. Should be noted as a brief remark, not a blocking gap.

## 5. Promotion Assessment

**Not blocking, but worth noting.** The current manuscripts are correct; the Cauchy step is valid as stated. However, precision demands noting:
1. The a.e. version of the Cauchy equation (from L¹ semigroup) suffices
2. L¹_loc in t (Fourier space) is the appropriate regularity, automatic from physical kernels
3. Non-measurable Cauchy solutions are excluded by local integrability, not by assumption

Could be a footnote or remark in notebooks/p42-hypothesis-reduction.md (append) or in the regularity remark RCP-R6.2 (already promoted — could add a sentence).
