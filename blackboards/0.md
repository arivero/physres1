# Berry-Tabor Conjecture and Spectral Statistics
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S137

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 7 (Outlook). Remark 7.1 discusses integrability breaking → eigenstate thermalization. This blackboard studies the spectral-statistics side of the same transition.

## Key Claims

### Berry-Tabor (1977)
For a generic integrable system with d degrees of freedom, the EBK quantization condition I_k = (n_k + α_k/4)ℏ turns the energy levels into values of a smooth function E(n_1,...,n_d) at lattice points. Berry and Tabor argued that generically (when the frequency ratios are incommensurable), the resulting energy levels behave statistically like a Poisson process — uncorrelated, with exponential nearest-neighbor spacing distribution P(s) = exp(-s).

The physical intuition: each torus is quantized independently; the energy is a smooth function of d independent integer quantum numbers; generically, these values land "randomly" on the energy axis because the level surfaces of E in integer space are not aligned with the lattice.

### Exception: harmonic degeneracies
When the classical frequencies are rationally related (e.g., the harmonic oscillator with ω_1 = ω_2, or hydrogen with its SO(4) degeneracy), levels cluster. The assumption "generic" in Berry-Tabor means frequencies incommensurable enough. The hydrogen atom is the canonical counterexample to naive Poisson statistics among integrable systems.

### Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS, 1984)
For classically chaotic systems (e.g., Sinai billiard, stadium billiard), the energy level statistics follow random matrix theory:
- GOE (Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) for time-reversal invariant systems: P(s) ≈ (π/2) s exp(-πs²/4) (Wigner surmise) — levels repel linearly.
- GUE (Gaussian Unitary Ensemble) when time-reversal is broken: P(s) ∝ s² exp(-4s²/π) — quadratic repulsion.

The key feature is **level repulsion**: in chaotic systems, nearby levels avoid each other. This is absent in Poisson statistics (integrable systems), where levels can be arbitrarily close.

### Physical content for the action-angle paper
The spectral statistics transition mirrors the phase-space structural transition of Remark 7.1:
- **Integrable**: action-angle tori organize phase space. EBK quantization on independent tori → Poisson-distributed levels. The Fourier tradeoff (Sections 3-6) governs each mode independently.
- **Chaotic**: tori are destroyed. No action-angle structure to organize the uncertainty. Level repulsion reflects the global entanglement of eigenstates across phase space — the eigenstate thermalization of Remark 7.1 has a spectral signature.

### The transition: KAM and mixed systems
For near-integrable systems (KAM regime), the level statistics interpolate between Poisson and GOE. The fraction of phase space covered by surviving tori decreases as the perturbation strength increases, and the level spacing distribution evolves accordingly. The Brody distribution P(s) ∝ s^β exp(-c s^{β+1}) with β ∈ [0,1] is commonly used to parametrize the transition (β=0: Poisson, β=1: GOE).

### Connection to the paper's message
This is the spectral counterpart of the spatial message in Sections 3-6: action-angle structure is not just about which variables are simultaneously sharp — it also organizes the spectrum. When that structure breaks, both the phase-space portrait (Remark 7.1) and the spectral statistics change qualitatively.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 7.2 after Remark 7.1. Content: Berry-Tabor predicts Poisson statistics for generic integrable systems (independent torus quantization); BGS predicts level repulsion (GOE/GUE) for chaotic systems; the spectral transition mirrors the phase-space structural transition of Remark 7.1.
