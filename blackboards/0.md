# Neutrino-Mediated Forces: The Fermionic Potential Question Answered
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S156

## Context
Target: fermionic mediators paper, Section 6 (Outlook) after Remark 6.1 (Cooper pairing), or possibly end of Section 3 after Remark 3.3.
The paper's central question is "can a fermionic field generate a potential?" The Grassmann obstruction (Section 3) says no direct classical-source analog exists. Vacuum polarization (Section 3.1) shows fermions affect forces through loops. But there is a direct calculation of neutrino-mediated forces between matter particles that provides the cleanest example.

## Key Claims

### Feinberg-Sucher neutrino-mediated force (1968)
Feinberg and Sucher computed the long-range force between two neutrons mediated by exchange of a neutrino-antineutrino pair (via weak interactions). The result:

  V(r) = G_F²/(4π³r⁵)

This is a 1/r⁵ potential — steeper than Coulomb (1/r) or Yukawa — arising from the exchange of two massless fermions (two-particle cut in the t-channel amplitude). The force is:
- Finite-range becomes infinite (power-law) when the fermion is massless
- Far weaker than electromagnetic or gravitational forces at macroscopic distances
- The leading long-range contribution from the weak interaction

### Why this is structurally important for the paper

1. **Direct fermionic force**: This is the closest one gets to "a fermionic field generating a potential." It is NOT a tree-level exchange (which would need Grassmann sources) but a box diagram with two fermion propagators — a loop effect, as predicted by Remark 3.1.

2. **Power-law scaling from fermion exchange**: The 1/r⁵ dependence (instead of exponential Yukawa suppression) reflects the fermion pair being massless — no mass gap to create exponential falloff. For massive neutrinos, the potential crosses over to exponential suppression at r >> 1/m_ν.

3. **Contact expansion at short distances**: At r << 1/M_W (above the weak scale), the two W propagators collapse to a point (Fermi four-fermion vertex), and the calculation reduces to a contact-interaction version of the force — connecting to Section 4's contact expansion.

4. **Comparison with bosonic exchange**: A single boson exchange gives 1/r (Coulomb) or e^{-mr}/r (Yukawa). The 1/r⁵ law for two-fermion exchange reflects the higher power of the propagator (two fermion lines vs. one boson line), times phase space for the pair.

### The retardation connection
The 1/r⁵ law is also reminiscent of the Casimir-Polder (retarded van der Waals) force, which goes as 1/r⁷. In both cases, the force is mediated by virtual particles (photons for Casimir-Polder, neutrinos for Feinberg-Sucher), and the power law is set by the number of virtual propagators and the dimensionality of the coupling.

## Proposed Remark
Remark 6.2 in fermionic Section 6, after Remark 6.1 (Cooper pairing). Or possibly a new section.
Content: Feinberg-Sucher neutrino-mediated force V(r) ~ G_F²/r⁵ as the direct answer to the paper's motivating question. Not a tree-level exchange but a two-fermion-pair loop, consistent with the Grassmann obstruction. Power-law (not Yukawa) because the neutrino is (nearly) massless. At short distances, collapses to the contact expansion of Section 4.
