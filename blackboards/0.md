# Coherent-State Path Integral
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S164

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 7 (outlook, after Remark 7.5 on geometric quantization).
The paper discusses coherent states extensively (Example 6.1, Remarks 6.4-6.9) and path
integrals via the uncuttable companion. The coherent-state path integral bridges these:
it expresses quantum evolution directly in phase-space coordinates using coherent-state
resolutions of the identity.

## Key Claims

### Coherent-state path integral (Klauder 1960, Glauber 1963)
The resolution of identity 1 = (1/π) ∫ |α⟩⟨α| d²α allows writing the propagator as:
K = ∫ D²α exp(i S_cs[α]/ℏ)
where S_cs = ∫ dt [iℏ α̇* α - H(α*,α)] is the coherent-state action.

The first term iℏ α̇* α is the symplectic 1-form p dq written in complex coordinates
(α = (q+ip)/√(2ℏ)), giving the Berry phase (Remark 3.5 of uncuttable) as the kinetic
term in the action.

### Connection to the paper's themes
1. Coherent states (Example 6.1) are the basis for this path integral
2. The action-angle structure appears directly: for |α| = √n, the phase θ parametrizes
   the angle variable, and the action integral around a torus gives the EBK condition
3. The Bargmann representation (Remark 6.9) is the "wave function" version of this
   path integral: holomorphic functions ↔ phase-space amplitudes
4. Spin coherent states (Remark 6.8) give a path integral on S² with a Wess-Zumino
   term encoding the spin quantum number

### Stationary phase → classical orbits
The semiclassical limit ℏ→0 of the coherent-state path integral recovers Hamilton's
equations in complex form: iα̇ = ∂H/∂α*, which are exactly the classical equations
on the phase plane. The fluctuations around stationary phase give the semiclassical
corrections connecting to the Gutzwiller formula (Remark 7.4).

## Proposed Remark
Remark 7.6 in action-angle paper.
