# Blackboard 0 — Dipole selection rules as Fourier orthogonality (Section 3, action-angle)

## Target
Remark 3.2 in action-angle paper, after Remark 3.1 (real spherical harmonics),
before Section 4.

## Core content

The azimuthal Fourier structure e^{im phi} of Section 3 has its most
experimentally consequential manifestation in electromagnetic selection rules.

The dipole transition matrix element for electric dipole radiation involves:
  <n'l'm'| r Y_1^q |nlm>

where q = 0 for π-transitions (z-polarization) and q = ±1 for σ-transitions
(circular polarization). The azimuthal integral is:

  ∫_0^{2π} e^{-im'φ} e^{iqφ} e^{imφ} dφ = 2π δ_{m', m+q}

which gives the selection rule Δm = q = 0, ±1 directly from Fourier
orthogonality on the circle.

Physical interpretation:
- Each emitted photon carries angular momentum ℏ along the quantization axis
  (σ+ for Δm=+1, σ- for Δm=-1, π for Δm=0)
- The selection rule is the conservation of angular momentum projected onto
  the z-axis: the photon angular momentum plus the change in atomic m equals zero
- The azimuthal uniformity of |m⟩ eigenstates (Section 3) thus directly
  constrains which transitions are allowed: only those that maintain the
  Fourier structure of the azimuthal wavefunction.

Connection to the paper's theme:
- The selection rules are the observational face of the Fourier tradeoff
  of Section 4: the orthogonality of Fourier modes constrains which modes
  can couple, and this orthogonality is precisely the mathematical content
  of the uniform phi distribution.
- The Zeeman effect provides the canonical experimental demonstration:
  in a magnetic field, the m-degeneracy is lifted, and the spectral
  lines split into components with Δm = 0, ±1 — directly encoding
  the azimuthal Fourier structure in the emitted light.
