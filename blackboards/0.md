# Blackboard 0 — Orbital angular momentum of light (Section 3, action-angle)

## Target
Remark 3.3 in action-angle paper, after Remark 3.2 (dipole selection rules),
before Section 4.

## Core content

The azimuthal structure e^{imφ} of Section 3 is not limited to matter
wavefunctions: optical beams carry orbital angular momentum (OAM) with
the same e^{iℓφ} dependence. Allen, Beijersbergen, Spreeuw, and Woerdman
(1992) showed that Laguerre-Gauss beams LG_{p,ℓ} carry OAM of ℓℏ per
photon, independent of the spin angular momentum (polarization).

Key physics:
- LG modes have azimuthal phase e^{iℓφ}, exactly the Section 3 structure
- An LG mode with definite ℓ has an azimuthal intensity that is uniform
  in φ (the ring-shaped "doughnut" beam) — the optical version of the
  L_z eigenstate's uniform φ distribution
- Superposing ℓ and -ℓ creates "petal" patterns with cos²(ℓφ) intensity
  — the photonic analog of real spherical harmonics (Remark 3.1)
- The OAM alphabet {ℓ = 0, ±1, ±2, ...} is unbounded, unlike spin
  polarization (2D) — enabling higher-dimensional quantum key distribution
  (Mair et al., 2001)

Connection to the paper:
- The azimuthal Fourier tradeoff (Section 4) applies identically to
  photonic OAM: localizing the angular position of a photon requires
  superposing many ℓ modes
- The selection rule ΔL_z = ℓ_photon is a photonic extension of Remark 3.2's
  dipole selection rule
- The OAM singularity (phase vortex at the beam axis) is topological:
  the phase winds by 2πℓ around the axis, forcing zero intensity there
  — a topological feature absent from any single plane wave
