# Cooper Pairing: Fermion Bilinears as Emergent Bosonic Mediators
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S151

## Context
Target: fermionic mediators paper, Section 6 (Outlook). The paper's arc: fermions can't directly source classical potentials (Section 3 obstruction), but at low energy the relevant physics is captured by contact/boundary-condition data (Sections 4-5). The outlook mentions "emergent bosonic composite modes" but gives no example. Cooper pairing is the canonical case: fermion pairs form a bosonic condensate that mediates the Meissner effect (expulsion of magnetic fields) — an emergent long-range phenomenon from fundamentally fermionic physics.

## Key Claims

### Cooper instability
In a degenerate Fermi gas, any attractive interaction (however weak) between fermions near the Fermi surface leads to a bound state of two fermions — a Cooper pair (Cooper, 1956). The binding energy is non-perturbative:

  Δ ∝ ω_D exp(-1/(N(0)|V|))

where N(0) is the density of states at the Fermi surface, |V| is the (attractive) interaction strength, and ω_D is the Debye cutoff. The exponential dependence means the effect cannot be seen at any finite order of perturbation theory.

### The emergent boson
The Cooper pair is a composite object with:
- Spin 0 (singlet pairing) or spin 1 (triplet) — bosonic statistics
- Charge 2e
- Center-of-mass momentum ~0 (BCS ground state pairs time-reversed states k↑ and -k↓)

At temperatures below T_c, these pairs form a condensate described by a complex order parameter Δ(x) = ⟨ψ↓ψ↑⟩. This condensate is a bosonic field that arises entirely from fermionic degrees of freedom.

### The emergent interaction: Meissner effect
The condensate gives mass to the photon via the Anderson-Higgs mechanism:

  L_eff ∝ |Δ|² A_μ A^μ

This generates an effective photon mass m_A ∝ |Δ|/v_F, leading to the Meissner effect: magnetic fields decay exponentially inside the superconductor with penetration depth λ = 1/m_A. This is an emergent long-range (or rather, length-scale-setting) effect mediated by a bosonic composite of fermions — precisely the kind of "emergent bosonic composite mode" that Section 6 mentions.

### Connection to the paper's themes

1. **Resolution of the fermionic obstruction**: The fermion bilinear ψψ is a bosonic operator. When it condenses, it can source a classical field (the order parameter Δ) that enters the effective Lagrangian as a standard bosonic field. The Grassmann-source obstruction of Section 3 is bypassed by going to the composite (bilinear) level.

2. **Connection to BEC-BCS crossover**: In the BEC limit of Remark 5.6 (Feshbach resonances), the Cooper pairs shrink to tightly bound molecules — actual bosons — and the crossover from BCS (overlapping pairs) to BEC (point bosons) is continuous. The "emergent boson" interpolates between a many-body collective mode and a genuine two-body bound state.

3. **Contact interaction → gap equation**: The BCS gap equation in the contact-interaction limit (V(r) = g₀δ(r)) requires the same renormalization as Examples 5.1-5.2: the bare coupling g₀ diverges as the cutoff is removed, and the physical gap Δ is determined by the renormalized coupling (scattering length a).

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 6.1, replacing/expanding the current thin Section 6 text.

Content: Cooper pairing as the canonical resolution of the fermionic obstruction — fermion bilinears form bosonic condensates that can source classical fields. The BCS gap is non-perturbative (∝ exp(-1/(N(0)|V|))). The condensate gives mass to gauge fields (Anderson-Higgs/Meissner effect). In the contact-interaction limit, the BCS gap equation requires the same renormalization as Examples 5.1-5.2, and the BEC-BCS crossover of Remark 5.6 interpolates between collective Cooper pairs and genuine bosonic molecules.
