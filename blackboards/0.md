# Feshbach Resonances: Tunable Contact Interactions from Closed Channels
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S145

## Context
Target: fermionic mediators paper, Section 5 (after Remark 5.5 on Efimov, before Section 6). The paper discusses contact interactions with RG-running couplings (Examples 5.1-5.2) and the unitarity limit (Remark 5.3). Feshbach resonances provide the laboratory mechanism for tuning a through ±∞, realizing the entire RG flow experimentally.

## Key Claims

### Mechanism
A magnetic Feshbach resonance occurs when a bound state in a closed scattering channel (magnetically shifted) becomes nearly degenerate with the threshold of the open channel. The coupling between channels produces a resonance in the s-wave scattering amplitude, with the scattering length given by:

  a(B) = a_bg (1 - ΔB / (B - B_0))

where a_bg is the background scattering length, B_0 is the resonance position, and ΔB is the resonance width. As B → B_0, a → ±∞: the system passes through the unitarity limit of Remark 5.3.

### Connection to the paper's themes
1. **Tunable contact coupling**: The magnetic field B provides an external knob that tunes the effective contact interaction continuously. This is the experimental realization of the RG flow in Examples 5.1-5.2: varying B is equivalent to varying the renormalized coupling at a fixed scale.

2. **Crossing the fixed point**: As B sweeps through B_0, the scattering length diverges (a → ±∞), passes through the unitarity fixed point (Remark 5.3), and emerges on the other side with opposite sign. This traversal of the RG fixed point is observable as the BEC-BCS crossover in cold Fermi gases.

3. **Microscopic origin is fermionic**: In alkali-atom experiments, the Feshbach resonance arises from hyperfine coupling between electronic and nuclear spin states — an intrinsically fermionic (spin-½) degree of freedom. The effective bosonic interaction (contact potential between atoms) emerges from the fermion-mediated coupling, exactly in the spirit of Section 3: fermions affect forces through loop/coupling mechanisms, not through tree-level source elimination.

4. **Self-adjoint extension parametrization**: The formula a(B) shows that the one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions (parametrized by the scattering length a) is physically realized as a one-parameter family of magnetic field values. Different B select different SAEs — and the singular extension at B = B_0 (a = ±∞) is the scale-invariant fixed point.

### Experimental milestones
- Inouye et al. (1998): first observation of Feshbach resonance in sodium BEC.
- Regal, Greiner, Jin (2004): BEC-BCS crossover in potassium-40 Fermi gas.
- Kraemer et al. (2006): Efimov states near Feshbach resonance in cesium (connects to Remark 5.5).

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 5.6, after Remark 5.5 (Efimov), before Section 6.

Content: Feshbach resonances as the laboratory realization of the contact-coupling RG flow. Magnetic field tunes a through ±∞, sweeping through the unitarity fixed point. The BEC-BCS crossover demonstrates the full RG trajectory experimentally. The microscopic mechanism involves fermion spin degrees of freedom — a concrete instance of "fermions affect forces through coupling mechanisms" (Section 3).
