# Deformation Quantization: Star Product as ℏ-Refinement
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S160

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 3 (Dynamics), after Remark 3.6 (WKB) and before Section 4.
The paper's Section 3 discusses dynamics (action, path integral, Trotter formula). Deformation quantization offers a complementary view: the quantum theory is obtained by "deforming" the classical algebra of observables with a parameter ℏ, via the star product (Moyal product). This is refinement in ℏ rather than in mesh size.

## Key Claims

### The Moyal star product (1949)
Given two classical observables f(q,p) and g(q,p) on phase space, their quantum product is encoded by the Moyal star product:

  (f ★ g)(q,p) = f·g + (iℏ/2){f,g} + O(ℏ²)

where {f,g} is the Poisson bracket. The full expression is:

  f ★ g = f · exp(iℏ/2 (←∂_q →∂_p - ←∂_p →∂_q)) · g

The key properties:
- At ℏ=0: f ★ g = f·g (classical, commutative)
- To O(ℏ): [f,g]_★ := f★g - g★f = iℏ{f,g} + O(ℏ³) (quantum commutator recovers Poisson bracket)
- The star product is associative but noncommutative

### Kontsevich formality theorem (2003 Fields Medal)
Kontsevich proved (1997, published 2003) that every Poisson manifold admits a star product — deformation quantization exists in full generality. Moreover, the space of star products is classified by formal deformations of the Poisson structure, and equivalent star products are related by gauge transformations.

### Connection to "uncuttable" theme

1. **ℏ-refinement**: The star product is a formal power series in ℏ. Each order adds a higher-derivative correction to the pointwise product — the "counterterm tower" of Section 2, now indexed by powers of ℏ rather than mesh refinement order.

2. **Non-uniqueness of ordering**: Different operator orderings (Weyl, normal, anti-normal) correspond to different star products — all equivalent up to gauge transformation. This is the deformation-quantization counterpart of the α-ordering non-uniqueness of Example 3.1.

3. **Moyal bracket as quantum correction to Poisson**: The commutator f★g - g★f = iℏ{f,g} + (iℏ)³/24 (∂³f/∂q³ ∂³g/∂p³ + ...) shows quantum mechanics as a systematic deformation of classical mechanics — the hallmark of "controlled refinement."

### Wigner-Weyl correspondence
The star product is the phase-space counterpart of operator multiplication via the Wigner-Weyl correspondence: if Â = W(f) and B̂ = W(g) are the Weyl-quantized operators, then ÂB̂ = W(f★g). The Wigner function of Remark 6.6 (action-angle paper) is the phase-space representative of the density operator via this map.

## Proposed Remark
Remark 3.7 in uncuttable Section 3, after Remark 3.6 (WKB), before Section 4.
Content: Moyal star product as ℏ-deformation of the classical product. Recovers Poisson bracket at O(ℏ), with systematic higher-order corrections. Different orderings → different star products (gauge equivalence = deformation version of Example 3.1's ordering non-uniqueness). Kontsevich proved existence for all Poisson manifolds.
