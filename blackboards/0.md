# Blackboard 0 — Schwinger model (Section 3, fermionic mediators)

## Target
Remark 3.7 in fermionic paper, after Remark 3.6 (optical theorem),
before Section 4.

## Core content

The Schwinger model (QED in 1+1 dimensions: massless fermions coupled
to a U(1) gauge field) is exactly solvable and provides the simplest
demonstration of how fermionic fields produce a bosonic physical spectrum.

Key physics:
- The model confines: the "photon" acquires a mass m = e/√π (where e
  is the gauge coupling), and the physical spectrum consists of a single
  massive boson — the "Schwinger boson," a fermion-antifermion bound state
- There are no free fermions in the spectrum: the Grassmann-source
  obstruction of Section 3 is realized in its most extreme form —
  fermions are permanently confined into bosonic composites
- The exact fermion propagator shows complete cancellation of the
  fermion pole by gauge interactions — the fermion is "screened out"
  of the physical spectrum
- The chiral anomaly plays a central role: the axial current
  ∂_μ j^{μ5} = (e/π) ε^{μν} F_{μν} converts the would-be chiral
  symmetry into the mass of the Schwinger boson. The boson mass is
  entirely anomaly-generated
- The θ-vacuum structure: the model has a θ-parameter (topological
  vacuum angle) that produces a background electric field E = eθ/(2π),
  giving a non-zero energy density — the 1+1D analog of the QCD
  vacuum structure

Connection to the paper:
- Demonstrates the full fermion → boson chain of Section 6 in an
  exactly solvable setting
- The Schwinger boson mass m = e/√π arises from a fermion loop (the
  vacuum polarization of Section 3.1), but the exact answer resums
  all orders — going beyond the perturbative story
- At distances r >> 1/m, the interaction is exponentially screened
  (Yukawa-like), collapsing to the contact expansion of Section 4
- The model provides the simplest example of confinement (Remark 6.4)
  and dimensional transmutation (Example 5.1)
