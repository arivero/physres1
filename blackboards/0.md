## 1. Setup

Half-density scalarization (PA-H2.2 + PA-H2.3) demands a reference
half-density sigma_* carrying dimension length^{d/2}. Under the monomial
sieve (PA-H2.5a), this must be built as prod g_i^{n_i} with integer n_i
from "admitted couplings" whose length dimensions are integers (PA-H2.7a).

**Parity lemma.** If all admitted couplings have integer length dimensions
a_i in Z, then any monomial sum(n_i a_i) with n_i in Z is an integer.
Hence a half-integer target d/2 (odd d) is unreachable. QED.

This is categorical: adding more integer-dimensional couplings (Lambda_d,
extra scalars, etc.) cannot overcome the parity obstruction for odd d.

## 2. Coupling Dimension Table

Standard couplings and their length dimensions ([.] = length^a):

| Coupling             | [.] = length^a      | a for d=1 | d=2 | d=3 | d=4 | d=5 |
|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| G_d (gravity)        | length^{d-2}         |    -1     |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |
| Lambda_d (cosmo)     | length^{-2}          |    -2     | -2  | -2  | -2  | -2  |
| g_d^2 (YM action)    | length^{d-4}         |    -3     | -2  | -1  |  0  |  1  |
| m (mass, c=hbar=1)   | length^{-1}          |    -1     | -1  | -1  | -1  | -1  |
| alpha_* (area param)  | length^2             |     2     |  2  |  2  |  2  |  2  |

All entries are integers. The parity lemma applies.

Note: The unsquared YM coupling g_d has [g_d] = length^{(d-4)/2}, which
is half-integer for odd d. But g_d is NOT an admitted coupling under
PA-H2.7a (the action contains 1/(4 g_d^2), so the admitted parameter is
g_d^2). Using g_d directly would mean taking a square root of g_d^2,
violating PA-H2.5a.

## 3. Scale-Supplier Table (Main Deliverable)

| d | d/2   | Parity | Monomial sieve (PA-H2.5a) | Transmutation (PA-H2.13)         | Witness                       |
|---|-------|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | 1/2   | half   | BLOCKED (parity)          | Available if marginal coupling   | QM on R: no standard marginal |

### d = 1: quantum mechanics on the line

Required scale: length^{1/2}. Parity-blocked under monomial sieve.
Standard 1D QM has dimensionful couplings (m, hbar) but both have
integer length dimensions. The 1D delta potential is exactly solvable
without renormalization (Remark 4.2 of delta-objects note), so no
transmutation occurs. Scale supplier: needs external input or fractional
powers.

### d = 2: the marginal/transmutation dimension

Required scale: length^1. Integer, so the parity obstruction is absent.
But G_2 is dimensionless, so gravity provides no scale under monomial
sieve. Transmutation witness: the 2D delta interaction generates
kappa_* (dimension length^{-1}) via beta ~ g_R^2 (PA-E5). The
scalarization constant is kappa_*^{-1} = length^1 = length^{d/2}. This
is the canonical transmutation witness.

### d = 3: parity-blocked, but transmutation via scattering length

Required scale: length^{3/2}. Half-integer: parity-blocked.
Under transmutation: the 3D delta interaction generates a scattering
length a (dimension length^1) via power-law renormalization (Remark 4.2,
Jackiw). The scalarization constant a^{3/2} = length^{3/2} = length^{d/2}.
This is well-defined (a > 0), but involves a half-integer power of the
transmutation scale itself.

Key subtlety: is a^{3/2} "non-analytic"? The transmutation scale a is
already non-analytic in the bare coupling (it requires renormalization).
Taking a^{3/2} adds no qualitatively new non-analyticity -- it is the
composition of a positive real number with the function x -> x^{3/2},
which is smooth on (0, infinity). The "fractional power" concern of
PA-H2.5 applies to couplings, not to derived physical scales.

### d = 4: the unique monomial-sieve pass

Required scale: length^2. [G_4] = length^2 = length^{d/2}. The monomial
k = 1 works. This is the content of Derivation PA-D1.3. Transmutation
also works: Lambda_QCD^{-2} has dimension length^2 in d=4 QCD.

### d = 5: parity-blocked, transmutation limited

Required scale: length^{5/2}. Half-integer: parity-blocked.
YM in d=5 has [g_5^2] = length^1 (super-renormalizable, not AF), so
standard transmutation does not apply (no RG-invariant scale from
perturbative running). Gravity [G_5] = length^3 (integer), but
G_5^{5/6} is needed -- fractional power. Scale supplier requires either
fractional coupling powers, a non-perturbative UV completion, or an
extra area parameter alpha_* (but alpha_*^{5/4} is again fractional).

## 4. The Transmutation Route Is Parity-Blind

Claim: If a transmutation scale Lambda_* exists (dimension length^{-1}),
then Lambda_*^{-d/2} has dimension length^{d/2} for any d, integer or not.

Proof: Lambda_* is a positive real number with dimension length^{-1}.
The function x -> x^{d/2} is smooth on (0, infinity) for all real d/2.
Therefore Lambda_*^{-d/2} is well-defined and carries the correct
dimension. No "fractional power of a coupling" is involved because
Lambda_* is not a coupling -- it is a derived RG-invariant scale.

The parity obstruction is specific to the monomial sieve (PA-H2.5a),
where integer-exponent monomials in integer-dimensional couplings can
only reach integer length dimensions.

## 5. The d = 3 Witness (Explicit)

The 3D delta interaction provides the cleanest odd-d witness.

Model: H_0 = -hbar^2/(2m) nabla^2 on R^3, with point interaction at
origin. The self-adjoint extension is parametrized by the scattering
length a (dimension length^1) via power-law renormalization (Jackiw,
Derezinski). The bound state (for a > 0) has E = -hbar^2/(2m a^2).

Scalarization: The identity kernel on R^3 in the half-density language
has the scaling K_Id ~ epsilon^{-3/2} delta(v) |dx|^{1/2} |dv|^{1/2}
(near-diagonal, Section 2 of delta-objects). A scalar representative
requires sigma_* ~ L_*^{-3/2} |dx|^{1/2}. The scattering length
provides L_* = a, giving sigma_* ~ a^{-3/2} |dx|^{1/2}.

This is the odd-d transmutation witness: the scalarization scale
a^{3/2} = length^{3/2} = length^{d/2} is supplied by the RG-invariant
contact datum (scattering length), requiring no fractional powers of
fundamental couplings.

## 6. Conclusion

The monomial sieve (PA-H2.5a) is an even-d filter. In odd d, the
parity obstruction is categorical: no set of integer-dimensional
couplings can produce a half-integer monomial. The transmutation branch
(PA-H2.13) is parity-blind and equally available in all d where a
marginal or relevant coupling generates a physical scale via
renormalization. The d=3 delta interaction provides an explicit odd-d
witness where the transmutation-derived scattering length supplies the
needed length^{3/2} scalarization constant.

For the Planck-area note: the claim "d=4 is selected by the monomial
sieve" remains valid and should be stated precisely as: "among even d
with gravity-only coupling, d=4 is uniquely selected." Odd d is blocked
by parity, not by the gravity coupling's specific dimension. This
distinction matters because it shows the sieve's selectivity depends on
two separate hypotheses: integrality (PA-H2.5a) AND integer parity of
d/2 (which is a consequence of d being even).
