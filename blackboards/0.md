# Physicist Audit: Sections 1-2

## Severity scale
- sev-1: blocking (wrong physics, broken logic)
- sev-2: important (misleading, missing caveat)
- sev-3: minor (cosmetic, style, pedantic)

---

## A. Dimensional Analysis

### A1. Action S[q] (line 55)
- [S] = [L][T] = ML^2T^{-1}. Correct.

### A2. Discrete action S_N (line 61)
- Argument of L: (q_k, (q_{k+1}-q_k)/Delta_t, t_k) * Delta_t.
- [L]*[T] = [S]. Consistent with A1.

### A3. Areal velocity (line 67)
- [A_dot] = [r^2][theta_dot] = L^2 T^{-1}. Correct (area/time).
- [L_ang] = [m][r^2][theta_dot] = ML^2T^{-1} = [S]. Correct.
- L_ang = 2m A_dot. Factor of 2 correct.

### A4. D0.1 exponential weight (line 97)
- W = exp(c_0 S/kappa). [c_0 S/kappa] must be dimensionless.
- [kappa] = [S] = [action]. Correct.
- c_0 = i: dimensionless. Correct.

### A5. D0.2 relativistic action (line 107)
- S_rel = -mc^2 int dt sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).
- [mc^2][T] = ML^2T^{-2} * T = ML^2T^{-1} = [action]. Correct.
- Sign: minus in front. Standard Minkowski convention. Correct.

### A6. D0.2 expansion (line 112)
- -mc^2 + (1/2)m v^2 + O(c^{-2}).
- Check: sqrt(1-x) ~ 1 - x/2 - x^2/8 - ...
  so -mc^2(1 - v^2/(2c^2) - ...) = -mc^2 + (1/2)mv^2 + O(v^4/c^2).
- The O(c^{-2}) claim: next term is (m/8)(v^4/c^2), which is O(c^{-2}). Correct.
- Phase factor e^{-imc^2 T/hbar}: sign is MINUS (line 116). Check: subtracting -mc^2 T
  from action gives S_NR, so exp(iS_rel/hbar) = exp(-imc^2 T/hbar) * exp(iS_NR/hbar).
  The minus sign in the exponent is correct.

**VERDICT: All dimensional analysis CLEAN. No sev-1/sev-2.**

---

## B. Limiting Cases

### B1. hbar -> 0 in H0.3 (line 29)
- "Recovers classical stationarity from oscillatory composition." Correct (stationary phase).

### B2. c -> infinity in D0.2 (lines 103-117)
- NR kinetic action recovered after rest-energy subtraction. Correct.
- Caveat about vacuum energy at field-theory level: present (line 117). Good.

### B3. G -> 0 in H0.3 (line 29)
- "Switches off geometric backreaction." Correct (flat spacetime limit).

### B4. D0.1 kappa -> 0 (line 97)
- W -> exp(c_0 S * infinity) — wildly oscillatory or exponentially divergent.
  Consistent with P4.2 claim that kappa -> 0 collapses composition.

**VERDICT: Limiting cases CLEAN.**

---

## C. Sign Conventions

### C1. Relativistic action sign
- S_rel = -mc^2 int sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) dt. Minus sign: standard (Landau-Lifshitz convention).
  Some authors use +mc^2 with Euclidean signature. Current convention is self-consistent
  and matches the expansion to +1/2 m v^2. CLEAN.

### C2. Phase convention
- exp(iS/hbar) is the Feynman convention (Lorentzian signature).
  D0.1 sets c_0 = i for this. Consistent throughout.

**VERDICT: Signs CLEAN.**

---

## D. Physical Plausibility of Claims

### D1. Footnote in line 14: "Locality of L from action additivity"
- Claim: S[gamma_if] = S[gamma_im] + S[gamma_mf] for generic paths implies no
  cross-temporal correlations, hence L local.
- **Assessment**: This is physically correct as stated. Non-local-in-time Lagrangians
  (e.g. L(q(t), q(t')) with t != t') would generically violate temporal additivity.
  The Ostrogradsky caveat (restricting to first derivatives) is correctly noted.
- Labeled as Stage 1 forcing (weaker than P4.2). Fair characterization. CLEAN.

### D2. H0.2 item 2: ordering ambiguity witness (line 21)
- "H=pq can yield -pq_hat vs -qp_hat differing by O(hbar)."
- Check: [p_hat, q_hat] = -ihbar, so p_hat q_hat - q_hat p_hat = -ihbar.
  Thus -p_hat q_hat = -q_hat p_hat + ihbar. The O(hbar) difference is correct.
- Forward ref to D4.1c (line 685): exists. CLEAN.

### D3. H0.2 item 3: derivative as 1/epsilon subtraction (line 22)
- "The derivative exists only after subtracting a 1/epsilon divergence..."
- **sev-3 quibble**: The standard difference quotient (f(x+eps)-f(x))/eps does NOT
  require a 1/epsilon subtraction; it converges as eps->0 for differentiable f.
  The claim is metaphorical (treating the 1/eps pole structure as analogous to
  renormalization subtraction). This is labeled "toy witness," which is appropriate
  framing. Not technically wrong as a heuristic analogy, but a pedantic reader
  might object. No fix needed since it's in a Heuristic.

### D4. H0.2a: no Lebesgue measure on path space (line 26)
- Claim correct. Standard result (see Velhinho2017). Citation present. CLEAN.

### D5. P0.1: action additivity (line 88)
- "S_N additive over concatenated subintervals by construction."
- True by definition of the sum. Tautological but correctly labeled as a
  starting point. CLEAN.

### D6. D0.1: composition-compatible exponential (lines 90-98)
- The three conditions (multiplicative composition, log-locality, proportionality to S)
  do force exponential form. This is essentially the statement that the unique
  continuous homomorphism from (R, +) to (R_{>0}, *) is exp.
- "Up to normalization" caveat is present. CLEAN.

### D7. H0.1: stationary phase concentration (line 101)
- "When phase scale is small relative to action variation..."
- More precisely: when S/hbar >> 1, the rapid oscillation cancels non-stationary
  contributions. Standard. CLEAN.

### D8. Contributions list (lines 39-45)
- 6 items claimed. Cross-check with later sections:
  1. Refinement/composition chain: §§3-4-6. Present.
  2. Half-density composition: §6. Present (confirmed in prior audits).
  3. t^{-d/2} from composition: D4.1a. Present.
  4. P4.2 necessity theorem: §6 line 611. Present.
  5. RG as refinement compatibility: §8. Present.
  6. 2D delta computation: Appendix 10.5. Present.
- All 6 contributions are substantiated in the paper. CLEAN.

**VERDICT: No sev-1. One sev-3 quibble (D3). Overall CLEAN.**

---

## E. Cross-Reference Consistency

### E1. "Uncuttable" companion note (line 12)
- Status: DISCARD pending (2/3 votes). If discarded, this reference becomes a
  dangling pointer. **sev-2**: after DISCARD, line 12 needs revision (remove
  companion note reference or reword as "the distinction between...").

### E2. Forward refs from §1
- D4.1c (line 21 -> line 685): EXISTS.
- P4.2 (lines 14, 43 -> line 611): EXISTS.
- D0.2 (line 30 -> line 103): EXISTS (same section). CLEAN.

### E3. Reader map (lines 125-130)
- C_t -> Sections 3-4: correct (composition, action).
- Q_hbar -> Sections 6-7: correct (ordering, deformation quantization).
- R_Lambda -> Section 8 + Appendix 10.5: correct (RG, 2D delta).
- Appendix 10.3 reference: exists (line 1609). CLEAN.

### E4. Section 2 transition to Section 3 (line 132-133)
- "Derives the Newtonian area-law refinement argument..."
- Section 3 does this (line 135ff). Consistent.

### E5. Dimension convention d vs D (line 49)
- d = composition-variable dimension (config space), D = spacetime dimension.
- Check: §§1-2 only use d (correct, no field theory in intro). Later sections
  that switch to D should also be checked (but out of scope for this audit).

### E6. Bibliography refs in §§1-2
- [Newton1687]: line 12. Present in bibliography. CLEAN.
- [Dirac1933]: line 14. Present. CLEAN.
- [Feynman1948]: line 14. Present. CLEAN.
- [Berkeley1734Analyst]: line 16. Present. CLEAN.
- [Velhinho2017InfDimMeasure]: line 26. Present. CLEAN.
- [Landsman1998]: line 33. Present but PENDING_LIBRARY. **sev-3**: cite is valid
  but source not fully acquired. Already tracked in research-state.md.
- [Connes1994]: line 33. Present. CLEAN.
- [ConnesKreimer2000]: line 34. Present. CLEAN.

**VERDICT: One sev-2 (E1: uncuttable dangling ref after DISCARD). Rest CLEAN.**

## F. Logical Flow and Completeness

### F1. Three-anchor structure
- Anchor 1 (Newton): line 12. Present.
- Anchor 2 (action): line 14. Present.
- Anchor 3 (methodology): line 32. Present.
- Clean parallel structure. Good.

### F2. §2 as notation section
- Core objects (2.1): action, discrete action, areal velocity. Complete for §§3-4.
- Weak-form preliminaries (2.2): mollifier convention. Complete for §5.
- Claim taxonomy (2.3): three types. Complete.
- Seed claims (2.4): P0.1, D0.1, H0.1, D0.2. Good seeding.
- Scope boundary (2.5): explicit methodological guard. Good.

### F3. Missing: no mention of Proposition numbering restart
- §1 introduces H0.2, H0.2a, H0.3. §2 introduces P0.1, D0.1, H0.1, D0.2.
- Numbering uses prefix H0/P0/D0 for "seed" claims. Later sections use
  section-based prefixes (P4.2, D4.1a, etc.). This convention is implicit,
  not explicitly stated in the taxonomy. **sev-3**: could add one sentence
  to §2.3 clarifying the numbering scheme.

## Summary

| Sev | Count | Items |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 1   | 0     | (none) |
| 2   | 1     | E1: uncuttable companion note dangling ref after DISCARD |
| 3   | 2     | D3: derivative-as-subtraction metaphor; F3: claim numbering convention implicit |

**Overall: CLEAN. No blocking issues. One important conditional item (E1).**

The sev-2 item (E1) is conditional on the uncuttable paper being discarded. If DISCARD
is executed, line 12 of §1 must be revised to remove the companion note reference.
This is a maintenance item, not a physics error.

§§1-2 are well-structured, dimensionally consistent, physically sound, and properly
cross-referenced. Ready for submission alongside the audited §§3-8.

## §8. Critic Second-Agent Review
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-21 -->

**Independent spot-checks (read full §§1-2 text, lines 1-134):**

1. **Footnote line 14 (action additivity → locality):**
   Claim: S[gamma_if]=S[gamma_im]+S[gamma_mf] for generic paths ⇒ L local (no cross-time kernels).
   CORRECT. Non-local L = ∫∫ F(q(t),q(t'),t,t') dtdt' violates additive splitting at partition boundary.
   Ostrogradsky caveat (∂L/∂q̈ instability → restrict to L(q,q̇,t)) correctly noted.

2. **D0.1 exponential form (lines 90-98):**
   Three conditions (multiplicative composition + log-locality + proportionality to S) → unique answer exp(c0 S/κ).
   This is the fundamental theorem on continuous homomorphisms (ℝ,+)→(ℝ_{>0},×). CORRECT.

3. **D0.2 relativistic subtraction (lines 103-117):**
   -mc²∫√(1-v²/c²) dt → -mc²T + ½mv²T + O(c⁻²). Subtraction of rest-energy constant = additive counterterm.
   Phase e^{-imc²T/ℏ}: sign is MINUS (correct, from S_rel with MINUS in front). VERIFIED.
   Field-theory caveat (vacuum energy) present. CLEAN.

4. **D3 (derivative as subtraction, sev-3):** CONCUR. Metaphor is adequately framed as "toy witness" in Heuristic.

5. **E1 (uncuttable dangling ref, sev-2):** CONCUR. Conditional on DISCARD (2/3 votes cast, 1 more needed).

6. **F3 (numbering convention, sev-3):** CONCUR. H0/P0/D0 prefix scheme is inferrable but unstated.

7. **Reader map (lines 125-130):** Three compatibilities → three section ranges. Cross-checked against actual content. CONSISTENT.

**No additional issues found beyond physicist's list.**

**Verdict: CONCUR. CLEAN. TWO-AGENT (physicist + critic).**
Full cornerstone coverage: §§1-2 (TWO-AGENT), §§3-8 (multi-agent), §§9-10 (multi-agent). 100% audited.
