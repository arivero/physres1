# Minimal RCP Axiom Set (S211)
Date: 2026-02-13
Open question #2: minimal axiom set for RCP

## 1. What's already there (cornerstone §10.3)

P10.1 states three conditions:
  (C) Partition compatibility — composition across temporal subdivisions
  (Q) Representation compatibility — ordering/discretization choices agree
  (R) Scale compatibility — predictions stable under RG flow

D10.1a gives operational closure form:
  O_{h,θ} = O_{h,τ_C(b,h;θ)} ∘ C_{b,h}  [partition]
  O_{h,θ} = O_{h,τ_Q(α;θ)} ∘ Q_α         [representation]
  O_{h,θ} = O_{h,τ_R(b;θ)} ∘ R_b           [scale]

## 2. The hierarchy: which axioms → which physics

| Axioms | Physical content | Stage |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| C alone | Action principle, Euler-Lagrange | Classical mechanics |
| C + Q | Path integral, composition law, half-density | Quantum mechanics |
| C + Q + R | Renormalization, RG running, QFT | Quantum field theory |

This is the paper's thesis stated axiomatically.

## 3. What "derive" would mean

A derivation theorem would state:
  "Given (C), (Q), and a manifold M, the unique consistent amplitude
   satisfying both conditions is K(x,y;t) = ∫ e^{iS/ℏ} Dq, with
   half-density normalization."

Needed:
(a) Formal definition of "amplitude" (function/distribution on M×M×R).
(b) Formal definition of "composition" (the sewing operation).
(c) Proof: (C)+(Q) force the Feynman-Hibbs form.

## 4. Independence proofs (sketches)

- C without Q: classical mechanics (no ordering ambiguity, no ℏ).
- Q without C: deformation quantization without dynamics (Kontsevich).
- R without C+Q: abstract semigroup on parameter space, no physics.
- C+Q without R: QM in d≤3 (no UV divergences for Kato potentials).
  The 2D delta is the simplest system requiring R.

## 5. The derivation gap

Current P10.1 is a CLASSIFICATION, not a DERIVATION:
(a) "Amplitude" is not defined axiomatically — assumed from physics.
(b) Composition law K(f,i)=∫K(f,m)K(m,i)dm is ASSUMED, not derived.
(c) Exponential form e^{iS/ℏ} is motivated (additivity→multiplicativity)
    but not proved to be the UNIQUE solution.

D4.1a shows semigroup closure fixes t^{-d/2}, but the semigroup
property itself is an axiom, not derived from (C)+(Q).

## 6. Closest existing frameworks

| Framework | Axiomatizes | Gap vs. RCP |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Atiyah TQFT (1988) | Cobordism → Hilb | Topological only |
| Segal CFT (2004) | Riemann surfaces → Hilb | Conformal only |
| Costello (2011) | Factorization algebras | Closest: R as theorem |
| Schreiber | Higher topos / AQFT | Very abstract |

Costello is closest: half-densities on field space, renormalization
derived from BV. RCP might be a special case of Costello restricted
to quantum mechanics.

## 7. Honest verdict

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is P10.1 a good classification? | YES |
| Does it derive QM? | NO |
| Can it be made into a derivation? | POSSIBLE but multi-year program |
| Should a remark go into a paper? | NO — P10.1 is already best available |

Formalization gap: real but HARD. Making these axioms fully
mathematical requires defining the category of theories, the notion
of refinement, and proving derivation theorems. This is a research
program, not a remark.

**Recommendation**: mark Q#2 as "formalization gap identified;
closing it requires new mathematical results beyond paper scope."
