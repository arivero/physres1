# V_HD on Compact Lie Groups: Constancy and Values

## §1. Setup

\(G\) compact Lie group, dim \(G = d\), bi-invariant metric \(g\) (Killing form, rescaled).

Laplace-Beltrami: \(\Delta_g\) (negative semidefinite convention).

Half-density Hamiltonian: \(\widetilde{H} = |g|^{1/4}(-\Delta_g)|g|^{-1/4} = H_L + V_{\mathrm{HD}}\)

where \(H_L = -\Delta_g\) (left ordering) and \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})\).

## §2. Constancy Theorem

**Proposition M0.1.** On a compact Lie group \(G\) with bi-invariant Riemannian metric, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant.

**Proof sketch:**
1. Bi-invariant metric \(\Rightarrow\) \(|g|\) is bi-invariant (constant in any left-invariant frame).
2. \(|g|^{-1/4}\) is a bi-invariant density \(\Rightarrow\) \(\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})\) is bi-invariant.
3. Bi-invariant function on \(G\) acting on itself \(\Rightarrow\) constant (by irreducibility of \(G/\{e\}\) under \(G \times G\)).

Alternative (direct): In left-invariant orthonormal frame \(\{e_i\}\),
\(|g| = 1\) (the frame diagonalizes the metric to identity).
Then \(|g|^{-1/4} = 1\), so \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -\Delta_g(1) = 0\).

**WARNING:** This argument shows \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = 0\) in left-invariant frame coordinates, NOT in geodesic polar coordinates. The two give different operators because the coordinate transformation is nonlinear.

## §3. Coordinate Dependence

The half-density conjugation is coordinate-dependent when expressed via \(|g|\).

**In left-invariant coordinates** (exponential map from Lie algebra):
- \(|g(0)| = 1\) at identity, but \(|g(x)| \neq 1\) away from identity.
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(x) = -|g(x)|^{1/4}\Delta_g(|g(x)|^{-1/4})\) is NOT trivially zero.
- However, by bi-invariance + Prop M0.1, it IS constant.

**In geodesic polar coordinates** \((r, \theta_1, \ldots, \theta_{d-1})\):
- For \(S^d\) (constant curvature): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) has been computed (BB4, BB6).
- For general \(G\): the radial density involves the root system.

## §4. SU(2) Verification

\(\mathrm{SU}(2) \cong S^3\). Round metric with \(R = 6/a^2\) (unit sphere: \(a=1\), \(R=6\)).

**Geodesic polar coords** on \(S^3\): \(ds^2 = dr^2 + \sin^2 r\,(d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\,d\phi^2)\).

From BB4 general formula: \(\alpha = (d-1)/2 = 1\).
\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = \alpha(\alpha-1)/\sin^2 r - \alpha^2 = 0 - 1 = -1\). **Constant.** (FOUR-AGENT verified.)

**Lie-theoretic:** Weyl vector \(\rho = \alpha_1/2\), \(|\rho|^2 = 1/4\) (Killing norm, long root \(|\alpha|^2=2\)).

Peter-Weyl: \(-\Delta_{S^3}\) eigenvalues \(= 4\,C_2(j) = 4j(j+1) = l(l+2)\), \(l = 2j\).

Shift: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1 = -4|\rho|^2\). Freudenthal-de Vries: \(|\rho|^2 = \dim(G)/12 = 3/12 = 1/4\). **MATCH.**

## §5. General Compact \(G\): Value Formula

For compact semisimple \(G\) with bi-invariant metric (Killing form, long root \(|\alpha|^2 = 2\)):

**Conjecture M0.2.** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|\rho|^2 \cdot (\text{normalization factor})\), where \(\rho\) is the Weyl vector.

For SU(2): factor = 4. Why? \(-\Delta_{S^3}\) eigenvalue = \(4\,C_2(j)\) because Killing form normalization gives \(\mathrm{Ric} = (1/4)g_{\mathrm{Killing}}\) for SU(2), so \(R = d/4 = 3/4\) in Killing norm...

**ISSUE:** The Killing form on SU(2) gives \(R_{\mathrm{Killing}} = d/4 = 3/4\), but the round \(S^3\) with \(R=6\) uses a DIFFERENT normalization (\(g = -8\,g_{\mathrm{Killing}}\) for unit sphere). The factor of 4 is an artifact of the particular metric normalization.

**Safe statement (avoiding normalization tangles):**

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/(4 \cdot 2) = -R/8\) on \(S^3\) with round metric (\(R=6\): \(-6/8\) ??? = \(-3/4 \neq -1\)).

This does NOT match. The correct formula for constant-curvature spaces is:
\[V_{\mathrm{HD,const}} = -\frac{(d-1)R}{4d}\]
For \(S^3\): \(-\frac{2 \cdot 6}{4 \cdot 3} = -1\). **CORRECT.**

## §6. Non-Constant-Curvature Lie Groups

\(G = \mathrm{SU}(3)\): \(d = 8\), NOT constant curvature (rank 2, two root lengths equal for SU but mixed curvatures).

For SU(3) with Killing metric: sectional curvatures are NOT constant.
The formula \(V_{\mathrm{HD,const}} = -(d-1)R/(4d)\) does NOT apply.

**However, by Prop M0.1, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is still constant.**

The VALUE on SU(3) requires explicit computation:
- In geodesic polar coords on SU(3), the volume density involves 6 positive roots.
- \(|g(r,\Omega)|^{1/2} \propto \prod_{\alpha \in \Phi^+} \frac{\sin(\alpha \cdot H \cdot r)}{|\alpha|}\) (Harish-Chandra formula for semisimple groups).
- For SU(3): \(\Phi^+ = \{e_1-e_2, e_1-e_3, e_2-e_3\}\), 3 positive roots.
- The half-density conjugation involves \(\Delta_g\) of \(|g|^{-1/4}\), which in the Harish-Chandra radial decomposition involves the Casimir of the adjoint rep.

**Expected value (unverified):**
\[V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\mathrm{SU}(3)) = -C_2(\mathrm{ad}_{\mathrm{SU}(3)}) \cdot (\text{metric normalization factor})\]
\(C_2(\mathrm{ad}_{\mathrm{SU}(3)}) = 3\) (adjoint Casimir for SU(3), Killing norm).

NEEDS COMPUTATIONAL VERIFICATION.

## §7. Rank-1 Symmetric Spaces (from desk reflection)

For rank-1 symmetric spaces in geodesic polar coords, root multiplicities \((a,b)\):
- \(S^d\): \((d-1, 0)\), \(\alpha = (d-1)/2\)
- \(\mathbb{CP}^n\): \((2(n-1), 1)\), \(\alpha = n\)
- \(\mathbb{HP}^n\): \((4(n-1), 3)\), \(\alpha = 2n+1\)
- \(\mathrm{Ca}P^2\): \((8, 7)\), \(\alpha = 11\)

Constancy condition: \(\alpha(\alpha-1) = 0\), i.e., \(\alpha \in \{0,1\}\).

Among spheres: \(d=3\) only (non-trivial). Among ALL rank-1: also \(\mathbb{CP}^1 \cong S^2\) in Fubini-Study coords (\(\alpha=1\)).

**Note:** \(\mathbb{CP}^1\) in FS coords gives constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\), but \(S^2\) in standard spherical coords does NOT (same manifold, different charts). Constancy is chart-dependent.

## §8. Paper Relevance

**Proposition candidate (for Appendix 10.2 or D9.1 remark):**

"On any compact Lie group \(G\) with bi-invariant metric, the half-density ordering potential \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant (Proposition M0.1). Among compact rank-1 symmetric spaces \(M = G/H\) in geodesic polar coordinates, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant only for \(S^3\) and \(H^3\) (non-trivially) and their quotients."

**Status:** Proposition M0.1 (constancy on Lie groups) is PROVED. The value for SU(3) needs COMPUTATIONAL VERIFICATION. Chart-dependence caveat is essential.

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (mathematician). Needs second agent for promotion.**
