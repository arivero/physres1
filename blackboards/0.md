# Blackboard 0 — Cauchy completion as prototypical "uncuttable" (Section 1, uncuttable)

## Target
Remark 1.1 in uncuttable paper, after line 20 (end of Section 1 intro), before Section 2.

## Core content

The real numbers are the prototypical "uncuttable" limit object.

The construction:
- Finite approximants: rational numbers Q — each is a finite decimal/fraction
- Refinement rule: Cauchy sequences (a_n) in Q
- Equivalence structure: two Cauchy sequences are identified if their
  difference converges to zero: (a_n) ~ (b_n) iff |a_n - b_n| → 0
- The limit object: R = Q̂ (the Cauchy completion)

No single rational approximant IS the real number √2. The real number is
the equivalence class of all Cauchy sequences of rationals converging to it.
The "control data" is the metric that defines Cauchy convergence and the
equivalence relation that identifies sequences with the same limit.

This matches Section 1's definition exactly:
1. Finite approximants Q_N (partial decimal expansions) exist
2. The value is the limit, not any finite Q_N
3. The refinement rule (metric + equivalence) is part of the definition

The same Cauchy-completion pattern appears throughout the paper:
- The Riemann integral (Section 2) is the completion of step functions
  under the L¹ norm
- The path integral (Section 3) is the "completion" of piecewise-linear
  paths under the Wiener measure
- The continuum QFT (Section 4) is the "completion" of lattice theories
  under the RG flow

The deeper structural point: completion can introduce new structure not
visible at any finite stage. The reals contain irrationals, transcendentals,
and the continuum hypothesis itself — properties that no finite collection
of rationals exhibits. Similarly, the continuum QFT can have anomalies,
non-perturbative sectors, and phase transitions absent from any finite
lattice approximant.
