# Bargmann Representation: Action-Angle Duality as Holomorphic Transform
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S149

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 6 (after Remark 6.7 on spin coherent states, before Section 7). The paper repeatedly contrasts Fock states (sharp action, ring in phase space) with coherent states (localized phase, blob). The Bargmann-Segal representation makes this duality algebraic: the Hilbert space becomes L²-holomorphic functions on ℂ, coherent states become delta-function kernels, and Fock states become monomials zⁿ/√(n!).

## Key Claims

### The Bargmann transform
The Bargmann representation (Bargmann, 1961; Segal, 1963) maps each state ψ in the oscillator Hilbert space to a holomorphic function on ℂ:

  f(z) = ⟨z*|ψ⟩ = Σ_n c_n z^n / √(n!)

where |ψ⟩ = Σ_n c_n |n⟩ and z = (x + ip/ω)/(√(2ℏ/ω)). The inner product is:

  ⟨f|g⟩ = (1/π) ∫ f(z)* g(z) e^{-|z|²} d²z

### How this connects to the paper's themes

1. **Fock states as monomials**: |n⟩ ↦ z^n/√(n!). The action eigenstate becomes the simplest algebraic object — a monomial. The uniform phase distribution of |n⟩ maps to the rotational symmetry of |z|^{2n}: invariant under z ↦ e^{iθ}z.

2. **Coherent states as reproducing kernels**: |α⟩ ↦ e^{αz}, which serves as the reproducing kernel of the Bargmann space: f(α) = ⟨K_α|f⟩ where K_α(z) = e^{ᾱz}. The coherent state is thus the "evaluation functional" — it extracts the value at a point, the ultimate localization.

3. **Creation/annihilation as multiplication/differentiation**: â† ↦ z (multiplication), â ↦ d/dz (differentiation). The action-angle algebra becomes multiplication vs differentiation on holomorphic functions. The uncertainty principle ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2 becomes the statement that a holomorphic function cannot be simultaneously localized and band-limited (a Paley-Wiener type constraint).

4. **The Husimi function is the Bargmann modulus squared**: Q(α) = |f(α)|² e^{-|α|²}/π. So the Husimi phase-space portrait of Remark 6.4 is literally the squared modulus of the Bargmann representative, weighted by the Gaussian measure. The ring-vs-blob distinction of Remarks 6.4-6.5 is the distinction between |z^n/√(n!)|² (ring) and |e^{α₀z}|² (peaked).

### Connection to angular momentum
The spin-j Bargmann space is the space of polynomials of degree ≤ 2j in a complex variable (Schwinger's oscillator construction). The spin coherent states of Remark 6.7 become evaluation points on CP¹ ≅ S². This is the finite-dimensional analog of the full Bargmann space.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 6.8, after Remark 6.7 (spin coherent states), before Section 7.

Content: The Bargmann representation makes the action-angle duality algebraic: Fock states ↦ monomials zⁿ/√(n!), coherent states ↦ reproducing kernels e^{αz}, creation/annihilation ↦ multiplication/differentiation. The Husimi function of Remark 6.4 is the squared modulus of the Bargmann representative. The ring-vs-blob duality of Remarks 6.4-6.7 is the contrast between rotationally symmetric monomials and peaked exponentials.
