# Zeta-Function Regularization
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S166

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 2 (after Remark 2.6 on optimal truncation, before Section 3).
Section 2 builds a tower of refinement/regularization methods: counterterms (2.1-2.2),
Euler-Maclaurin (2.3), Richardson extrapolation (2.4), Padé/Borel (2.5), optimal truncation
(2.6). Zeta-function regularization is the next natural method — it assigns finite values
to formally divergent sums/products by analytic continuation.

## Key Claims

### Zeta-function regularization (Riemann, Hawking 1977)
The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) = Σ_{n=1}^∞ n^{-s} converges for Re(s)>1 and extends
meromorphically to all s with a simple pole at s=1. The formal divergent sum
1+2+3+... = Σ n = ζ(-1) = -1/12 is the analytic continuation value.

For a quantum field with eigenvalues {λ_n}, the spectral zeta function
ζ_A(s) = Σ λ_n^{-s} regularizes the determinant via:
ln det A = -ζ_A'(0)

### Connection to paper's themes
1. Zeta regularization is the "uncuttable" pattern at its purest: no cutoff is introduced;
   the sum is defined by its analytic structure across the complex plane
2. The Casimir energy (Remark 5.7 of fermionic) can be computed via zeta regularization:
   E_Casimir = (1/2) Σ ω_n → (1/2) μ^s Σ ω_n^{1-s} |_{s=0}
3. Connects to Euler-Maclaurin (Remark 2.3): both use Bernoulli numbers
4. The value ζ(-1) = -1/12 appears in string theory (critical dimension d=26 from
   1+2+3+... = -1/12) and in the Casimir effect

### Limitations
- Not universal: some divergences cannot be regulated by analytic continuation alone
- May break symmetries (gauge invariance requires careful treatment)
- In some cases gives scheme-dependent finite parts

## Proposed Remark
Remark 2.7 in uncuttable paper (after optimal truncation).
