# Spin Coherent States on S²: Action-Angle Packets for Angular Momentum
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S141

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 6 (after Example 6.2, hydrogen). The harmonic oscillator coherent states (Example 6.1) localize the orbit phase for a 1D system. Spin coherent states (Radcliffe 1971, Perelomov 1972) do the same for angular momentum on the sphere: they localize the direction (θ,φ) at the cost of spreading the magnetic quantum number m.

## Key Claims

### Definition
For a spin-j system (j = l for orbital angular momentum), the spin coherent state pointing in direction n̂ = (θ₀,φ₀) is:
  |j,n̂⟩ = R(θ₀,φ₀)|j,j⟩

where R(θ₀,φ₀) = exp(-iφ₀ Jz/ℏ) exp(-iθ₀ Jy/ℏ) is the rotation operator that takes the north pole to n̂. Expanding in the |j,m⟩ basis:

  |j,n̂⟩ = Σ_m √(C(2j, j+m)) cos^{j+m}(θ₀/2) sin^{j-m}(θ₀/2) e^{-imφ₀} |j,m⟩

where C(2j, j+m) is the binomial coefficient. The m-distribution is binomial with mean m̄ = j cos θ₀ and variance Var(m) = (j/2) sin²θ₀.

### Properties as action-angle packets
1. **Direction localization**: The expectation value of J points along n̂ with |⟨J⟩| = jℏ (maximal). The angular uncertainty in the direction is Δθ ~ 1/√j — the angular blob shrinks for large j, approaching a classical point on the sphere.

2. **m-spreading**: Since ⟨Jz⟩ = jℏ cos θ₀ and Var(Jz) = (j/2)ℏ² sin²θ₀, the coherent state at the equator (θ₀=π/2) has maximal m-spread: Var(m) = j/2, occupying ~√j of the 2j+1 available m-modes. This is the angular-momentum analog of the Poisson distribution over Fock states in Example 6.1.

3. **Minimum uncertainty**: Spin coherent states minimize the SU(2) intelligent uncertainty relation: ΔJ₁ · ΔJ₂ ≥ (ℏ/2)|⟨J₃⟩|, where (J₁, J₂, J₃) is a frame adapted to n̂. They are the closest quantum states to a "classical angular momentum vector pointing in direction n̂."

4. **Classical limit**: As j→∞, the spin coherent states become delta-concentrated on the classical phase space S² = CP¹, and expectation values of J components follow classical rigid-body or precession dynamics (Lieb 1973).

### Overcompleteness and resolution of identity
Like harmonic oscillator coherent states, spin coherent states form an overcomplete set:
  (2j+1)/(4π) ∫ |j,n̂⟩⟨j,n̂| dΩ = 𝟙

where dΩ = sin θ dθ dφ is the solid angle. The overcompleteness factor (2j+1)/(4π) counts the number of orthogonal states per unit solid angle — the "phase space volume per quantum state."

### Connection to the paper's message
The spin coherent state |j,n̂⟩ is to the |j,m⟩ eigenstates exactly what the harmonic-oscillator coherent state |α⟩ is to the Fock states |n⟩:
- |j,m⟩: sharp action (definite m), delocalized angle (uniform in φ for given m)
- |j,n̂⟩: localized direction (definite n̂), spread over many m-modes

This directly extends the action-angle tradeoff from the flat (oscillator) case to the spherical (angular momentum) case.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 6.7 or 7.3, in Section 6 after Example 6.2 (hydrogen atom), or in Section 7 outlook.

Content: Spin coherent states as the angular-momentum analog of harmonic oscillator coherent states: they localize the angular momentum direction at the cost of m-spread, with the angular uncertainty scaling as 1/√j. The classical rigid-body limit (j→∞) parallels the classical oscillator limit (|α|→∞).
