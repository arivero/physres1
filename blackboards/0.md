# Dispersion Relations and Kramers-Kronig
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S168

## Context
Target: fermionic paper, Section 3 (after Remark 3.4 on Schwinger/Euler-Heisenberg).
Section 3 discusses how fermion loops modify bosonic propagators (vacuum polarization,
Uehling potential, anomalous magnetic moment). Dispersion relations connect the real
and imaginary parts of the vacuum polarization Π(q²) — the imaginary part gives the
pair-creation threshold, the real part (via Kramers-Kronig) gives the running coupling.

## Key Claims

### Kramers-Kronig / dispersion relations
For a causal, linear response function χ(ω) analytic in the upper half-plane:
Re χ(ω) = (1/π) P ∫ Im χ(ω')/(ω'-ω) dω'
Im χ(ω) = -(1/π) P ∫ Re χ(ω')/(ω'-ω) dω'

### Application to vacuum polarization
The vacuum polarization function Π(q²) is analytic in q² except for a branch cut
starting at q² = 4m² (pair-creation threshold). The optical theorem relates
Im Π(q²) to the total cross section σ(e⁺e⁻ → hadrons). The real part (running
coupling) is then determined by a dispersion integral:
Re Π(q²) = (q²/π) ∫_{4m²}^∞ Im Π(s)/(s(s-q²)) ds

### Connection to the paper
1. Links vacuum polarization (Section 3.1) to pair creation (Remark 3.4):
   the real part (running coupling) and imaginary part (pair threshold) are two
   faces of the same analytic function
2. The dispersion relation is another "refinement" structure: the function is
   determined by its singularities (the "contact data" on the branch cut)
3. Connects to the ERE (Remark 4.2): effective range parameters are also determined
   by dispersion relations over the scattering amplitude

## Proposed Remark
Remark 3.5 (renumbering old 3.5→3.6 etc.) or better: insert after Remark 3.4
as new Remark 3.5, pushing old 3.4 from "Schwinger pair production" to remain 3.4
and inserting AFTER it.

Actually, simpler: Remark 3.5 after current Remark 3.4. No renumbering needed if
3.4 is the last in Section 3.
