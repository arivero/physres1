# Blackboard 0 — Crossing symmetry and the Grassmann obstruction (Section 2, fermionic)

## Target
Remark 2.2 in fermionic paper, after Remark 2.1 (Källén-Lehmann),
before Section 3.

## Core content

Crossing symmetry connects the three Mandelstam channels (s, t, u)
of a 2→2 scattering amplitude. The bosonic exchange potential of
Section 2 arises from the t-channel (momentum transfer q):
  K^{-1}(q²) evaluated at spacelike q (static limit)
The same amplitude analytically continued to timelike s gives the
scattering/production cross-section (s-channel).

For bosonic exchange:
- t-channel exchange: A(t) ~ g²/(t - m²), static limit gives Yukawa
- s-channel: same amplitude at t → s gives resonance/production
- Crossing relates amplitudes in different channels: A(s,t,u) is the
  SAME analytic function evaluated in different kinematic regions

Key point for this paper:
- The Grassmann obstruction (Section 3) is specific to the t-channel
  "classical source → potential" reading. It does NOT affect:
  1. Loop contributions (Section 3.1) — these are well-defined
  2. Scattering amplitudes — the S-matrix elements for fermion exchange
     processes are perfectly well-defined (they involve sums over
     intermediate states, not classical source elimination)
- Crossing relates the spacelike (potential) and timelike (production)
  regimes through the same dispersion relations of Remark 3.5
- The spectral representation of Remark 2.1 provides the unitarity
  cuts that crossing relates across channels

The Froissart-Martin bound: σ_tot ≤ C (ln s)² as s → ∞, following
from crossing symmetry + unitarity + polynomial boundedness (the
Froissart bound, 1961; strengthened by Martin, 1963). This constrains
how fast cross-sections can grow — a consequence of the same analyticity
that underlies the static potential reading.
