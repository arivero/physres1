# Unitarity Limit and Universal Few-Body Physics

## Context
The fermionic mediators satellite (Examples 5.1, 5.2) shows that contact couplings
are RG data, not bare numbers. What happens at the RG fixed point — i.e., when the
scattering length a → ±∞?

## Key claims

1. **Scale invariance at unitarity.** When |a| → ∞, the only remaining length scales
   are the interparticle spacing n^{-1/3} and the thermal wavelength. The contact
   coupling sits at a non-trivial RG fixed point where β(g*) = 0. The theory is
   scale-invariant (Schrödinger conformal symmetry applies at unitarity).

2. **Bertsch parameter.** For a spin-1/2 Fermi gas at unitarity, the ground-state
   energy is E = ξ · E_FG where E_FG = (3/5)N·E_F is the free Fermi gas energy.
   The Bertsch parameter ξ ≈ 0.376(5) is universal — independent of microscopic
   details. Measured in cold-atom experiments (Li-6, K-40 near Feshbach resonances).

3. **Feshbach resonance as experimental tuning.** External magnetic field near a
   Feshbach resonance tunes the scattering length through a → ±∞. This is a
   laboratory realization of moving the coupling along its beta function, passing
   through the fixed point.

4. **BEC-BCS crossover.** On one side (a > 0, small), fermion pairs form tightly
   bound bosonic dimers → BEC. On the other (a < 0, |a| small compared to
   interparticle spacing), pairs are loosely correlated → BCS superconductor.
   At unitarity (|a| = ∞), neither picture applies; the system is strongly
   correlated and universal.

5. **Efimov effect (three-body).** At unitarity, a discrete scaling symmetry
   emerges in the three-body sector: an infinite geometric series of three-body
   bound states with energy ratio ≈ 1/515 (identical bosons). This introduces
   one additional parameter (three-body force) beyond the two-body scattering
   length. (Note: most dramatic for bosons; subtler for fermions.)

## Reviewer feedback (cold-atom experimentalist)
All 5 claims CORRECT (minor caveats on claim 3: "RG flow" is interpretive;
claim 5: Efimov strongest for bosons, less central for fermionic paper).
Recommends: focus on claims 1-4 in the remark, omit Efimov unless space allows.

## Proposed remark for fermionic mediators satellite
~3 lines as Remark 5.3. Mention ξ ≈ 0.37, Feshbach tuning, BEC-BCS crossover.
Connect to the "flow, not number" message of Examples 5.1-5.2.
