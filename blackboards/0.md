# Geometric Quantization: Action-Angle Structure Made Systematic
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S158

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 6 (after Remark 6.8 on Bargmann representation) or Section 7 (outlook).
The paper uses action-angle pairs as the central structural motif. Geometric quantization is the systematic mathematical framework that explains WHY action-angle structure determines the quantum theory: the actions are the generators of the U(1) fibration, and quantization of the actions to integers is the prequantization condition.

## Key Claims

### Prequantization (Kostant 1970, Souriau 1966)
Given a symplectic manifold (M, ω), prequantization constructs a line bundle L → M with connection whose curvature equals ω/ℏ. The prequantization condition requires [ω/(2πℏ)] to be an integral cohomology class — i.e., the action integrals around any closed cycle must be integer multiples of ℏ:

  (1/2πℏ) ∮_γ ω ∈ Z

For the harmonic oscillator on T*R, ω = dp∧dq, the action variable J = ∮ p dq/(2π) is quantized to J = (n+½)ℏ — exactly the EBK condition of Remark 6.3.

### Polarization (choice of half of the variables)
The prequantum Hilbert space is too large (it's L²(M)). A polarization — a choice of "position-like" variables (a Lagrangian foliation of the symplectic manifold) — reduces it to the physical Hilbert space. Different polarizations give unitarily equivalent quantum theories (by the BKS theorem, at least for compact M).

For integrable systems with action-angle variables (I, θ):
- **Real polarization** (action polarization): wave functions depend on actions I only → Fock/number states |n⟩
- **Complex polarization** (Kähler): wave functions are holomorphic → Bargmann representation of Remark 6.8

The connection between polarization choice and the paper's ring-vs-blob distinction:
- Action polarization → states sharp in I, delocalized in θ → rings (Remark 6.4)
- Complex polarization → coherent states → blobs (Example 6.1)

### Metaplectic correction
The naive geometric quantization produces energies E_n = nℏω for the oscillator — missing the ½ℏω zero-point energy. The metaplectic correction (Blattner, Kostant, Sternberg) accounts for the half-density structure, adding the ½ to recover E_n = (n+½)ℏω. This connects directly to the cornerstone manuscript's half-density theme.

### Connection to the paper's themes
1. **EBK quantization**: The prequantization condition IS the EBK condition — Remark 6.3's action quantization is literally the integrality of the Chern class of the line bundle.
2. **Bargmann representation**: Complex polarization on the oscillator phase space gives the Bargmann-Segal space of Remark 6.8.
3. **Maslov index**: The metaplectic correction accounts for the Maslov index — the topological contribution to the phase that appears in EBK (Remark 6.3) and WKB (uncuttable Remark 3.6).
4. **Spin coherent states**: The spin-j coherent states of Remark 6.7 arise from geometric quantization of S² = CP¹ with ω = j sin θ dθ∧dφ, where the prequantization condition forces 2j ∈ Z.

## Proposed Remark
Remark 7.5 in action-angle Section 7, after Remark 7.4 (Gutzwiller).
Content: Geometric quantization as the systematic framework. Prequantization condition = EBK action quantization = integrality of the line bundle's Chern class. Real polarization → number/Fock states (rings), complex polarization → Bargmann representation (blobs). Metaplectic correction adds ½ℏω (half-density structure). Spin coherent states from quantization of S².
