# Levinson's Theorem
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S172

## Context
Target: fermionic paper, Section 5 (after Remark 5.4 on dimensional dependence, or
after Remark 5.7 on Casimir). Levinson's theorem connects the s-wave scattering
phase shift at zero energy to the number of bound states: δ(0) = n_b π (mod π).
This is a direct link between boundary-condition data (phase shift / scattering
length) and bound-state counting — the spectral content of the self-adjoint extension.

## Key Claims

### Levinson's theorem (1949)
For a potential V(r) in 3D with n_b s-wave bound states:
  δ_0(k=0) - δ_0(k=∞) = n_b π
(with a half-integer correction if there is a zero-energy resonance/half-bound state).

### Connection to self-adjoint extensions
The scattering length a is related to the zero-energy phase shift:
  k cot δ_0(k) → -1/a  as k → 0
Levinson's theorem constrains how many times the phase shift can cross π
(i.e., how many bound states exist) given the asymptotic behavior — it connects
the IR data (a, phase shift) to spectral counting.

### Connection to paper's themes
1. Directly links boundary-condition data (Section 5's theme) to bound-state
   spectrum — the phase shift "knows" the bound-state count
2. The half-bound-state exception (δ(0) = (n_b + 1/2)π) occurs precisely when
   |a| = ∞, i.e., at the unitarity limit of Remark 5.3
3. Connects to Remark 4.2 (ERE): the scattering length a parametrizes both
   low-energy scattering and bound-state existence

## Proposed Remark
Remark 5.8 in fermionic (after Remark 5.7 on Casimir).
