# Blackboard 0 — Dedekind cuts vs Cauchy sequences (Section 1, uncuttable)

## Target
Remark 1.3 in uncuttable paper, after Remark 1.2 (Zeno's paradoxes),
before Section 2.

## Core content

Remark 1.1 notes that the reals arise as Cauchy-sequence completion of Q
under the standard metric, and that different metrics (p-adic) yield
different completions. A complementary point: even for the *same* target
(the reals), there are structurally different construction procedures.

Dedekind cuts (1872): A real number is a partition (L,U) of Q into a
lower set L and upper set U with L < U and L having no maximum. The
ordering on cuts is set inclusion of lower sets. No metric or limit
concept is needed — the construction is purely order-theoretic.

Cauchy sequences (Méray 1869, Cantor 1872): A real number is an
equivalence class of Cauchy sequences in (Q, |·|). The construction
uses the metric (distance function) essentially.

Both produce the same ordered field (up to unique isomorphism), but the
"refinement data" is different:
- Cauchy: metric + convergence criterion → analytic flavour
- Dedekind: linear order + completeness (every bounded subset has a
  supremum) → algebraic/order-theoretic flavour

This foreshadows dualities (Remark 4.8): different "refinement paths"
converging to the same limit object.

Key nuance: the two constructions generalize differently.
- Cauchy completion works in any metric space → p-adic completions,
  completion of normed algebras (Banach spaces), etc.
- Dedekind completion works in any linearly ordered set → but does NOT
  generalize to higher dimensions or non-ordered settings.
- For the specific case of Q→R, they agree. For more general settings,
  only one or the other applies.

Connection to the paper:
- Directly extends Remark 1.1 (which only mentions Cauchy completion)
- Illustrates that the "control data" (item 3 of the definition) can
  take structurally different forms while producing the same limit
- Foreshadows Remark 4.8 (dualities): multiple descriptions of the
  same "uncuttable" object
- Also connects to Remark 3.8 (Stone-von Neumann uniqueness): when
  do different construction procedures yield the same result?
