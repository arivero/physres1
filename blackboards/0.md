# Ehrenfest Time: When Wavepackets Stop Tracking Classical Orbits
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S143

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 5 (after Remark 5.2 on decoherence) or Section 7 (after Remark 7.2 on spectral statistics). The paper argues that orbit pictures require coherent packets. The Ehrenfest time quantifies how long a packet follows the classical orbit before quantum spreading dominates.

## Key Claims

### The Ehrenfest theorem
Ehrenfest (1927): for a quantum state,
  d⟨x⟩/dt = ⟨p⟩/m,   d⟨p⟩/dt = -⟨V'(x)⟩

These are NOT the classical equations unless ⟨V'(x)⟩ = V'(⟨x⟩), which holds exactly only for potentials at most quadratic (harmonic oscillator, free particle, uniform field).

For anharmonic potentials, the correction is ⟨V'(x)⟩ - V'(⟨x⟩) ≈ V'''(⟨x⟩)·(Δx)² /2 + ..., which becomes significant when the wavepacket width Δx grows large enough that the potential curvature varies across the packet.

### Ehrenfest time for integrable systems
For a smooth integrable system, a minimum-uncertainty wavepacket initially localized to size Δx₀ spreads as:
  Δx(t) ~ Δx₀ + (ℏt)/(mΔx₀)    (free spreading)

For a harmonic oscillator: NO spreading — coherent states remain coherent for all time (this is why Example 6.1 works so well).

For anharmonic potentials: the packet disperses on the timescale
  t_disp ~ mΔx₀/ℏ · (length scale of potential variation)

This is essentially the revival time of Remark 5.1: t_rev ~ 2πℏ/|d²E/dm²|.

### Ehrenfest time for chaotic systems (the logarithmic timescale)
For classically chaotic systems with Lyapunov exponent λ, nearby classical trajectories diverge exponentially: δx(t) ~ δx(0)·e^{λt}. A quantum wavepacket of initial size Δx₀ ~ √ℏ (minimum uncertainty) follows the classical trajectory until the exponential stretching has amplified quantum uncertainty to a classical scale L:

  √ℏ · e^{λ·t_E} ~ L

Solving:
  t_E ~ (1/λ) ln(L/√ℏ) ~ (1/(2λ)) ln(1/ℏ)

This is the **Ehrenfest time** — logarithmic in 1/ℏ, hence absurdly short on macroscopic timescales. For t < t_E, the wavepacket follows the classical orbit; for t > t_E, the quantum state has spread across the available phase space and the classical orbit picture breaks down completely.

### Connection to the paper
1. **Section 5 message**: "orbit pictures require packets" — the Ehrenfest time quantifies exactly how long such packets remain valid.
2. **Remark 5.1** (quantum revivals): for integrable systems, the dispersal timescale is algebraic in ℏ (t_disp ~ 1/ℏ or polynomial). For chaotic systems, it is logarithmic — much shorter.
3. **Remark 7.1** (integrability breaking): the Ehrenfest time is the boundary in time of the classical-orbit picture, just as KAM is the boundary in parameter space.
4. **Contrast**: integrable systems have algebraic Ehrenfest time, chaotic systems have logarithmic — a dramatic difference.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 7.3 (in Section 7, after Remark 7.2 on spectral statistics). This connects the spatial/spectral transitions of Remarks 7.1-7.2 to the temporal regime.

Content: The Ehrenfest time t_E ~ (1/λ)ln(1/ℏ) as the timescale beyond which wavepackets no longer track classical orbits. For integrable systems, packet dispersal is algebraic in ℏ (Remark 5.1's revival time); for chaotic systems, exponential trajectory divergence compresses this to logarithmic — the temporal counterpart of the phase-space and spectral transitions in Remarks 7.1-7.2.
