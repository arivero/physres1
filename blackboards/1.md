# Decoherence and Pointer States in Action-Angle Systems
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S135

## Context
The action-angle paper's Section 5 makes the foundational point: classical orbit
pictures require coherent superpositions, not single eigenstates. Remark 5.1
adds a temporal constraint (revivals). But neither addresses WHY coherent states
are the ones we observe classically — that's decoherence's job.

## Key claims

1. **Pointer states from decoherence.** When a quantum system interacts with an
   environment, superpositions decohere into mixtures. The "pointer states" that
   survive decoherence are those most robust against entanglement with the
   environment. For oscillator systems coupled to thermal baths, pointer states
   are typically coherent states (localized in both action and angle) — not Fock
   states (sharp action, delocalized angle). This was established by Zurek
   (1981, 1993) and Joos & Zeh (1985).

2. **Why coherent states are pointer states.** For a harmonic oscillator coupled
   to an environment via position (x-coupling), coherent states minimize the
   rate of entanglement production. Fock states, by contrast, decohere rapidly:
   a superposition |n⟩ + |m⟩ loses coherence on a timescale
   t_dec ~ t_relax / |n-m|², where t_relax is the thermal relaxation time.
   Higher Fock states are MORE fragile, not less. This is because the position
   operator (the coupling to the environment) does not commute with the number
   operator: [a†a, x] ≠ 0.

3. **Action-angle interpretation.** Decoherence completes the foundations
   message of Section 5: not only do classical orbit pictures require coherent
   superpositions (Section 4) with temporal coherence (Remark 5.1), but
   decoherence provides the dynamical mechanism that SELECTS these packets as
   the robust states. The sharp-action eigenstates (Fock states, L_z eigenstates)
   are fragile under typical environment couplings; the localized-angle packets
   (coherent states) are robust. The classical limit requires both ℏ→0
   (semiclassical localization) and environment coupling (decoherence selection).

4. **Caveat: coupling dependence.** The pointer basis depends on the system-
   environment coupling. For x-coupling → coherent states. For energy coupling
   (e.g., pure dephasing) → energy eigenstates are the pointer states. In most
   physically relevant situations (macroscopic systems coupled to position-
   dependent forces), x-coupling dominates, making coherent states the generic
   pointer basis. But this is a physical input, not a theorem about all systems.

## Proposed remark
Remark 5.2 (~3 sentences) after Remark 5.1. Note that decoherence selects
coherent states (localized in both action and angle) as pointer states under
typical environment couplings, providing the dynamical mechanism for why
classical orbit pictures emerge. Connect to the "orbit pictures require packets"
message of Section 5.

### Claim-by-claim assessment

**Claim 1: Coherent states are pointer states for x-coupled oscillators**
**CORRECT.** This is well-established in the literature. Zurek, Habib, and Paz (1993, PRL 70, 1187) showed that coherent states minimize entropy production under environmental interaction and emerge as the preferred pointer basis for position-coupled harmonic oscillators. Joos & Zeh (1985, Z. Phys. B 59, 223) demonstrated that scattering interactions (position-dependent) select localized states. The mechanism is that coherent states minimize the rate of entanglement with the environment for typical (position or momentum) couplings.

**Claim 2: Decoherence timescale t_dec ~ t_relax / |n-m|²**
**UNCERTAIN / IMPRECISE NOTATION.** The scaling with quantum number differences is qualitatively correct: higher-energy Fock state superpositions decohere faster than lower-energy ones, and the rate increases with the difference in quantum numbers. However, the specific formula "t_dec ~ t_relax / |n-m|²" as written is oversimplified. The actual decoherence rate depends on the specific coupling model and involves factors like the localization length, temperature, and coupling strength. The standard result is that decoherence time scales as τ_D ~ ℏ²/(mγkTΔx²), where Δx is the position-space separation. For Fock states |n⟩ + |m⟩, the effective Δx grows with √(|n-m|), giving a rate that scales with (n-m), not (n-m)². The blackboard's claim needs refinement: the key point is that higher Fock states are MORE fragile (correct), but the precise scaling depends on the observable and coupling.

**Claim 3: Coupling dependence of pointer basis**
**CORRECT.** This is a fundamental and well-understood result. For pure dephasing (energy coupling), energy eigenstates are pointer states. For position/momentum coupling, coherent states (localized wave packets) are pointer states. This coupling-dependence is explicitly discussed in Schlosshauer (2019, Phys. Rep. 831, 1-57) and earlier reviews. The statement that "x-coupling dominates" for macroscopic systems is also correct—most physical environments couple through position-dependent forces (electromagnetic scattering, collisions, etc.).

**Claim 4: Attribution to Zurek (1981, 1993) and Joos & Zeh (1985)**
**MOSTLY CORRECT, with minor clarification.** The 1985 Joos & Zeh paper (Z. Phys. B 59, 223) is correctly cited. Zurek's foundational work on environment-induced superselection began around 1981-1982, though the specific "coherent states via decoherence" result is from Zurek, Habib & Paz (1993, PRL 70, 1187), NOT a 1981 paper. A 1991 Physics Today review by Zurek is also widely cited for pedagogical purposes. The attribution should be refined to cite the 1993 PRL for the specific coherent-state pointer-state result.

**Other issues:**
The commutator argument "[a†a, x] ≠ 0" (line 28) is correct and important—it explains WHY Fock states decohere under position coupling. However, the note should clarify that this is for LINEAR coupling (x or p); for nonlinear couplings or energy-based interactions, the pointer basis changes. Also, the statement "classical limit requires both ℏ→0 (semiclassical localization) and environment coupling (decoherence selection)" is philosophically contentious. Many researchers (including Zurek) argue that decoherence, NOT the ℏ→0 limit, is the primary mechanism for classicality. The ℏ→0 limit is a formal mathematical device, but real macroscopic systems are never in this regime—they are simply strongly decohered.

### Recommendation for revision
1. Replace "Zurek (1981, 1993)" with "Zurek, Habib & Paz (1993)" for the coherent-state result, and add "Zurek (1991)" if citing the Physics Today review separately.
2. Clarify the decoherence timescale formula: emphasize the qualitative point (higher Fock states decohere faster, rate increases with quantum number difference) but avoid the specific "t_relax / |n-m|²" formula without more context or derivation.
3. Soften the "classical limit requires both ℏ→0 and decoherence" phrasing: consider "classical behavior emerges from decoherence (environment selection of robust states) combined with semiclassical localization (wavepacket structure)."
4. Add Schlosshauer (2019, Phys. Rep.) as a modern comprehensive reference.

Overall: The blackboard note captures the essential physics correctly. The main issues are citation precision (1993 vs 1981 for Zurek's coherent-state result) and the oversimplified decoherence timescale formula. With minor revisions, this would provide solid grounding for Remark 5.2.
