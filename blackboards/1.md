# Effective Field Theory: Refinement Hierarchy Across Scales
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S150

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 4 (after Remark 4.3 on lattice gauge theory). The paper describes the "uncuttable" pattern: limits defined by refinement rules. EFT is the systematic framework for organizing physical theories as a hierarchy of refinement levels, with matching conditions across scales providing the "comparison structure" of Section 1's definition.

## Key Claims

### The EFT paradigm
Effective field theory (Wilson, 1969; Weinberg, 1979; Polchinski, 1984) organizes physical predictions as a tower of Lagrangians valid at successively lower energy scales:

  L_UV → L_EFT(Λ₁) → L_EFT(Λ₂) → ... → L_IR

Each effective Lagrangian L_EFT(Λ) includes all operators consistent with the symmetries, organized by dimension:

  L_EFT = Σ_i (c_i / Λ^{d_i - 4}) O_i

where d_i is the mass dimension of operator O_i. Operators with d_i > 4 (irrelevant) are suppressed by powers of (E/Λ) and become negligible at low energies — this is the decoupling of heavy physics.

### Matching conditions
At each threshold μ_heavy (where a heavy particle is "integrated out"), the Wilson coefficients c_i must satisfy matching conditions:

  c_i^{below}(μ_heavy) = c_i^{above}(μ_heavy) + Δc_i(μ_heavy)

where Δc_i encodes the short-distance contribution of the heavy particle. These matching conditions are the "comparison across refinements" of Section 1: they specify how the lower-resolution theory (L_EFT below the threshold) relates to the higher-resolution theory above it.

### Connection to the paper's themes

1. **Definition 1 instantiated**: The family of EFTs {L_EFT(Λ)} is a refinement family indexed by energy scale. No single EFT at any finite Λ captures all physics — the full theory is the limit (or rather, the consistent tower). The refinement rule is the RG flow; the comparison structure is the matching conditions.

2. **Counterterm tower as refinement data**: The Wilson coefficients c_i at each scale are the "extra data" needed to specify the theory at that resolution. They run with scale (RG equations) and must be matched at thresholds — this is the refinement compatibility condition.

3. **Connection to Section 2**: The Taylor-coefficient towers of Remark 2.2 and the Richardson extrapolation of Remark 2.4 are the numerical-analysis counterparts of the EFT matching: each "level" peels off a leading correction, and the full result requires the complete tower.

4. **Connection to Remark 4.1 (Wilson's RG)**: While Remark 4.1 describes Wilson's RG as the abstract framework, EFT is the practical implementation: a concrete set of operator coefficients, running equations, and matching conditions at each scale. The two are complementary perspectives on the same structure.

### The Standard Model as an EFT
The Standard Model itself is understood as an EFT valid below some scale Λ_NP (new physics threshold). The dimension-6 operators (Buchmuller and Wyler, 1986; updated in the "Warsaw basis" by Grzadkowski et al., 2010) parametrize deviations from the SM due to unknown heavy physics, with coefficients suppressed by 1/Λ_NP². Current LHC bounds constrain many of these coefficients, effectively probing the matching conditions to the UV theory without knowing the UV theory itself.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 4.4, after Remark 4.3 (lattice gauge theory), before the closing paragraph of Section 4.

Content: EFT as the systematic refinement hierarchy. Each scale's Lagrangian is an approximant; matching conditions across thresholds are the comparison structure; the full theory is the consistent tower. The Wilson coefficients are the "extra data" that must be specified at each resolution level. The Standard Model as an EFT exemplifies the pattern: dimension-6 operators parametrize the refinement corrections from unknown UV physics.
