# Kadanoff Block Spins
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S179

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 4 (as Remark 4.10 after Remark 4.9 on Callan-Symanzik).
Kadanoff's block-spin transformation (1966) is the original real-space formulation of
the renormalization group: coarse-grain, rescale, and match — the prototype of all
refinement compatibility arguments.

## Key Claims

### The block-spin idea
Partition a lattice with spacing a into blocks of b^d sites (b = blocking factor).
Replace each block's spins by a single effective spin (majority rule or average).
Rescale distances: a → a·b, so the new lattice looks like the original.
The effective Hamiltonian H'(K') at the blocked scale relates to H(K) by a
renormalization transformation: K' = R(K).

### Connection to Wilson's framework (Remark 4.1)
Kadanoff's idea was the conceptual precursor to Wilson's RG (1971):
- Kadanoff (1966): the qualitative picture (block + rescale + effective couplings)
- Wilson (1971): the quantitative implementation (momentum shells, epsilon expansion)
Both realize: the continuum theory is not any finite lattice, but the fixed-point
structure of the blocking transformation.

### Universality
Different microscopic Hamiltonians flow to the same fixed point under blocking →
same critical exponents. This is universality: the continuum theory "forgets" the
microscopic details, keeping only the relevant operators.

### Connection to paper's themes
1. Block spins are literally "refinement in reverse": instead of refining from
   coarse to fine, you coarse-grain from fine to coarse and ask what's preserved.
2. The matching K' = R(K) is the real-space version of the counterterm subtraction
   of Section 2: you must specify how couplings change under scale change.
3. Fixed points of R are the "self-similar" theories of Remark 4.6.
