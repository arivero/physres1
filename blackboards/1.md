# Blackboard 1 — Self-adjoint extensions: the classification of point interactions

## Target
Remark 4.2 in delta-objects paper, after Example 4.1 (1D delta resolvent),
before Section 5.

## Core content

The 1D delta potential of Example 4.1 is the simplest case of a general
classification. The free Hamiltonian H₀ = -ℏ²/(2m) d²/dx² on ℝ^d, initially
defined on C_c^∞(ℝ^d\{0}), is symmetric but not self-adjoint when d ≤ 3.
Its self-adjoint extensions — the mathematically well-defined "point
interactions" — are classified by the deficiency indices and boundary
conditions at the origin [Albeverio et al. 2005]:

- **d=1**: one-parameter family indexed by the coupling g ∈ ℝ ∪ {∞}.
  The boundary condition is ψ'(0⁺) - ψ'(0⁻) = (2mg/ℏ²)ψ(0).
  g=0 is the free case; g=∞ gives Dirichlet at the origin.

> [REVIEWER] Correct. The deficiency indices are (1,1) and the one-parameter
> family is standard (Albeverio et al., Ch. I.1). Minor note: in d=1, the
> full four-parameter family of point interactions (including δ' interactions)
> requires the general 2×2 transfer matrix parameterization. The one-parameter
> family here is the subfamily with ψ continuous at the origin. If the paper
> only discusses the δ-type interaction, this restriction is fine, but it
> should be stated explicitly that we mean the δ subfamily, not the full
> (U(2)) family of generalized point interactions.

- **d=2**: one-parameter family, but now the parameter is a **scale** α > 0
  (dimensional transmutation). The coupling is logarithmically divergent
  and must be renormalized: g(Λ) ~ -2π/(m ln(Λ/α)), where Λ is the
  momentum cutoff. The physical parameter α has dimensions of inverse
  length (an energy scale). This is the prototype of dimensional transmutation
  in quantum field theory.

> [REVIEWER] Mostly correct; the dimensional transmutation story is right.
> Two points to tighten:
> (a) The sign and prefactor of g(Lambda) depend on the convention for the
> potential V = g delta^2(x). With the standard Jackiw (1991) convention
> (attractive for g < 0), the running coupling in 2D is
> 1/g(Lambda) = (m/2pi hbar^2) ln(Lambda/alpha). This inverts to
> g(Lambda) = 2pi hbar^2 / (m ln(Lambda/alpha)). The formula on the board
> has g(Lambda) ~ -2pi/(m ln(Lambda/alpha)), missing hbar^2 in the numerator.
> Check units: g should have dimensions of [energy][length^2] in 2D.
> (b) alpha has dimensions of inverse length (i.e., momentum), so it sets an
> energy scale via E_b = hbar^2 alpha^2 / (2m). Calling it "an energy scale"
> is loose but acceptable in a remark; just ensure the paper text is precise.

- **d=3**: one-parameter family indexed by the scattering length a ∈ ℝ ∪ {∞}.
  The coupling g(Λ) requires power-law renormalization: 1/g(Λ) = m/(2πℏ²a)
  - mΛ/(π²ℏ²). The scattering length a is the physical RG-invariant
  parameter.

> [REVIEWER] Correct in structure. The standard formula (Berezin-Faddeev,
> Albeverio Ch. I.5) can be written as
>   1/g(Lambda) = m/(2pi hbar^2) * (1/a - 2 Lambda/pi),
> which expands to m/(2pi hbar^2 a) - m Lambda/(pi^2 hbar^2). This matches
> what is written. The coefficient is consistent with a hard momentum cutoff
> regularization. Good.

- **d≥4**: no non-trivial self-adjoint extensions. The point is too thin
  relative to the Sobolev embedding: H¹(ℝ^d) ⊂ L^∞ only for d=1.
  For d ≥ 4, functions in the operator domain need not be continuous, so
  "evaluation at a point" is not a meaningful boundary condition.

> [REVIEWER] **ERROR in the Sobolev argument.** The conclusion (d>=4 has no
> extensions) is correct, but the reasoning via H^1 is wrong. Here is why:
>
> The Morrey embedding gives W^{k,p}(R^d) into C^0 when kp > d. For
> H^1 = W^{1,2}, this requires 2 > d, so H^1 embeds into L^infty only for
> d = 1. That statement on the board is correct *in isolation*. But it is
> the WRONG Sobolev space for this argument.
>
> The operator domain of the Laplacian is H^2 = W^{2,2}, not H^1. The
> relevant question is: can functions in H^2(R^d) be evaluated at a point?
> By Morrey, H^2 embeds into C^0 when 2*2 > d, i.e., d < 4, i.e., d <= 3.
> For d >= 4, H^2 functions need not be continuous, so removing a point from
> R^d does not change the closure of -Delta on C_c^infty(R^d\{0}).
>
> The correct statement: "H^2(R^d) embeds into C^0 only for d <= 3. For
> d >= 4, functions in the operator domain H^2 need not be continuous, so
> the point is invisible to the Laplacian."
>
> Using H^1 instead of H^2 would predict the threshold at d >= 2, which
> contradicts the existence of point interactions in d=2 and d=3. This is
> a significant error that must be fixed before promotion to the paper.
>
> Reference: Derezinski (arXiv:2403.17583) confirms: "-Delta on
> C_c^infty(R^d\{0}) is essentially self-adjoint for d >= 4."

## Connection to half-density scaling

The critical dimension d=4 threshold for non-existence of point interactions
connects to the ε^{-d/2} scaling of Section 2. The identity kernel's
near-diagonal scaling ε^{-d/2} controls whether the diagonal (coincident)
limit of the Green function is finite:
- d=1: G₀(0,0;E) ~ 1/κ, finite → well-defined rank-one perturbation theory
- d=2: G₀(0,0;E) ~ ln(Λ/κ), log-divergent → renormalization needed
- d=3: G₀(0,0;E) ~ Λ - κ, linearly divergent → renormalization needed
- d≥4: G₀(0,0;E) ~ Λ^{d-2}, power divergent → no self-adjoint extension

> [REVIEWER] These are all correct and well-presented. Let me verify each:
>
> d=1: G_0(x,x';E) = (m/hbar^2) * exp(i kappa |x-x'|) / (i kappa) where
> kappa = sqrt(2mE)/hbar. At coincidence, |G_0(0,0;E)| ~ 1/kappa. Finite.
> Correct.
>
> d=2: G_0 involves Hankel function H_0^(1)(kappa r). Near r=0,
> H_0^(1)(z) ~ (2i/pi) ln(z/2) + const. With a UV cutoff Lambda,
> the coincident limit gives ~ ln(Lambda/kappa). Correct.
>
> d=3: G_0(r;E) ~ exp(i kappa r)/(4 pi r). The coincident limit with a
> hard cutoff at |p| = Lambda gives integral ~ Lambda - (pi/2) kappa.
> Writing "~ Lambda - kappa" drops a numerical prefactor but the scaling
> is correct. Acceptable for a remark.
>
> d>=4: The free Green function in d dimensions behaves as r^{2-d} near
> the origin, so the regularized coincident limit with cutoff Lambda scales
> as Lambda^{d-2}. Correct.
>
> One small note: for d=3, the notation "Lambda - kappa" is slightly

> but do not present it as an exact equation.

The half-density ε^{-d/2} exponent controls the severity of the diagonal
singularity and thus the existence/non-existence of boundary data.

> [REVIEWER] The narrative connecting epsilon^{-d/2} to the Green function
> singularity is appealing but needs care. The Green function G_0(r;E)
> near the origin scales as r^{2-d} (for d >= 3), not as r^{-d/2}. The
> regularized coincident limit gives Lambda^{d-2}, not Lambda^{d/2}. So
> the connection to the "half-density" exponent d/2 is not as direct as
> suggested. The heat kernel K(t,x,x) ~ (4 pi t)^{-d/2} does carry the
> d/2 exponent, but the resolvent (Laplace transform of the heat kernel)

> behavior. The claim that epsilon^{-d/2} "controls" the threshold is
> therefore imprecise -- it is epsilon^{-(d-2)/2} (i.e., the resolvent

## Connection to RCP (open question 3)

The self-adjoint extension parameter (g, α, or a) is the "contact datum"
that must be preserved under changes of the regularization scheme. This
is a concrete instance of the RCP applied to point interactions:
- Different UV regulators (hard cutoff, dimensional regularization, zeta
  function) all flow to the same one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions
- The physical parameter (scattering length, transmutation scale) is the
  RG-invariant datum that survives all regularization schemes
- The universality of the contact datum C₀ (from the fermionic paper) is
  the same phenomenon: different UV completions give the same IR contact
  coefficient

This makes the connection to open question 3 (does contact-expansion
universality produce new constraints?) concrete: the self-adjoint extension
classification IS the constraint — it limits which contact data are consistent
with quantum mechanics.

## Proposed remark text (condensed for paper)

The one-parameter families are parameterized by:
(d=1) coupling g, (d=2) transmutation scale α, (d=3) scattering length a.
For d ≥ 4, no non-trivial self-adjoint extensions exist because H¹(ℝ^d)
functions need not be continuous — the point is too thin to support boundary
data. The diagonal singularity of the free Green function, controlled by the
ε^{-d/2} scaling of Section 2, determines whether the rank-one perturbation
of Example 4.1 can be defined: finite (d=1), log-divergent (d=2), linearly
divergent (d=3), or power-divergent with no remedy (d ≥ 4). In each admissible
dimension, the self-adjoint extension parameter is the RG-invariant contact
datum that survives all regularization schemes — a concrete instance of the
refinement-compatibility principle applied to point interactions.
