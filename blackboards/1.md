# WKB Approximation as a Refinement Limit
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S132

## Context
The uncuttable paper shows refinement limits in analysis (Section 2: integrals,
derivatives, Euler-Maclaurin) and dynamics (Section 3: path integrals, ordering,
Trotter splitting). The WKB approximation is a refinement limit in ℏ that bridges
both: the formal expansion Q(ℏ) = Q₀ + ℏQ₁ + ℏ²Q₂ + ... is a systematic
approximation family, and the connection formulas at turning points are the
"extra structure" that the naive local WKB solution cannot provide.

## Key claims

1. **WKB as ℏ-refinement.** The WKB ansatz ψ(x) = A(x) exp(iS(x)/ℏ) leads to
   a formal expansion of S in powers of ℏ: S = S₀ + ℏS₁ + ℏ²S₂ + ...
   At leading order (ℏ⁰), S₀ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (classical
   mechanics). Each higher order adds quantum corrections. This is a refinement
   family indexed by the number of terms retained.

2. **Connection formulas as "extra structure."** Near a classical turning point
   x₀ where V(x₀) = E, the WKB approximation breaks down (the amplitude
   A(x) ∝ 1/√p(x) diverges as p(x₀) → 0). The connection formula relates
   oscillatory solutions on one side to exponentially decaying/growing solutions
   on the other. This is NOT determined by the local WKB expansion — it requires
   solving the Airy equation near x₀ and matching. The connection formula is the
   "control data" that makes the global WKB solution well-defined.

3. **Bohr-Sommerfeld from single-valuedness.** For a bound state in a potential
   well with turning points a and b, the WKB wavefunction must be single-valued
   around the classical orbit. Applying the connection formula at both turning
   points gives the quantization condition:
   ∫_a^b p(x) dx = (n + ½)πℏ,  n = 0,1,2,...
   The ½ correction comes from the Maslov index (each turning point contributes
   π/2 phase). This is refinement compatibility: the quantization condition ensures
   the refinement limit (ℏ → 0 with n → ∞ holding nℏ fixed) produces a consistent
   semiclassical limit.

4. **Asymptotic nature of WKB.** The WKB series is generically DIVERGENT — it is
   an asymptotic expansion, not a convergent one. The first N terms give O(ℏ^N)
   accuracy, but the full series diverges. This parallels the perturbative
   expansion in QFT (loop expansion), which is also asymptotic. The "uncuttable"
   message: no finite truncation IS the answer; the answer is the limit procedure
   (Borel summation, resurgence, exact quantization conditions).

5. **Connection to Remark 3.5.** The connection formulas at turning points play
   the same structural role as the Berry phase at the adiabatic limit: both are
   geometric data (the Maslov index is a topological invariant) that no local
   approximant captures but the global solution requires. The Maslov correction
   ½ in the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition is the simplest instance of holonomy in
   the WKB context.

## Proposed remark for uncuttable satellite
Remark 3.6 (~3 lines) after Remark 3.5 (adiabatic/Berry). State WKB as an
ℏ-refinement limit, connection formulas at turning points as control data,
Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization from single-valuedness/Maslov index. Keep compact.

**Claim 1 (WKB ansatz and Hamilton-Jacobi): CORRECT WITH CAVEATS**

The description is accurate at the conceptual level. The WKB ansatz ψ = A(x)exp(iS(x)/ℏ)
with S = S₀ + ℏS₁ + ... is standard, and S₀ does satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
(S₀')² = 2m(E-V). Minor point: the amplitude A(x) also has an ℏ-expansion (not just S),
and the full expansion is better written as ψ = exp(i(S₀ + ℏS₁ + ...)/ℏ) where the
pre-exponential structure emerges from exponentiating the ℏS₁ term. The first-order
result A ∝ 1/√p emerges from the ℏ¹ transport equation 2S₀'S₁' + S₀'' = 0.

**Claim 2 (Connection formulas): CORRECT**

The amplitude A ∝ 1/√p(x) indeed diverges at turning points where p(x₀) = 0. The
connection formula cannot be derived from local WKB expansion—it requires solving
the Airy equation in a neighborhood of x₀ (where the linearized potential makes the
Schrödinger equation exactly solvable) and matching the WKB solutions on both sides
to the Airy solution. Standard texts (Landau-Lifshitz, Heading, Berry-Mount) all
emphasize this is "extra data." The control-theoretic framing is apt.

**Claim 3 (Bohr-Sommerfeld): CORRECT**

The quantization condition ∫ₐᵇ p dx = (n + ½)πℏ is the standard form for a 1D
potential well. The ½ comes from the Maslov index: for a closed orbit with 2 turning
points, μ = 2, and the general formula ∮ p·dq = 2πℏ(n + μ/4) gives
2∫ₐᵇ p dx = 2πℏ(n + ½). Each turning point contributes π/2 to the phase (the WKB
phase integral picks up -π/4 at each turning point from the Airy matching). This is
textbook semiclassical quantization.

**Claim 4 (Asymptotic divergence): CORRECT**

The WKB series is a canonical example of an asymptotic expansion. For generic
potentials, the coefficients Sₖ grow factorially, and the series diverges. This is
rigorously established in semiclassical analysis (Helffer-Sjöstrand, Martinez,
resurgence literature). The series is Borel-summable, and the non-perturbative
corrections (instantons, tunneling) are essential. The parallel to QFT loop expansions
is exact—both are Gevrey-1 asymptotic series with factorial growth tied to instanton
actions.

**Claim 5 (Maslov index and Berry phase): CORRECT WITH CAVEATS**

The structural parallel is valid: both are holonomies that cannot be captured by local
approximations. The Maslov index is a topological invariant counting caustics (or
conjugate points) along a Lagrangian path in phase space. The Berry phase is geometric
holonomy in adiabatic evolution. Both arise from parallel transport in different
fibrations (metaplectic structure vs. adiabatic connection). Pedagogically, the analogy
is useful—both are "global control data" for refinement limits. Caveat: Maslov is
fundamentally topological (integer index), Berry is geometric (continuous phase).
The connection via holonomy is the right unifying concept.

**Overall assessment:**

The blackboard note is mathematically sound. All key claims are correct, with minor
pedagogical refinements possible (clarify that A also expands in ℏ; distinguish
topological vs. geometric nature of Maslov vs. Berry). The framing of WKB as an
ℏ-refinement limit with connection formulas as control data is conceptually precise
and aligns well with the uncuttable paper's theme. The proposed Remark 3.6 is a natural
fit after the Berry phase discussion in Remark 3.5. Recommend proceeding with the
satellite remark as drafted.
