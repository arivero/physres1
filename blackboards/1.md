# Blackboard 1 — Stone-von Neumann theorem (Section 3, uncuttable)

## Target
Remark 3.8 in uncuttable paper, after Remark 3.7 (deformation quantization),
before Section 4.

## Core content

The Stone-von Neumann theorem (1931) addresses the UNIQUENESS of the
"refinement limit" for quantum mechanics:

Theorem: Any strongly continuous unitary representation of the Weyl
relations U(a)V(b) = e^{iab/ℏ} V(b)U(a) on a separable Hilbert space
is unitarily equivalent to the Schrödinger representation
(q̂ψ = xψ, p̂ψ = -iℏ ∂ψ/∂x).

Meaning for "uncuttable":
- Different "regularizations" (different Hilbert space realizations of
  the canonical commutation relations) all yield the same quantum theory
  (up to unitary equivalence).
- This is the UNIQUENESS theorem for the refinement limit: all roads
  lead to the same Schrödinger representation.

Connection to Example 3.1 (α-ordering):
- Different α-orderings produce different quantum Hamiltonians, but these
  are all operators on the SAME Hilbert space (the one guaranteed by
  Stone-von Neumann). The non-uniqueness is in the Hamiltonian, not
  in the representation of [q̂,p̂]=iℏ.

FAILURE for infinitely many degrees of freedom (QFT):
- Stone-von Neumann fails for infinite degrees of freedom: the Weyl
  algebra admits uncountably many inequivalent representations.
- This is Haag's theorem: the interaction picture does not exist in the
  usual sense because the free and interacting Hilbert spaces are
  unitarily inequivalent.
- The physical consequence: in QFT, the choice of "vacuum" (which
  representation) IS part of the theory. Different vacua → different
  physics (spontaneous symmetry breaking, theta vacua, etc.)
- Renormalization is the procedure that navigates this infinite-dimensional
  non-uniqueness: the counterterms of Section 2 and the RG flow of
  Section 4 are the control data needed because Stone-von Neumann
  no longer guarantees a unique destination.

The "uncuttable" message: for finitely many degrees of freedom, the
refinement limit exists and is unique (Stone-von Neumann). For infinitely
many, uniqueness fails, and EXTRA CONTROL DATA (renormalization conditions,
choice of vacuum, RG flow) becomes part of the definition — exactly
the pattern of Section 1's definition item 3.
