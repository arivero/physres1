# Gutzwiller Trace Formula: Semiclassical Spectral Connection
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S155

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 7 (Outlook), Remark 7.4 after Remark 7.3 (Ehrenfest time).
The paper discusses spectral statistics (Remark 7.2: Berry-Tabor for integrable → Poisson, BGS for chaotic → GOE/GUE) and the Ehrenfest time (Remark 7.3: logarithmic timescale for chaos). The Gutzwiller trace formula is the foundational result connecting quantum spectra to classical periodic orbits in non-integrable systems — it underlies both the spectral statistics and the semiclassical limit discussion.

## Key Claims

### Gutzwiller's trace formula (1971)
For a chaotic (non-integrable) system with Hamiltonian H, the density of states admits the semiclassical approximation:

  g(E) = Σ_n δ(E - E_n) ≈ ḡ(E) + Σ_γ A_γ cos(S_γ(E)/ℏ - μ_γ π/2)

where:
- ḡ(E) is the smooth (Weyl) density of states — the "Thomas-Fermi" part, proportional to phase-space volume
- The sum is over primitive periodic orbits γ (and their repetitions)
- S_γ(E) = ∮_γ p·dq is the action along orbit γ
- A_γ involves the period T_γ and the stability determinant det(M_γ - I), where M_γ is the monodromy matrix
- μ_γ is the Maslov index of orbit γ

### Connection to the paper's themes

1. **EBK generalization**: For integrable systems, the EBK quantization of Remark 6.3 gives exact eigenvalues from the action integrals on invariant tori. The Gutzwiller trace formula is the generalization to non-integrable systems, where invariant tori do not exist — periodic orbits replace them as the organizing structures. Each periodic orbit contributes an oscillatory term to the density of states, with the action playing the role of the EBK action integral.

2. **Spectral statistics bridge**: The Berry-Tabor result (Remark 7.2, Poisson statistics for integrable systems) follows from the EBK formula: the phases S_γ/ℏ on different tori are generically incommensurate. The GOE/GUE statistics for chaotic systems follow from the Gutzwiller formula combined with sum rules (Berry, 1985): the proliferating periodic orbits with exponentially growing number (Σ ~ e^{hT}/T, where h is the topological entropy) produce the specific pair correlations of random matrix theory.

3. **Maslov index again**: The Maslov index μ_γ in the trace formula is the same topological invariant as in Remark 6.3's EBK condition (μ_k/4 correction). In the periodic orbit context, it counts conjugate points along the orbit — places where nearby classical trajectories converge. This is the same "connection-formula control data" as in Remark 3.6's WKB discussion (in uncuttable paper).

4. **Amplitude and stability**: The amplitude A_γ ∝ T_γ/|det(M_γ - I)|^{1/2} diverges for marginally stable orbits (M_γ has eigenvalue 1) — these are the torus orbits of integrable systems. The trace formula thus degenerates to the EBK formula in the integrable limit, and the distinction between isolated periodic orbits (chaotic) and torus families (integrable) is the bifurcation point for the Poisson-to-GOE spectral transition.

### Limitations and extensions
- The sum over periodic orbits diverges for chaotic systems (proliferating orbits). Resummation techniques (cycle expansion, Selberg-type zeta functions) are needed.
- For mixed phase spaces (KAM systems), the trace formula interpolates between EBK (torus contributions) and Gutzwiller (isolated orbit contributions).
- In billiards, the periodic orbits are geometric (straight-line bounces), making the trace formula more concrete. The Selberg trace formula for surfaces of constant negative curvature is exact (not asymptotic).

## Proposed Remark
Remark 7.4 in action-angle Section 7, after Remark 7.3 (Ehrenfest time).
Content: Gutzwiller trace formula as the semiclassical spectral identity connecting eigenvalue density to classical periodic orbits. Generalizes EBK (Remark 6.3) to non-integrable systems: each periodic orbit γ contributes an oscillation with phase S_γ/ℏ and Maslov correction μ_γ, amplitude governed by the stability determinant. Underlies the spectral statistics of Remark 7.2: Berry-Tabor (Poisson) follows from incommensurate torus actions; BGS (random matrix) follows from the exponential proliferation of periodic orbits in chaotic systems.
