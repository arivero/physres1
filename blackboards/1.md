# OQ-dS-3: Spatial a₂=0 on S³ vs Conformal Anomaly on S⁴

## §1. Setup

Two Euclidean formulations of de Sitter QFT for the half-density scalar:

| Formulation | Manifold | Topology | a₂(Δ_{1/2}) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lagrangian (instanton) | \(S^4\) | compact, round | \(-1/15\) |
| Hamiltonian (spatial) | \(S^3\) | spatial section | \(0\) |

From the closed-form (BB4, THREE-AGENT):
\[a_2(\Delta_{1/2}; S^d) = -\frac{d(d-1)(d-3)}{180}\]

\(S^4\): \(d=4\), \(a_2 = -12/180 = -1/15\).
\(S^3\): \(d=3\), \(a_2 = 0\) (from the \((d-3)\) factor).

## §2. The Lagrangian Side: Conformal Anomaly on \(S^4\)

In even \(d\), the trace anomaly \(\langle T^a{}_a \rangle\) is determined by \(a_{d/2}\).

On \(S^4\) (\(d=4\)): the relevant coefficient is \(a_2(\Delta_{1/2}; S^4) = -1/15\).

**Conformal anomaly** (Capper-Duff 1974, Duff 1994):
\[\langle T^a{}_a \rangle = \frac{1}{(4\pi)^2}\left(c\,C_{abcd}C^{abcd} - a\,E_4 + b\,\Box R\right)\]

For a scalar with \(\xi = 1/6\) (the composition-forced value):
- \(c = 1/120\), \(a = 1/360\), \(b = 1/180\) (standard).
- On \(S^4\) (conformally flat: \(C_{abcd} = 0\), \(E_4 = 24/a^4\), \(\Box R = 0\)):
\[\langle T^a{}_a \rangle_{S^4} = -\frac{1}{360}\cdot\frac{24}{(4\pi)^2 a^4} = -\frac{1}{240\pi^2 a^4}\]

This is NONZERO. The half-density scalar has a nontrivial 4D conformal anomaly on \(S^4\).

## §3. The Hamiltonian Side: Spatial Heat Kernel on \(S^3\)

The spatial Hamiltonian is \(H_{1/2} = \Delta_{1/2}|_{S^3}\) (the half-density Laplacian on the \(d=3\) spatial section).

Heat kernel expansion on \(S^3\):
\[\mathrm{tr}\,e^{-tH_{1/2}} = (4\pi t)^{-3/2}\left[\mathrm{Vol}(S^3) + 0\cdot t + 0\cdot t^2 + O(t^3)\right]\]

**Both \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) vanish.** The leading curvature correction is \(O(t^3)\) from \(a_3\).

Consequences for the Hamiltonian formulation:
1. **Casimir energy** on \(S^3\): no \(O(R)\) or \(O(R^2)\) corrections. Leading curvature correction at \(O(R^3)\).
2. **Spectral counting**: eigenvalue density follows the flat-space Weyl law up to \(O(t^2)\) corrections.
3. **Thermal partition function** \(Z(\beta) = \mathrm{tr}\,e^{-\beta H_{1/2}}\): no curvature corrections at \(O(\beta)\) or \(O(\beta^2)\).

## §4. Product vs Round: Why These Are Different

Key geometric point: \(S^4 \neq S^3 \times S^1\).

\(S^4\) (round): constant sectional curvature \(K = 1/a^2\), \(R = 12/a^2\).
\(S^3 \times S^1_\beta\): product metric, \(R = R_{S^3} + R_{S^1} = 6/a^2 + 0\).

For a product manifold \(M_1 \times M_2\):
- Riemann tensor has no cross components: \(R_{i\alpha j\beta} = 0\).
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_1 \times M_2) = V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_1) + V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_2)\) (BB5 Thm C5.1).
- But \(a_2\) is NOT additive: cross terms \(\propto R_1 R_2\), \(R_1 V_2\), \(V_1 V_2\) appear.

**However**, for \(S^3 \times S^1\):
- \(R(S^1) = 0\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^1) = 0\), \(R_{abcd}(S^1) = 0\).
- ALL cross terms vanish (every cross term involves at least one factor of \(R_2\), \(V_2\), or \(R_{2,abcd}\)).
- Therefore: \(a_2(S^3 \times S^1) = a_2(S^3) + a_2(S^1) = 0 + 0 = 0\).

**Result:** The thermal product geometry \(S^3 \times S^1\) has \(a_2 = 0\) (no conformal anomaly), while the instanton geometry \(S^4\) has \(a_2 = -1/15\) (nontrivial anomaly).

## §5. Physical Interpretation

### 5.1. Two Vacua, Two Anomalies

| | Thermal (S³×S¹) | Instanton (S⁴) |
|---|---|---|
| Topology | Product | Round |
| \(d_{\mathrm{eff}}\) | 3+1 (factored) | 4 (unified) |
| \(a_2\) | 0 | \(-1/15\) |
| Conformal anomaly | ABSENT | PRESENT |
| de Sitter interpretation | Static patch thermal state | Hartle-Hawking no-boundary |

### 5.2. The Half-Density "Protection" Is Spatial

The vanishing \(a_2(S^3) = 0\) protects the SPATIAL quantum mechanics from curvature corrections. In the Hamiltonian picture:
- The vacuum energy on \(S^3\) receives no \(R\) or \(R^2\) curvature renormalization.
- The spatial spectrum of \(H_{1/2}\) is maximally insensitive to the S³ curvature.

But the FULL 4D path integral on \(S^4\) is not a product — the time direction is curved too. The 4D trace anomaly arises from the full \(S^4\) geometry, which has curvature in all four directions simultaneously. No factorization into spatial + temporal is possible.

### 5.3. ADM Decomposition Perspective

In the ADM split \(M^4 = \mathbb{R} \times S^3\) with lapse \(N\) and shift \(N^i\):
- The 4D action decomposes into spatial + temporal pieces.
- For static dS₄: \(N = (1-H^2r^2)^{1/2}\), nontrivial lapse.
- The 4D conformal anomaly involves curvature of the FULL 4D geometry, including lapse gradients.

The spatial \(a_2 = 0\) means: the SPATIAL contribution to the 4D anomaly is zero. The nonzero 4D anomaly comes entirely from the "mixing" of spatial curvature with the nontrivial lapse/temporal structure.

**Slogan:** "Composition protects the spatial vacuum; spacetime curvature reintroduces the anomaly."

## §6. Limiting Cases and Checks

### 6.1. Flat limit (\(H \to 0\), \(a \to \infty\))

\(S^4 \to \mathbb{R}^4\): \(a_2 \to 0\) (flat space, no anomaly). CHECK.
\(S^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3\): \(a_2 \to 0\) (already zero). CHECK.

### 6.2. \(D = 3\) de Sitter (spatial section \(S^2\))

\(a_2(S^2) = -2\cdot1\cdot(-1)/180 = 1/90 \neq 0\).
Spatial quantum mechanics on \(S^2\) DOES have \(R^2\) corrections. The spatial protection is absent for \(D \neq 4\). CHECK: consistent with D=4 specialness.

### 6.3. \(D = 5\) de Sitter (spatial section \(S^4\))

\(a_2(S^4) = -1/15 \neq 0\).
Spatial quantum mechanics on \(S^4\) has curvature corrections. Again, no protection for \(D \neq 4\). CHECK.

## §7. The Dimensional Coincidence

Why is spatial \(a_2 = 0\) unique to \(D = 4\)?

Spacetime dimension \(D\), spatial dimension \(d = D-1\):
\[a_2(\Delta_{1/2}; S^{D-1}) = -\frac{(D-1)(D-2)(D-4)}{180}\]

Vanishes iff \(D \in \{1, 2, 4\}\). Only \(D = 4\) is nontrivial.

This is the SAME \((d-3)\) factor as before (\(d = D-1\), so \(d-3 = D-4\)).

**Summary:** Among de Sitter spacetimes \(\mathrm{dS}_D\) for \(D \geq 3\):
- Only in \(D = 4\) does the half-density scalar on the spatial section have \(a_2 = 0\).
- Only in \(D = 4\) is the spatial vacuum maximally insensitive to curvature.
- The 4D conformal anomaly on the full \(S^4\) is nonzero, arising from the non-factorizable spacetime geometry.

## §8. Connection to the D=4 Coincidence Table

This gives a more refined version of coincidence (v):

| # | Coincidence | Type |
|---|---|---|
| (v-refined) | Spatial \(a_2(S^{D-1}) = 0\) iff \(D = 4\); spatial vacuum protected from \(R^2\) corrections | Heat kernel + ADM |
| (v-contrast) | Full \(a_2(S^D) \neq 0\) for \(d = D \geq 2\); 4D conformal anomaly survives | Lagrangian |

The protection is SPATIAL, not spacetime. Composition shields the Hamiltonian formulation but not the Lagrangian instanton path integral. This is physically sensible: composition is a property of TEMPORAL evolution (sewing propagators in time), hence it naturally constrains the SPATIAL operator.

## §9. Open Questions

**OQ-dS-3a.** On \(S^3 \times S^1_\beta\): the conformal anomaly vanishes for ALL \(\beta\) (not just \(\beta_{\mathrm{GH}}\)). Does this mean the half-density scalar is conformally anomaly-free in the thermal state of any static spacetime with \(S^3\) spatial sections?

**OQ-dS-3b.** For Schwarzschild-de Sitter (spatial section = \(S^2\) topology but not round): \(a_2(S^2_{\mathrm{SdS}}) \neq 0\) because \(a_2\) depends on local curvature, not just topology. But is the INTEGRATED \(A_2 = \int a_2\,\mathrm{dvol}\) nonzero?

**OQ-dS-3c.** Does the spatial protection extend to fermionic fields? For a Dirac fermion with half-density normalization, what is \(a_2(\Delta_{1/2}^{\mathrm{Dirac}}; S^3)\)?

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (physicist). Needs 2nd agent for review.**
