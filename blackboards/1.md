# Casimir Effect: Vacuum Forces from Boundary Conditions
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S148

## Context
Target: fermionic mediators paper, Section 5 (after Remark 5.6 on Feshbach resonances) or Section 6 (Outlook). The paper's arc: bosonic sourcing → fermionic obstruction → contact/boundary-condition replacement → point-interaction/SAE examples. The Casimir effect is a striking example where boundary conditions alone generate measurable forces — no classical source is needed. The force arises from how boundaries modify the vacuum fluctuation spectrum, and the calculation requires regularization of the zero-point energy sum.

## Key Claims

### The setup
Two perfectly conducting parallel plates separated by distance d in vacuum. The electromagnetic field satisfies Dirichlet (or more precisely, conducting) boundary conditions at the plates, restricting the allowed mode frequencies to a discrete set between the plates while leaving them continuous outside.

### The vacuum energy and the force
The zero-point energy of each mode is ℏω/2. The total vacuum energy is formally divergent:

  E(d) = (ℏ/2) Σ_n ω_n(d)

The physically meaningful quantity is the difference between the energy with plates at distance d and the energy with plates at infinity. This difference — after regularization (zeta function, exponential cutoff, or dimensional) — gives the Casimir energy per unit area:

  E_C/A = -π²ℏc/(720 d³)

The resulting attractive force per unit area is:

  F/A = -π²ℏc/(240 d⁴)

### Connection to the paper's themes

1. **Force from boundary conditions, not from sources**: No classical source J(x) is needed. The plates impose boundary conditions on the field modes, and the modified vacuum fluctuation spectrum generates a finite, measurable force. This is the boundary-condition/self-adjoint-extension paradigm of Section 5 producing an actual force.

2. **Regularization is essential**: The raw sum Σ ω_n diverges. The physical prediction requires a regularization scheme (zeta function: ζ(s) = Σ ω_n^{-s}, analytically continued to s = -1; or exponential cutoff with subtraction of the d-independent divergent terms). The finite result is independent of the regularization scheme — scheme independence paralleling Examples 5.1-5.2 where renormalized observables are cutoff-independent.

3. **Dimensional dependence**: In d spatial dimensions between plates, the Casimir energy density scales as d^{-(d+1)}. The numerical coefficient depends on dimension and boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic). This echoes Remark 5.4's dimensional dependence of contact interaction properties.

4. **Fermionic Casimir effect**: Fermionic fields (satisfying antiperiodic/bag boundary conditions) also produce Casimir forces, but with the opposite sign in certain configurations (repulsive). The thermal Casimir effect at temperature T introduces a crossover from quantum (d ≪ ℏc/T) to thermal (d ≫ ℏc/T) behavior. The fermionic contribution is a concrete instance of "fermions affect forces through loop/vacuum mechanisms" (Section 3).

### Experimental verification
- Lamoreaux (1997): first precision measurement with torsion pendulum, ~5% agreement
- Mohideen and Roy (1998): AFM measurement at submicron separations, ~1% precision
- Bressi et al. (2002): parallel-plate geometry (closest to Casimir's original setup)

### Spectral zeta function perspective
The zeta-function regularization ζ_H(s) = Σ λ_n^{-s} of the Laplacian with the given boundary conditions encodes all vacuum energy information. The Casimir energy is proportional to ζ_H(-1/2) (or a derivative thereof). This connects to the general spectral theory of self-adjoint extensions: different SAE parameters change the spectrum {λ_n} and hence the Casimir energy — making the extension datum physically measurable through the vacuum force.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 5.7, after Remark 5.6 (Feshbach resonances), before Section 6.

Content: The Casimir effect as a force generated purely by boundary conditions (no classical source). Conducting plates restrict the vacuum mode spectrum; the regulated difference of zero-point energies gives F/A = -π²ℏc/(240d⁴). Regularization scheme independence echoes the cutoff independence of Examples 5.1-5.2. The result is the boundary-condition paradigm of Section 5 producing a measurable macroscopic force.
