# Quantum State Tomography: Reconstructing Phase-Space Distributions
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S161

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 6 (after Remark 6.6 on Wigner function) or Section 5 (foundations).
The paper discusses the Husimi function (Remark 6.4) and Wigner function (Remark 6.6) as phase-space portraits. Quantum state tomography is the experimental method for reconstructing these distributions from measurement data — the inverse problem of phase-space characterization.

## Key Claims

### Optical homodyne tomography (Smithey et al., 1993)
The Wigner function W(x,p) is related to position probability distributions via the Radon transform:

  P_θ(s) = ∫ W(s cos θ - t sin θ, s sin θ + t cos θ) dt

where P_θ(s) is the probability distribution of the rotated quadrature X_θ = x cos θ + p sin θ at angle θ. Measuring P_θ(s) for all θ ∈ [0,π) and inverting the Radon transform (filtered back-projection) gives the Wigner function.

In quantum optics, different quadrature angles are accessed by homodyne detection: mixing the signal field with a local oscillator whose phase φ selects the measured quadrature. This was first demonstrated by Smithey, Beck, Raymer, and Faridani (1993), who reconstructed the Wigner function of a squeezed vacuum state.

### Connection to the paper's themes

1. **Operational meaning of phase-space portraits**: Remarks 6.4-6.6 present Husimi and Wigner functions as mathematical objects. Tomography shows they are also experimentally accessible — the ring (Fock state) vs blob (coherent state) distinction of Remark 6.4 can be directly measured.

2. **Action-angle reconstruction**: For an oscillator state, measuring the number distribution |⟨n|ψ⟩|² (photon counting) gives the "action" information (the radial profile of the Wigner function). The off-diagonal coherences — which determine the "angle" information — require the additional quadrature measurements of tomography.

3. **Uncertainty relation in practice**: Proposition 4.2's circular uncertainty relation ΔL_z² · (1-R²) ≥ ℏ²R²/4 can in principle be tested by measuring R (the circular concentration of the phase distribution) and ΔL_z from the marginals.

### Informationally complete measurements
Full tomographic reconstruction requires an informationally complete set of measurements. For a d-dimensional system, the density matrix ρ has d²-1 real parameters (normalization and hermiticity reduce d² complex entries). The rotated quadrature measurements for all θ provide continuous oversampling — more than enough information for reconstruction.

## Proposed Remark
Remark 5.4 or Remark 6.x in action-angle paper.
Content: Quantum state tomography via the Radon transform of the Wigner function. Rotated quadrature measurements P_θ(s) for all θ reconstruct the full phase-space portrait. First demonstrated for squeezed vacuum (Smithey et al., 1993). Makes the ring-vs-blob distinction of Remarks 6.4-6.6 experimentally accessible: Fock states show uniform phase (ring), coherent states show peaked phase (blob), directly observed in homodyne tomograms.
