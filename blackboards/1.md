# Monodromy and Bohr-Sommerfeld
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S169

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 6 (after Remark 6.3 on EBK quantization, or
Section 7 outlook). The paper discusses EBK quantization (Remark 6.3) and geometric
quantization (Remark 7.5). Monodromy — the obstruction to globally defining action-
angle coordinates — is a natural bridge: it explains why the naive Bohr-Sommerfeld
quantization fails for certain integrable systems (e.g., systems with focus-focus
singularities like the spherical pendulum or champagne bottle).

## Key Claims

### Hamiltonian monodromy (Duistermaat 1980)
For a completely integrable system with d degrees of freedom, the regular fibers
(invariant tori) form a torus bundle over the set of regular values of the energy-
momentum map. If this bundle is non-trivial (the action-angle coordinates cannot
be globally defined), the system has Hamiltonian monodromy: transporting action
variables around a loop in the space of regular values returns them by a non-trivial
GL(d,Z) transformation.

### Quantum monodromy
The quantum spectrum of a system with monodromy cannot be globally labeled by a
regular lattice of quantum numbers. The joint spectrum (E, L) of the spherical
pendulum, for example, shows a defect: the lattice has a "missing line" around which
quantum numbers undergo a GL(2,Z) transformation matching the classical monodromy.

### Connection to paper's themes
1. Monodromy shows that "action-angle indeterminacy" has a topological component:
   the action variables themselves may not be globally defined
2. This extends the local Fourier tradeoff of Section 4 to a global obstruction
3. The "extra data" needed to define the quantum spectrum (choice of local action
   coordinates) parallels the "control data" of the uncuttable companion

## Proposed Remark
Remark 6.10 in action-angle paper (after Bargmann, before Section 7).
