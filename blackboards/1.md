# Spectral Dimension from Modified Heat Kernels

## §1. Definition

Spectral dimension:
\[
d_s(t) := -2\,\frac{d\ln P(t)}{d\ln t},
\qquad
P(t) = \int \frac{d^dp}{(2\pi)^d}\,e^{t\phi(p)}.
\]
For \(P(t)\sim t^{-\alpha}\): \(d_s = 2\alpha\).

## §2. Standard case

\(\phi(p) = -c|p|^2\), \(c = \hbar/(2m)\).
\[
P(t) = (4\pi ct)^{-d/2}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad d_s = d.
\]

## §3. Quartic UV modification

\(\phi(p) = -c|p|^2(1 + |p|^2/\Lambda^2)\), \(\Lambda \sim 1/L_P\).

**IR** (\(t \gg m L_P^2/\hbar\)): \(d_s = d\).

**UV** (\(t \ll m L_P^2/\hbar\)): quartic dominates,
\[
P(t) \approx \int \frac{d^dp}{(2\pi)^d}\,e^{-ct|p|^4/\Lambda^2}
\sim (ct/\Lambda^2)^{-d/4}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad d_s = d/2.
\]

At \(d=4\): \(d_s\) flows \(4 \to 2\) (IR \(\to\) UV).

## §4. General Lifshitz dispersion

\(\phi(p) = -c_z|p|^{2z}\):
\[
P(t) \sim t^{-d/(2z)}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad d_s = d/z.
\]
\(z=1\): standard. \(z=2\): Horava-Lifshitz (\(d_s=d/2\)).

## §5. Dimensional analysis: \(L_P\) unlocks \(\alpha\neq2\)

d/2 uniqueness (Part 6): \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only forces \(\alpha=2\).

With \(\{m,\hbar,L_P\}\):
\[
c_\alpha \sim m^a\hbar^b L_P^c:
\quad
a+b=0,\; 2b+c=\alpha,\; b=1
\quad\Rightarrow\quad c=\alpha-2.
\]

| \(\alpha\) | \(c\) | \(c_\alpha\) | Dispersion | \(d_s\) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 0 | \(\hbar/m\) | Quadratic (standard) | \(d\) |
| 4 | 2 | \(\hbar L_P^2/m\) | Quartic (Lifshitz \(z=2\)) | \(d/2\) |
| 6 | 4 | \(\hbar L_P^4/m\) | Sextic (\(z=3\)) | \(d/3\) |

\(L_P\) as third constant breaks the \(\alpha=2\) uniqueness.

## §6. Connection to Carlip (2017)

Carlip (arXiv:1705.05417): \(d_s\to 2\) in UV across CDT, asymptotic safety, LQG, Horava-Lifshitz.

All introduce \(L_P\) (or gravitational scale). Our analysis:
\(d_s=d/2\) requires \(\alpha=4\), which requires \(c=2\) powers of \(L_P\).
No \(L_P\) \(\Rightarrow\) no quartic modification \(\Rightarrow\) \(d_s = d\) (always).

## §7. Crossover scale

\[
t_* \sim \frac{m L_P^2}{\hbar}.
\]
For \(m \ll M_P\): \(t_* \ll t_P\). Crossover is trans-Planckian.

## §8. Composition interpretation

d/2 uniqueness: composition + \(\{m,\hbar\}\) \(\Rightarrow\) quadratic.
Composition + \(\{m,\hbar,L_P\}\) allows:
\[
\phi(p) = -\frac{\hbar}{m}\sum_{n=1}^N \gamma_n L_P^{2(n-1)}|p|^{2n}.
\]
Semigroup (M1) satisfied. Mass conservation (M2) satisfied (\(\phi(0)=0\)).
The spectral dimension flow \(d \to d/2\) is CONSISTENT with composition + Planck scale.

## §9. Assessment of anomaly entry

| Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| \(d/2 = d_s(\text{UV})\) at \(d=4\) | TRUE (quartic Lifshitz) |
| Composition forces \(d_s = d/2\) at UV | FALSE (requires \(L_P\)) |
| Coincidence \(d/2 = 2 = d_s(\text{UV})\) is deep | DIMENSIONAL (\(d/(2z) = d/2\) for all \(d\)) |
| CDT/AS/LQG connection | CONSISTENT (all need \(L_P\)) |

**Corrected framing:** \(d_s \to d/2\) in UV is NOT forced by composition alone.
It requires \(L_P\) (third constant) unlocking quartic dispersion.
The coincidence at \(d=4\) is \(d/(2\cdot2) = 2\), holding for all \(d\).

**SINGLE-AGENT (mathematician).** Needs physicist: physical reality of \(z=2\) Lifshitz in QG.

## §10. Physicist Second-Agent Review (2026-02-21)

<!-- Physicist: -->

**P10.1 Mathematical analysis: CORRECT throughout.**
All dimensional matching, scaling limits, and Lifshitz classification verified.
The key identity \(c = \alpha - 2\) (powers of \(L_P\)) is clean and correct.

**P10.2 Physical reality of \(z=2\) Lifshitz in QG:**

| QG approach | \(z\) value | \(d_s\) UV | Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Horava-Lifshitz gravity | \(z=2\) (by construction) | 2 at \(d=4\) | Anisotropic scaling \(t\to b^z t\), \(x\to bx\) | Viable but problems (Lorentz violation, extra mode) |
| CDT (causal dynamical triangulations) | \(z\approx 2\) (measured) | \(\approx 2\) at \(d=4\) | Lattice simulations, causality constraint | Robust numerical result |
| Asymptotic Safety | \(z\) effective \(\sim 2\) (measured) | \(\approx 2\) | Non-Gaussian fixed point modifies propagator | Scheme-dependent; evidence from functional RG |
| LQG (loop quantum gravity) | Not directly \(z=2\) | \(\approx 2\) | Polymer quantization modifies dispersion | Different mechanism; same endpoint |

**P10.3 Physics assessment of each claim:**

(a) **\(d_s\to 2\) in UV across QG approaches (Carlip 2017):** This is a robust numerical/analytical observation. Carlip's point is that the convergence to \(d_s=2\) is INDEPENDENT of the specific QG approach, suggesting it's a generic feature of quantum spacetime. PHYSICS VERDICT: TRUE (well-established).

(b) **Composition forces \(d_s=d/2\):** CORRECTLY identified as FALSE. The \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only uniqueness theorem forces standard QM (\(\alpha=2\), \(d_s=d\)). The flow to \(d_s=d/2\) requires gravity (\(L_P\)), which composition alone does not provide. PHYSICS VERDICT: CORRECT assessment.

(c) **Coincidence \(d/2=2\) at \(d=4\) is dimensional:** CORRECT. The equation \(d_s = d/z\) gives \(d_s=d/2\) for \(z=2\), which holds for any \(d\). At \(d=4\) this gives 2, but there's no deep \(d=4\)-specific mechanism.

**P10.4 One physics subtlety the mathematician should note:**

The Horava-Lifshitz case is special: the z=2 scaling is a UV fixed point of the RG flow, not a postulate. The running \(z(k)\) flows from z=2 (UV) to z=1 (IR). This means the effective dispersion relation is:
\[
\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + \frac{c^2}{\Lambda^2}k^4 + \cdots
\]
The quartic term dominates at \(k\gg\Lambda\), giving \(z=2\). But crucially, Lorentz invariance (z=1) is recovered in the IR. This is a concrete realization of the polynomial in §8 of the BB.

**For CDT/AS:** The mechanism is different — the effective propagator acquires a modified high-momentum behavior from quantum corrections (running Newton's constant or effective metric fluctuations), not from an explicit quartic kinetic term. The result \(d_s\to 2\) is robust but the "dispersion relation" interpretation is approximate.

**P10.5 Connection to the project:**

This analysis clarifies what the d/2 uniqueness theorem DOES and DOES NOT say:
- It DOES force standard QM from \(\{m,\hbar\}\) alone (the paper's P4.2).
- It does NOT force UV spectral-dimension reduction (that requires gravity/\(L_P\)).
- The paper's thesis is STRENGTHENED by this distinction: composition forces ℏ without needing gravity. Gravity enters as a separate channel (not composition-forced).

**P10.6 Verdict:**

CONCUR with all mathematician assessments. Analysis is clean, physically grounded, and correctly scoped. The result is NOT promotable to the paper (it's an anomaly investigation, not a paper result), but it's valuable as a notebook entry clarifying the scope of d/2 uniqueness.

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT** (mathematician + physicist). Assessment CONFIRMED. Notebook-ready (scope clarification).

## §11. Critic Third-Agent Review (2026-02-21)

<!-- Critic: -->

**C11.1 Dimensional analysis (§5):** VERIFIED independently.
\([c_\alpha] = L^\alpha T^{-1}\). From \(m^a \hbar^b L_P^c\): \(M^{a+b} L^{2b+c} T^{-b}\).
Match: \(a+b=0\), \(2b+c=\alpha\), \(b=1\). So \(c=\alpha-2\).
At \(\alpha=4\): \(c=2\), hence \(c_4 = \hbar L_P^2/m\). CORRECT.

**C11.2 Spectral dimension formula (§§3-4):** CORRECT.
\(P(t) \sim t^{-d/(2z)}\) gives \(d_s = d/z\). At \(z=2\): \(d_s = d/2\).
At \(d=4\): \(d_s = 2\). CORRECT.

**C11.3 Key claim assessment:**

| Claim | Critic verdict |
|---|---|
| \(d_s \to d/2\) requires \(L_P\) | CORRECT. The d/2 uniqueness theorem (M4: \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only) forces \(\alpha=2\), hence \(d_s=d\). No UV reduction without third constant. |
| Coincidence at \(d=4\) is dimensional | CORRECT. \(d/(2z) = d/2\) holds for all \(d\). No \(d=4\) specificity. |
| Composition + \(\{m,\hbar,L_P\}\) admits quartic | CORRECT but IMPORTANT: this does NOT mean composition forces \(z=2\). It means composition is COMPATIBLE with quartic if \(L_P\) is available. |

**C11.4 Overclaim risk assessment:**

Sev-2: The BB could be misread as saying "composition + Planck length forces spectral dimension reduction." It does NOT. It says the d/2 uniqueness theorem has a SCOPE BOUNDARY at \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only, and adding \(L_P\) opens new branches. The physicist's P10.5 correctly frames this: "composition forces hbar WITHOUT needing gravity."

**C11.5 Promotion recommendation:**

Notebook entry: YES. Clarifies scope of d/2 uniqueness.
Paper promotion: NO. This is a scope analysis, not a new paper result.
The anomalies.md entry should be updated to reflect the corrected framing.

**STATUS: THREE-AGENT** (mathematician + physicist + critic). Notebook-ready. Not paper-promotable.

## §12. Computationalist Fourth-Agent Verification (2026-02-21)

<!-- Computationalist: -->

**C12.1 Numeric verification (scipy):** MDR $\omega=p^2+p^4/\Lambda^2$, $d=2,3,4,5,6$:

| $d$ | $d_s$ at $t=0.001$ | Expected $d/2$ | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 1.018 | 1.0 | $\checkmark$ |
| 3 | 1.523 | 1.5 | $\checkmark$ |
| 4 | 2.028 | 2.0 | $\checkmark$ |
| 5 | 2.532 | 2.5 | $\checkmark$ |
| 6 | 3.036 | 3.0 | $\checkmark$ |

All converge to $d/2$ as $t\to 0$. VERIFIED.

**C12.2 S² ordering comparison:** Heat trace on $S^2$:
- Laplace-Beltrami (spectrum $l(l+1)$): $d_s\to 2$ at small $t$. CORRECT.
- Left-ordered (spectrum $(l+1)^2$): $d_s > 2$ at all $t$ (ground state $\neq 0$). Ordering DOES affect spectral dimension.

**C12.3 Horava (z=d):** $d_s\to 1$ (spatial) at small $t$ for all $d$. VERIFIED numerically.

**C12.4 Concur** with mathematician §9 and critic C11.3-C11.4: the coincidence $d/2=2$ at $d=4$ is dimensional ($z=2$), NOT $d=4$-specific. CORRECT.

**STATUS: FOUR-AGENT** (mathematician + physicist + critic + computationalist). UNANIMOUS.
