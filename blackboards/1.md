# Schwinger Pair Production: Non-Perturbative Vacuum Force
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S153

## Context
Target: fermionic mediators paper, Section 3.1 (after Example 3.2 on Uehling potential) or Section 6 (Outlook). The paper discusses vacuum polarization as the loop-level mechanism by which fermions affect forces. Schwinger pair production is the non-perturbative counterpart: in a strong electric field, the vacuum becomes unstable against spontaneous creation of electron-positron pairs, producing a non-perturbative imaginary part of the effective action.

## Key Claims

### Schwinger's result (1951)
In a constant electric field E, the probability per unit volume per unit time for pair creation is:

  Γ/V = (αE²)/(π²) Σ_{n=1}^∞ (1/n²) exp(-nπm²c³/(eℏE))

The leading term (n=1) gives:

  Γ/V ∝ E² exp(-πm²c³/(eℏE)) = E² exp(-E_cr/E)

where E_cr = m²c³/(eℏ) ≈ 1.3 × 10¹⁸ V/m is the Schwinger critical field. The exponential suppression makes this unobservable in laboratory conditions for QED, but the mechanism is generic for any charged fermion.

### Connection to the paper's themes

1. **Non-perturbative vacuum effect**: Schwinger pair production is invisible to all orders of perturbation theory — the rate is ∝ exp(-const/α), which has a vanishing Taylor expansion in α. This complements the perturbative vacuum polarization of Section 3.1: fermions affect physics both perturbatively (running coupling, Uehling potential) and non-perturbatively (pair creation in strong fields).

2. **Imaginary part of the effective action**: The pair-creation rate is related to the imaginary part of the one-loop effective Lagrangian via Im(L_eff) ∝ Γ/V. The real part gives the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian — the effective nonlinear interaction of electromagnetic fields mediated by the virtual fermion loop:

  L_EH = L_Maxwell + (2α²/45m⁴)[(E²-B²)² + 7(E·B)²] + ...

This is a concrete example of "fermions affect forces through loop mechanisms" (Section 3): the electron loop generates effective photon-photon interactions that are absent in classical Maxwell theory.

3. **Connection to contact interactions**: At energies E ≪ m, the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian reduces to local operators — dimension-8 contact terms in the electromagnetic field. This is the QFT version of the contact expansion of Section 4: integrating out heavy fermions produces a tower of local operators organized by mass dimension.

4. **Tunneling interpretation**: The Schwinger formula can be derived by WKB tunneling through the mass gap — the electron must "tunnel" from the negative energy sea to positive energies across a gap 2mc² in the presence of the field. The tunneling probability ∝ exp(-πm²c³/(eℏE)) has the standard WKB form exp(-action/ℏ), with the action being the "bounce" in imaginary time.

### Experimental status
- Not yet directly observed in QED (E_cr ~ 10¹⁸ V/m is far beyond laboratory capabilities)
- Analogous processes observed in: Hawking radiation (gravitational analog), Unruh effect (acceleration analog), heavy-ion collisions (strong QCD fields)
- Proposed experimental approaches: intense laser facilities (ELI, XCELS)

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 3.3, after Example 3.2 (Uehling potential), before Section 4.

Content: Schwinger pair production as the non-perturbative counterpart of vacuum polarization. Rate ∝ E² exp(-E_cr/E), invisible to perturbation theory. The real part of the effective action gives the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian — dimension-8 local operators in E, B — the QFT version of Section 4's contact expansion. Fermions affect forces both perturbatively (Section 3.1) and non-perturbatively (pair creation).
