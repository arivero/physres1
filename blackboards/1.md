# RG Fundamental: Mathematical Verification (Pre-Vote)

## 1. Core Mathematical Claims

### 1.1 Loop Integral I₂(E;Λ) (RG-D1.1)

**Claim:** I₂(E;Λ) = -m/(2πℏ²)·[ln(Λ²/k²)+iπ] + O(k²/Λ²)

With E = ℏ²k²/(2m):

I₂(E;Λ) = ∫₀^Λ q dq/(2π) · 1/(E - ℏ²q²/(2m) + i0)
         = m/(πℏ²) ∫₀^Λ q dq/(k²-q²+i0)

Using partial fractions (or direct integration):
∫₀^Λ q dq/(k²-q²) = -½ ln|k²-q²|]₀^Λ
= -½[ln|k²-Λ²| - ln k²]
= -½ ln(Λ²/k²) + ½ ln|1-k²/Λ²|
≈ -½ ln(Λ²/k²) for Λ≫k

For the i0 prescription, the on-shell imaginary part:
1/(k²-q²+i0) → PV/(k²-q²) - iπδ(k²-q²)

∫₀^Λ q dq · (-iπδ(k²-q²)) = -iπ · q/(2q)|_{q=k} = -iπ/2

So I₂ = m/(πℏ²) · [-½ ln(Λ²/k²) - iπ/2]
       = -m/(2πℏ²)[ln(Λ²/k²) + iπ] ✓

**V1.1 VERIFIED.** ✓

**V1.2 FLAG (sev-3):** Paper writes I(E;Λ) with ∫ d²q/(2π)² = (1/(2π))∫₀^Λ q dq.
The factor of 1/(2π) from the angular integration gives the correct (1/2π)·m/(ℏ²)
overall prefactor. ✓ Convention consistent with standard 2D result.

### 1.2 Beta Function β(g_R) (RG-D1.2)

**Claim:** μ·d/dμ(1/g_R(μ)) = -m/(πℏ²), equivalently β(g_R) = (m/πℏ²)g_R²

From the renormalization condition:
1/g_R(μ) = 1/g_B(Λ) + (m/2πℏ²)ln(Λ²/μ²)

d/d(lnμ): d(1/g_R)/d(lnμ) = (m/2πℏ²)·(-2) = -m/(πℏ²). ✓

β(g_R) = -g_R² · d(1/g_R)/d(lnμ) = (m/πℏ²)g_R². ✓

**Note:** The paper states μ·d(1/g_R)/dμ = -m/(πℏ²). Let me verify sign/factor:
d/d(lnμ) = μ·d/dμ. From 1/g_R = 1/g_B + (m/2πℏ²)ln(Λ²/μ²):
μ·d/dμ(1/g_R) = (m/2πℏ²)·(-2) = -m/(πℏ²). ✓ (matches paper)

**V1.3 VERIFIED.** ✓

### 1.3 RG-Invariant Scale κ* (Proposition RG-P1.2)

**Claim:** κ*² = μ² exp(2πℏ²/(m·g_R(μ))) is μ-independent.

d(ln κ*²)/d(lnμ) = 2 + (2πℏ²/m)·d(1/g_R)/d(lnμ)
= 2 + (2πℏ²/m)·(-m/(πℏ²))
= 2 - 2 = 0. ✓

**V1.4 VERIFIED.** ✓

**V1.5 FLAG (sev-3):** Paper writes κ*² = μ² exp(2πℏ²/(m/g_R(μ)))...
Actually in §5.3: "κ*² ≡ μ² exp((2πℏ²/m)·(1/g_R(μ)))".
With μ·d(1/g_R)/dμ = -m/(πℏ²):

d(ln κ*²)/d(lnμ) = 2 + (2πℏ²/m)·(-m/(πℏ²)) = 2-2 = 0. ✓

**V1.6 CHECK on sign in T(E):**
Paper writes T(E) = (2πℏ²/m) / (ln(κ*²/k²) + iπ). Verify:

From T(E)⁻¹ = 1/g_R(μ) - (m/2πℏ²)ln(k²/μ²) + i(m/2ℏ²):
= (m/2πℏ²)[ln(μ²/κ*²) + ln(μ²/k²)... no.

Actually: 1/g_R(μ) = -(m/2πℏ²)ln(μ²/κ*²) [from definition of κ*].
So T(E)⁻¹ = -(m/2πℏ²)ln(μ²/κ*²) - (m/2πℏ²)ln(k²/μ²) + i(m/2ℏ²)
= (m/2πℏ²)[-ln(μ²/κ*²) - ln(k²/μ²)] + i(m/2ℏ²)
= (m/2πℏ²)·ln(κ*²/k²) + i(m/2ℏ²)
= (m/2πℏ²)[ln(κ*²/k²) + iπ]

So T(E) = (2πℏ²/m) / (ln(κ*²/k²) + iπ). ✓ (matches paper)

**V1.7 VERIFIED.** ✓

### 1.4 Wilsonian Shell Integration (RG-D1.2a)

**Claim:** Semigroup property W_{Λ→Λ₂} ∘ W_{Λ→Λ₁} = W_{Λ→Λ₂}.

From the RG map: 1/g_eff(Λ') = 1/g_B(Λ) + (m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ')

Composing: 1/g_eff(Λ₂) = 1/g_eff(Λ₁) + (m/πℏ²)ln(Λ₁/Λ₂)
= [1/g_B(Λ) + (m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ₁)] + (m/πℏ²)ln(Λ₁/Λ₂)
= 1/g_B(Λ) + (m/πℏ²)[ln(Λ/Λ₁)+ln(Λ₁/Λ₂)]
= 1/g_B(Λ) + (m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ₂)
= W_{Λ→Λ₂}(g_B). ✓

**V1.8 VERIFIED.** Semigroup property holds by additivity of logarithms. ✓

**V1.9 FLAG (sev-3):** Paper writes I_shell at threshold (E=0):
I_shell(0;Λ',Λ) = ∫_{Λ'}^Λ q dq/(2π) · 1/(0-ℏ²q²/(2m)+i0)
= ∫_{Λ'}^Λ q dq/(2π) · (-2m/(ℏ²q²))
= -(m/πℏ²) ∫_{Λ'}^Λ dq/q = -(m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ'). ✓

But paper has I_shell = -(m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ') — missing the 1/(2π) factor from angular integral?

Actually: ∫ d²q/(2π)² = ∫₀^∞ q dq/(2π) (after angular integration gives factor 2π).
So shell integral = ∫_{Λ'}^Λ q dq/(2π) · (-2m/(ℏ²q²)) = -(m/(πℏ²))∫_{Λ'}^Λ dq/q
= -(m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ'). ✓ Paper correct.

### 1.5 Schur Complement (RG-D1.7)

**Claim:** Integrating out y in S(x,y) = ½(ax² + 2bxy + cy²) gives
S_eff(x) = ½(a-b²/c)x² + (ℏ/2)ln c + const.

Gaussian: ∫ dy exp(-S(x,y)/ℏ) = exp(-½ax²/ℏ) · ∫ dy exp(-c/(2ℏ)(y+bx/c)²)
= exp(-½ax²/ℏ) · √(2πℏ/c)
= √(2πℏ/c) · exp(-a/(2ℏ)x² + b²/(2cℏ)x²)
= √(2πℏ/c) · exp(-(a-b²/c)/(2ℏ)x²)

So S_eff(x) = ½(a-b²/c)x² - ℏ·½·ln(2πℏ/c) + const.
= ½(a-b²/c)x² + ½ℏ·ln c + const (absorbing 2π into const). ✓

**V1.10 VERIFIED.** ✓

### 1.6 1D Contact Interaction: T-matrix and Fixed Points

**V1.11:** t(k) = 1/(1+iκ/k), r(k) = (-iκ/k)/(1+iκ/k) where κ = mg/ℏ².

From continuity: 1+r = t, ψ'(0⁺)-ψ'(0⁻) = (2mg/ℏ²)(1+r)
ik - ik·r - ik·t... let me use standard result:
Scattering conditions: t = ik/(ik+κ) = 1/(1+iκ/k). ✓
r = -iκ/k/(1+iκ/k) ← matches paper. Wait:
r = -κ/(ik+κ) = iκ/k/(iκ/k-1)·... let me redo.

From matching: 1+r = t and ik(1-r) - ikt = (2mg/ℏ²)t
→ ik(1-r-t) = (2mg/ℏ²)t
With 1+r=t: 1-r-t = 1-(1+r)-t+1...

Actually: ik(1-r) = ikt + (2mg/ℏ²)t... wait that's wrong direction.
ψ'(0+)-ψ'(0-) = 2g·m/ℏ²·ψ(0):
RHS: ikt - ik(1-r) = ikt - ik + ikr = (2mg/ℏ²)t
→ ikt - ik + ikr = (2mg/ℏ²)t
With 1+r=t: r=t-1, so: ikt - ik + ik(t-1) = (2mg/ℏ²)t
→ 2ikt - 2ik = (2mg/ℏ²)t
→ 2ik(t-1) = (2mg/ℏ²)t
→ t = ik/(ik-mg/ℏ²) = 1/(1+iκ/k)... wait sign:
= ik·ℏ²/(ik·ℏ²-mg) = 1/(1-mg/(ikℏ²)) = 1/(1+κ/(ik)) = 1/(1+i·iκ/k)...

Actually κ=mg/ℏ²: t = ik/(ik-κ)... no.

Let me be more careful. Derivative jump: ψ'(0+)-ψ'(0-)=(2mg/ℏ²)ψ(0).
ψ(x<0) = e^{ikx}+r e^{-ikx}, ψ'(0-) = ik-ikr.
ψ(x>0) = t e^{ikx}, ψ'(0+) = ikt.
Continuity: 1+r=t. Jump: ikt-(ik-ikr) = (2mg/ℏ²)(1+r).
→ ikt - ik + ikr = (2mg/ℏ²)t = (2κ)t (using κ=mg/ℏ²)
→ ikt - ik + ik(t-1) = 2κt [since r=t-1]
→ 2ikt - 2ik = 2κt
→ t(ik-κ) = ik → t = ik/(ik-κ)

Paper: t = 1/(1+iκ/k). Check: 1/(1+iκ/k) = k/(k+iκ) = ik/(ik-κ)·(-1)/(-1)...
= ik/(ik+κ)·1... no. k/(k+iκ) = k/(k+iκ)·(k-iκ)/(k-iκ) = k(k-iκ)/(k²+κ²). Hmm.

The issue: ik/(ik-κ) = ik/((ik-κ))·(-1)/(-1) = -ik/(κ-ik) = ik/(ik-κ).

Let me simplify: ik/(ik-κ) = 1/(1-κ/(ik)) = 1/(1+iκ/k). ✓ (since κ/(ik)=-iκ/k)

So t = 1/(1+iκ/k). ✓ matches paper.
r = t-1 = 1/(1+iκ/k) - 1 = -iκ/k/(1+iκ/k). ✓

**V1.11 VERIFIED.** ✓

## 2. Structure Assessment

**V2.1 VERIFIED:** Proposition RG-P1.1 (semigroup property) is standard.
W_{κ→μ}∘W_{Λ→κ} = W_{Λ→μ} is the defining semigroup axiom; the paper presents
it as a DEFINING property of the RG, which is the correct foundational framing. ✓

**V2.2 VERIFIED:** The calculus micro-model (§3) is a sound analogy.
D_ε f(x) = f(x+ε)/ε, counterterm = f(x)/ε, renormalized = (f(x+ε)-f(x))/ε → f'(x). ✓

**V2.3 FLAG (sev-3):** RG-D1.2a (Wilsonian) has a factor discrepancy in the presented formula.
Paper states I_shell(E;Λ',Λ) = ∫_{Λ'}^Λ q dq/(2π) / (E-ℏ²q²/(2m)).
At E=0: integral = -(m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ') ✓ (verified above).
But then says the RG map is:
1/g_eff(Λ') = 1/g_B(Λ) + (m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ')

Comparing with §5.2: 1/g_R(μ) = 1/g_B(Λ) + (m/2πℏ²)ln(Λ²/μ²)
= 1/g_B(Λ) + (m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/μ). ✓

So I_shell = -(m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ'), and the RG map is 1/g_eff(Λ') = 1/g_B(Λ)-I_shell = 1/g_B(Λ)+(m/πℏ²)ln(Λ/Λ') ✓.

**VERIFIED.** ✓

**V2.4 FLAG (sev-2):** Paper §5.5 (Ladder trees / bubble chain) states:
"Its divergence structure is the simplest possible: repeated insertions of the same
logarithmically divergent loop."

But the paper also notes that each bubble-chain term I^n diverges as [ln Λ]^n.
The Bogoliubov subtraction cancels these iteratively. The paper correctly shows
counterterm cancellation at O(g_R²) in RG-D1.4.

However, RG-D1.4 contains an algebraic shortcut:
"g_B = g_R + g_R²·I_div + O(g_R³)"

This follows from: 1/g_B = 1/g_R + I_div → g_B = g_R + g_R²·I_div + ... ✓ (geometric series).

And then T = g_B + g_B²·I + O(g_B³):
= [g_R + g_R²·I_div] + [g_R + g_R²·I_div]²·[I_div+I_fin] + O(g_R³)
= g_R + g_R²·I_div + g_R²·(I_div+I_fin) + O(g_R³)
= g_R + g_R²·2I_div + g_R²·I_fin + O(g_R³)

But paper claims the I_div terms cancel:
T = g_R + g_R²·I_div + g_R²·(-I_div) + O(g_R³) = g_R + g_R²·I_fin + O(g_R³).

The paper's formula T = g_B + g_B²·I is wrong for geometric series. Let me redo:
T = g_B/(1-g_B·I) = g_B·Σ_{n≥0}(g_B·I)^n
At order g_R²: T ≈ g_B + g_B²·I = [g_R+g_R²I_div] + [g_R+g_R²I_div]²·I
= g_R + g_R²I_div + g_R²·I + O(g_R³)
= g_R + g_R²(I_div+I) + O(g_R³)
= g_R + g_R²(I_div+I_div+I_fin) + O(g_R³) ... still two I_div terms.

Something is wrong. Let me re-examine the paper's equation:
"T = g_R + g_R²(I_div+I_fin) + g_R²(-I_div) + O(g_R³) = g_R + g_R²·I_fin"

The three terms are: g_R (zeroth order), g_R²(I_div+I_fin) (first-order in I), g_R²(-I_div) (counterterm). This IS correct IF the counterterm contribution comes from the g_B expansion:
g_B = g_R + g_R²·I_div means:
T = g_B + g_B²·I = (g_R + g_R²·I_div) + g_R²·(I_div+I_fin)

Wait, that's g_R + g_R²·I_div (from g_B) + g_R²·I (from g_B²·I ≈ g_R²·I).
The counterterm "-I_div" comes from: the g_R²·I_div term in g_B MINUS the g_R²·I_div term in g_B²·I? That doesn't work.

**ACTUAL ISSUE:** The paper writes T = g_B + g_B²·I as if it's the first two terms of the geometric series g_B/(1-g_B·I). This is an O(g_B²) truncation, NOT the full resummed result. For the fully resummed result T = g_B/(1-g_B·I), the truncation is:
T = g_B + g_B²·I + O(g_B³)
= [g_R + g_R²·I_div] + [g_R²]·I + O(g_R³)
= g_R + g_R²·(I_div + I) + O(g_R³)
= g_R + g_R²·(I_div + I_div + I_fin) + O(g_R³)

This gives TWO powers of I_div, not one cancellation. The paper's derivation has a sign issue in the counterterm convention.

**Actually:** The paper defines the FULL resummed T, not the truncation:
T(E;Λ) = g_B/(1-g_B·I) = 1/(1/g_B - I) = 1/(1/g_R - I_fin) (after substituting 1/g_R = 1/g_B+I_div).

The perturbative expansion of the resummed T around g_R:
T = 1/(1/g_R - I_fin) = g_R/(1-g_R·I_fin)
= g_R + g_R²·I_fin + O(g_R³) ✓

The paper's RG-D1.4 expansion is CORRECT — it directly computes T = g_B/(1-g_B·I) and shows the I_div cancels — but the intermediate formulas are confusingly presented as if it's a term-by-term expansion while the actual result comes from the full resummed formula.

**V2.4 VERDICT (sev-2):** RG-D1.4 is mathematically correct (the final formula T = g_R + g_R²·I_fin is right) but the intermediate derivation is confusing. A reader checking term-by-term will find the I_div terms apparently don't cancel as stated. The paper should clarify: the full non-perturbative T (geometric series) is used, not a perturbative truncation. Recommended fix: explicitly write T = 1/(1/g_R - I_fin) and then expand.

**PRE-VOTE: YES (MINOR REVISION — 1 sev-2, 1 sev-3)**

**Required fixes:**
1. **(sev-2) §5.5/RG-D1.4:** Clarify that T = 1/(1/g_R - I_fin) (fully resummed formula,
   not perturbative truncation). The counterterm cancellation is clearest when written as:
   T = 1/(1/g_B - I) = 1/((1/g_R + I_div) - (I_div + I_fin)) = 1/(1/g_R - I_fin). ✓
   Add this one-line derivation before the Taylor expansion.
2. **(sev-3) §5.3 / RG-P1.2:** The formula κ*² = μ² exp(2πℏ²/(m·g_R(μ))) in §5.3 has
   the argument of the exponential written as "2πℏ²/m · 1/g_R(μ)" — verify this matches
   the sign convention for 1/g_R derived from 5.2 (where μ·d(1/g_R)/dμ = -m/(πℏ²)).
   This is consistent as verified above (§V1.4) but the paper should state sign convention
   once explicitly.

No sev-1 errors. The foundational argument (RG = semigroup compatibility forced by composition) is novel and well-executed. The 2D delta model is a clean worked example.

**Single-agent (mathematician). Two-agent rule: needs physicist for physical interpretation
of the sev-2 (whether the resummed vs perturbative distinction matters for the pedagogical
point) and confirmation that the 3D Wilsonian treatment is correct.**

## 4. Critic Second-Agent Review (2026-02-21)

**C4.1 (V1.1-V1.11 computations: CONCUR).** All explicit computations verified by mathematician are correct. Spot-checked: loop integral (V1.1), beta function (V1.3), kappa* mu-independence (V1.4), T-matrix (V1.11). No errors found. The V1.6 sign verification (T(E) in terms of kappa*) is particularly careful and correct.

**C4.2 (V2.4 sev-2: CONCUR and AMPLIFY).** The RG-D1.4 issue is real. The paper presents the counterterm cancellation as if it's a perturbative expansion T = g_B + g_B^2 I + ..., but the actual mechanism is the NON-PERTURBATIVE identity T = 1/(1/g_R - I_fin). A reader attempting term-by-term cancellation will get confused (two I_div terms, not one). Mathematician's recommended fix is minimal and correct: add the one-line chain T = 1/(1/g_B - I) = 1/((1/g_R + I_div) - (I_div + I_fin)) = 1/(1/g_R - I_fin). This is the single most important revision for this paper.

**C4.3 (Semigroup framing: SOUND).** RG-P1.1 (composition = Wilsonian semigroup) is correctly identified as the foundational contribution. The paper does NOT claim RG is new — it claims the SEMIGROUP FRAMING is the RCP partition-channel content of RG. This is a genuine insight: most RG presentations treat the semigroup as a convenience, not as forced by composition.

**C4.4 (Prior art check).** BoyaRivero1994 correctly cited. Manuel-Tarrach 1994 cited. Missing from current bibliography: Adhikari et al. (1988) on 2D delta regularization. Sev-3: add one reference.

**C4.5 (Scope assessment).** Paper is appropriately scoped: one worked example (2D delta), one general framework (RG = composition semigroup). Does not overreach into higher-loop or non-perturbative territory beyond the geometric series. The Schur complement analogy (RG-D1.7) is pedagogically effective and mathematically sound.

**C4.6 (Pre-vote verdict).** CONCUR: YES, MINOR REVISION (1 sev-2, 2 sev-3). Sev-2 fix is one line of algebra. Paper is READY after this fix.

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT** (mathematician + critic). Pre-vote: YES (MINOR REV).
