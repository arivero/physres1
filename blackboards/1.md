# OQ1a: Planck Area vs ℏ — Physicist Analysis

## 1. Setup and rewriting

**Standard amplitude:** $A = \exp(iS/\hbar)$

**Planck area:** $L_p^2 = \hbar G/c^3 \Rightarrow \hbar = L_p^2 c^3/G$

**Rewritten amplitude:**
$$A = \exp\!\Bigl(\frac{iSG}{L_p^2 c^3}\Bigr)$$

**Dimensional check** ($c=1$ units):
$$[SG/L_p^2 c^3] = [ML^2T^{-1}][L^3M^{-1}T^{-2}][L^{-2}][T^3L^{-3}] = 1 \checkmark$$

## 2. Is the rewriting merely notational?

**Free particle:** $S_{\rm free}=\int \frac{m\dot x^2}{2}dt$.
Amplitude $\exp(iS/\hbar)=\exp(iSG/L_p^2c^3)$ identically for $\hbar = L_p^2 c^3/G$.
No new physics.

**Verdict:** For non-gravitational systems, the rewriting is a tautological reparametrization.

**Physical content enters if and only if** $G$ (equivalently $L_p^2$) is taken as a *geometric* primitive — not just a numerical constant. This is the half-density program claim.

## 3. Half-density normalization in Planck-area units (D=4)

**Scalarization scale:** $\sigma_* = L_*^{-D/2}|dx|^{1/2}$.
In $D=4$: $L_*^{D/2} = L_*^2$ = an area.
Gravity-only sieve (PA-D1.3): $[G_4]=L^2$ matches $L^{D/2}$ at $D=4$ uniquely with integer power $n=1$.
Natural candidate: $L_* = L_p$, so $L_*^2 = L_p^2$.

**Half-density identity kernel** (PA-D1.2b):
$$K_{\rm Id}(x,y)=\delta^{(D)}(x-y)|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}$$
Scalarized with $L_*=L_p$ in $D=4$: $k_{\rm Id}=L_p^4\delta^{(4)}(x-y)$.

**Euclidean spacetime composition integral** ($D=4$):
$$K_{s_1+s_2}(x,z)=\int K_{s_1}(x,y)K_{s_2}(y,z)\,d^4y$$
With dimensionless kernels $\tilde K_s = L_p^4 K_s$:
$$\tilde K_{s_1+s_2}(x,z) = \int \tilde K_{s_1}(x,y)\tilde K_{s_2}(y,z)\frac{d^4y}{L_p^4}$$

$d^4y/L_p^4$ is the dimensionless 4-volume in Planck units.
**In $D=4$ only:** gravity supplies $L_p^4 = (G\hbar/c^3)^2$ without fractional coupling exponents.

---

## 4. Composition law structure

**Key formula:**
$$\tilde K_{s_1+s_2}(x,z)=\int \tilde K_{s_1}(x,y)\tilde K_{s_2}(y,z)\,\frac{d^4y}{L_p^4}$$

**Measure:** $d^4y/L_p^4 = d^4y\,c^6/(G^2\hbar^2)$.

**In $D\neq 4$:**
- Odd $D$: $D/2$ is half-integer; $[G_D]=L^{D-2}$ has integer dimension; no integer power of $G_D$ matches $L^{D/2}$ — parity obstruction (PA-D1.3a).
- Even $D\geq 6$: fractional power of $G_D$ required — magnitude obstruction.
- $D=2$: $G_2$ dimensionless, no scale.

Only $D=4$: the composition measure $d^4y/L_p^4$ is naturally dimensionless via gravity-only coupling.

**Limiting case $G\to 0$:** $L_p\to 0$; measure $d^4y/L_p^4\to\infty$.
Conclusion: taking $L_p^2$ as primitive requires gravity non-decoupable.
Consistent with RCP forced-completion chain (gravity is not optional).

## 5. D=4 — four independent mechanisms

| Mechanism | Reference | Type |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Gravity-only sieve: $[G_4]=L^2$ matches $L^{D/2}$ | PA-D1.3 | Scale supply |
| Conformal coincidence: $\xi_{\rm conf}=1/6$ at $D=4$ | HD-D1.3b | Simplicity |
| Operator simplicity: $D(4-D)(\partial\sigma)^2=0$ | HD-D1.3 | Simplicity (conformal class) |
| Heat-kernel: $a_1(\xi_{\rm conf})=0$ at $D=4$ | PA-D1.3c | Corollary of above |

Only the first supplies the area scale. The others show $D=4$ is the uniquely *simple* dimension.
All four are logically independent.

## 6. Physicist's verdict on OQ1a

**Two choices of primitive:**

**(a) $\hbar$ primitive (standard QM):** $L_p^2 = \hbar G/c^3$ is derived.
Amplitude: $\exp(iS/\hbar)$. No gravitational input needed for non-gravitational physics.

**(b) $L_p^2$ primitive (half-density program):** In $D=4$, the half-density scalarization requires an area; gravity-only sieve selects $L_p^2$ without fractional powers. Then $\hbar = L_p^2 c^3/G$ is derived.
Amplitude: $\exp(iSG/L_p^2c^3)$.

**Physical content of (b) beyond notation:**
1. UV structure: the path-integral normalization $\varepsilon^{-D/2}$ tied to $L_p^2$ — Planck area as natural UV regulator.
2. Composition measure: $d^4y/L_p^4$ dimensionless via gravity; fails for $D\neq 4$.
3. Conformal coincidence: half-density weight exactly cancels conformal coupling at $D=4$ — geometric and action scales are tuned together.

**Caveat:** (b) requires gravity non-decoupable. Valid within RCP chain; not standalone.

**Proposal for PA paper:** Add remark after PA-P1.2:
> The rewriting $A=\exp(iSG/L_p^2c^3)$ is physically non-trivial under (PA-H2.1+H2.4+H2.5a): the half-density scalarization selects $L_p^2$ as the area unit, making the composition measure $d^4y/L_p^4$ dimensionless by gravity alone in $D=4$. The action quantum $\hbar=L_p^2c^3/G$ is then derived, not fundamental.
Candidate label: Remark PA-P1.3.
Needs: Mathematician dimensional verification + Computationalist check of $D\neq 4$ obstruction.
