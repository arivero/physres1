# Dimensional Regularization: Non-Lattice Refinement Scheme
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S144

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 2 (after Remark 2.6 on optimal truncation, or in Section 4 after Remark 4.1). The paper develops the counterterm/refinement pattern using a momentum cutoff Λ as the "finite dissection depth." Dimensional regularization is the alternative where the spacetime dimension d = 4 - ε is the regulator. This provides a different "refinement scheme" that produces the same continuum limit — a concrete instance of refinement-scheme independence.

## Key Claims

### Dimensional regularization basics
In dim reg ('t Hooft and Veltman 1972), loop integrals are evaluated in d = 4 - ε dimensions. The UV divergences that appear as Λ → ∞ in a cutoff scheme instead appear as poles in 1/ε.

For a one-loop integral in φ⁴ theory:
  ∫ d^d k / (k² + m²) ~ Γ(1 - d/2) · (m²)^{d/2-1}

At d = 4 (ε → 0): the Gamma function has a pole Γ(ε/2 - 1) ~ 2/ε + ..., producing 1/ε divergences.

### Minimal subtraction (MS-bar)
The subtraction prescription in dim reg:
- MS (minimal subtraction): subtract only the 1/ε pole.
- MS-bar: subtract 1/ε + ln(4π) - γ_E (Euler-Mascheroni constant) — a standard conventional choice.

This is the analog of the evaluation-point prescription in Example 3.1 (α-ordering): the subtraction scheme is part of the definition, and different choices give different intermediate expressions but the same physical observables.

### Connection to the paper's themes

1. **Alternative refinement scheme**: Dim reg is not a "finite dissection" — there's no lattice, no partition, no mesh size. Instead, the "resolution" is controlled by the continuous parameter ε = 4 - d. Yet it produces the same renormalized physics as a cutoff, demonstrating that the continuum limit is independent of the specific regulator (refinement-scheme independence).

2. **Counterterm tower**: In dim reg, the counterterm tower of Remark 2.2 appears as a Laurent series in ε. At one loop: single 1/ε pole (analogous to removing the leading divergence). At L loops: poles up to 1/ε^L. The recursive subtraction (forest formula / BPHZ) ensures that subtracting poles order by order leaves a finite result — the exact analog of the order-by-order counterterm subtraction in Remark 2.2.

3. **Richardson extrapolation parallel**: The minimal subtraction procedure in dim reg is structurally parallel to Richardson extrapolation (Remark 2.4): in Richardson, you eliminate h^p terms without knowing their coefficients by comparing Q(h) and Q(h/2); in MS, you eliminate 1/ε poles without computing them explicitly by using the universality of the pole structure.

4. **Refinement-scheme independence as physics**: The statement that MS-bar and cutoff regularization give the same S-matrix elements is the QFT version of the statement that the trapezoidal rule and the midpoint rule give the same integral — the limit object is independent of the specific dissection scheme, provided the subtraction rules are applied consistently.

### Why dim reg is special
Dim reg preserves gauge invariance (Ward identities) and Lorentz invariance — a lattice cutoff breaks both. This is analogous to symplectic integrators (Remark 3.4) preserving structural invariants that generic integrators do not.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 4.2 in Section 4 (Outlook), after Remark 4.1 (Wilson RG). Or possibly Remark 2.7 after Remark 2.6.

Content: Dimensional regularization as an alternative refinement scheme where d = 4 - ε plays the role of the regulator. UV divergences appear as 1/ε poles (not Λ → ∞ divergences), and minimal subtraction is the counterterm prescription. The same renormalized observables emerge from both dim reg and cutoff regularization — refinement-scheme independence made explicit. Dim reg additionally preserves gauge and Lorentz invariance, paralleling the structural preservation of symplectic integrators in Remark 3.4.
