# Tan's Universal Contact Relations
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S173

## Context
Target: fermionic paper, Section 5 (after new Remark 5.8 on Levinson). Tan (2008)
showed that the short-range correlation structure of any quantum gas with s-wave
contact interactions is characterized by a single extensive quantity C (the "contact"),
which governs a family of exact universal relations. The contact is the microscopic
manifestation of the self-adjoint-extension parameter.

## Key Claims

### The Tan contact C
For a many-body system with s-wave contact interactions (any statistics, any
temperature), the single-particle momentum distribution obeys
  n(k) → C/k^4  as k → ∞
where C is the contact. This k^{-4} tail is universal: independent of temperature,
interaction strength details, and quantum statistics — only the VALUE of C depends
on the state.

### Universal relations
- Adiabatic sweep: dE/d(-1/a) = ℏ²C/(4πm)
- Pressure relation: P = (2E/3 + ℏ²C/(12πma))/V (3D)
- Pair correlation: g₂(r→0) ~ C/(4πr)² (the contact counts pairs at short range)
- RF spectroscopy tail: Γ(ω) ~ C · ω^{-3/2}

### Connection to paper's themes
1. The contact C is the thermodynamic shadow of the boundary-condition parameter a:
   it counts how many pairs are "at contact" (r→0), directly measuring the
   self-adjoint-extension data in many-body observables
2. The k^{-4} tail is the momentum-space face of the delta-function contact
   interaction of Section 4 — the same distributional structure that produces
   δ(r) in Derivation 4.1
3. The adiabatic sweep relation connects to Examples 5.1-5.2: varying the
   scattering length (= moving along the RG flow) costs energy proportional
   to the contact

## Proposed Remark
Remark 5.9 (or 5.8 if Levinson becomes 5.8) in fermionic.
