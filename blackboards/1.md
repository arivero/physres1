# Blackboard 1 — Operator product expansion as QFT contact expansion (Section 4, fermionic)

## Target
Remark 4.5 in fermionic-mediators, after Remark 4.4 (line 121), before Section 5.

## Core content

Wilson's operator product expansion (OPE, 1969) is the QFT generalization
of the contact expansion of Derivation 4.1.

When two local operators O_A(x) and O_B(0) approach each other (|x| → 0),
their product admits an asymptotic expansion in local operators at the
coincidence point:

  O_A(x) O_B(0) ~ Σ_k C_k^{AB}(x) O_k(0)

where the Wilson coefficient functions C_k^{AB}(x) are singular as |x| → 0,
with degree of singularity set by dimensional analysis:
  C_k ~ |x|^{Δ_k - Δ_A - Δ_B}

Parallel with the contact expansion:
1. Leading term (identity operator O_k = 1): gives the free-field
   two-point function, the propagator K⁻¹ of Section 2.
2. Subleading terms: suppressed by positive powers of |x|·Λ_UV,
   paralleling the q²/Λ² suppression of C_2, C_4, ... in the EFT.
3. Hierarchy principle: degrees of freedom not resolved at scale |x|
   contribute through a tower of local operators with systematically
   decreasing importance — the same structural principle as the
   contact expansion encoding unresolved short-range physics.

Key distinction:
- The OPE is an operator identity (valid inside any correlation function),
  whereas the contact expansion of Derivation 4.1 is a Born-level
  amplitude statement.
- The OPE coefficient functions can be computed perturbatively (anomalous
  dimensions give logarithmic corrections to the power-law scaling),
  providing a systematic short-distance expansion analogous to the
  momentum-space EFT.

Connection to the paper's theme:
- The OPE shows that the "contact" principle extends beyond
  nonrelativistic scattering: any QFT with a mass gap has an OPE
  whose coefficients encode the short-distance physics in the same
  hierarchical way as the C_0 + C_2 q² + ... expansion.
- The Callan-Symanzik equation (Remark 4.9 in uncuttable) governs the
  scale dependence of OPE coefficients — the anomalous dimensions
  are the QFT counterpart of the beta function for contact couplings.
