## Target
Remark 6.5 in fermionic paper, after Remark 6.4 (color confinement),
before References.

## Core content

The Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation is the systematic
path-integral technique for converting a four-fermion interaction
into an auxiliary bosonic field exchange — making the "emergent
boson" of Remark 6.1 manifest.

Starting point: a four-fermion interaction
  S_int = -g ∫ (ψ̄ψ)²

Introduce an auxiliary scalar field σ via a Gaussian identity:
  exp(g ∫ (ψ̄ψ)²) = ∫ Dσ exp(-∫ [σ²/(4g) + σ ψ̄ψ])

After the HS transformation:
- The quartic fermion coupling becomes a Yukawa coupling σψ̄ψ
- The fermion integral is now Gaussian in ψ and can be performed:
  ∫ Dψ̄Dψ exp(-ψ̄(∂̸-m-σ)ψ) = det(∂̸-m-σ)
- The determinant is a bosonic functional of σ → effective action
  for the composite field σ

Connection to Remark 6.1 (Cooper pairing):
- In the BCS channel, the HS field is the gap parameter Δ
- The saddle-point of the HS action gives the BCS gap equation
- Fluctuations around the saddle give the collective modes
  (Anderson-Bogoliubov sound mode, Higgs amplitude mode)

Connection to Remark 6.3 (nuclear forces):
- The Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model uses HS transformation
  to introduce σ and π fields from quartic quark interactions
- At the saddle point: chiral symmetry breaking ⟨σ⟩ ≠ 0
- Pions emerge as the (pseudo-)Goldstone bosons

The structural point:
- The HS transformation is the PATH-INTEGRAL version of the
  observation that fermion exchange → bosonic composite
- It provides an explicit, systematic construction (not just
  a heuristic observation)
- The resulting bosonic field theory inherits the RG flow of
  the original fermionic theory through the fermion determinant
