# Blackboard 1 — 't Hooft anomaly matching (Section 6, fermionic mediators)

## Target
Remark 6.6 in fermionic paper, after Remark 6.5 (Hubbard-Stratonovich),
closing Section 6.

## Core content

The fermion → emergent boson chain of Section 6 is constrained by
anomaly matching: the composite low-energy theory must reproduce the
same anomalies as the fundamental high-energy theory.

Key physics:
- 't Hooft (1980) anomaly matching condition: if a global symmetry G
  is anomalous in the UV theory (computed from the fundamental fermion
  content), then the same anomaly must appear in the IR theory —
  either from massless composite fermions or from Goldstone bosons
  (via the Wess-Zumino-Witten term)
- The argument is topological/non-perturbative: anomaly coefficients
  are integers (they count topological invariants), so they cannot
  change under continuous RG flow — they are "RG invariants"
- Application to QCD (Remarks 6.3-6.4): the fundamental theory has
  N_f quarks in the fundamental representation, giving anomaly
  coefficients for SU(N_f)_L × SU(N_f)_R × U(1)_B. The IR theory
  must reproduce these. With chiral symmetry breaking SU(N_f)_L ×
  SU(N_f)_R → SU(N_f)_V, the pions (Goldstone bosons) carry the
  anomaly through the Wess-Zumino-Witten term — this is what
  determines the π⁰ → γγ decay rate
- The anomaly matching provides a non-perturbative constraint on the
  Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation of Remark 6.5: not every
  choice of HS channel is physically consistent — the correct one
  must match anomalies
- Connection to index theorems: the anomaly coefficient is computed
  by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, connecting the spectral
  asymmetry of the Dirac operator to the topology of the gauge bundle

Connection to the paper:
- Constrains the fermion → boson chain: the composites are not
  arbitrary but must be "anomaly-compatible" with the fundamental
  fermions
- The π⁰ → γγ rate (Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly) is experimentally
  verified and directly tests that pions carry the quark anomaly
- Provides a deep reason why the Grassmann-source obstruction of
  Section 3 is not merely a formal curiosity but reflects genuine
  non-trivial structure in the UV-IR connection
- The WZW term on the pion manifold is a topological term — the
  same class of structure as the θ-vacuum (if discussed) and the
  Berry phase of the companion notes
