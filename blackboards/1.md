# Blackboard 1 — Quantized vortices in superfluids (Section 3, action-angle)

## Target
Remark 3.4 in action-angle paper, after Remark 3.3 (OAM of light),
before Section 4.

## Core content

The azimuthal Fourier structure e^{imφ} of Section 3 is not merely a
single-particle phenomenon: it governs the macroscopic wavefunction of
a superfluid or Bose-Einstein condensate. The macroscopic order parameter
Ψ(r) = √ρ(r) e^{iS(r)/ℏ} carries a quantized circulation:

  ∮ v · dl = (h/m) n,   n ∈ Z

where v = (ℏ/m) ∇S is the superfluid velocity, and the quantization
follows from single-valuedness of Ψ around any closed loop — exactly
the same condition that quantizes m in Section 3.

Key physics:
1. **Onsager-Feynman quantization** (Onsager 1949, Feynman 1955):
   the circulation quantum κ = h/m is a macroscopic manifestation
   of ℏ. In ⁴He, κ = 9.97×10⁻⁸ m²/s.
2. **Vortex core**: at the center of a vortex with winding number n,
   the phase winds by 2πn, forcing |Ψ| → 0 — the same topological
   zero as the OAM beam's on-axis singularity (Remark 3.3).
3. **BEC vortices**: in dilute-gas BECs (Matthews et al. 1999,
   Madison et al. 2000), vortices with n = 1 are directly imaged.
   Higher winding numbers (n > 1) are energetically unstable and
   decay into n single-quantum vortices.
4. **Abrikosov lattice**: in type-II superconductors, the magnetic
   field penetrates as quantized flux tubes (Φ₀ = h/2e for Cooper
   pairs), which self-organize into a triangular lattice — the
   superfluid vortex structure made visible by magnetic flux
   quantization (Abrikosov 1957, Nobel Prize 2003).
5. **Action-angle connection**: the winding number n is the action
   variable (quantized), and the overall phase S₀ of the condensate
   (the "condensate phase") is the conjugate angle — delocalized
   when the particle number N is sharp (number-phase uncertainty,
   Remark 2.1). The Anderson-Josephson relation dφ/dt = -μ/ℏ
   (where μ is the chemical potential) makes the phase dynamics
   explicit: Josephson oscillations between coupled condensates are
   the macroscopic manifestation of the number-phase tradeoff.

Connection to the paper:
- Same e^{imφ} structure as Section 3, now in a macroscopic
  many-body wavefunction rather than a single particle
- Topological zero at vortex core = same as OAM beam axis (Remark 3.3)
- Number-phase duality of the condensate = macroscopic version of
  Remark 2.1 (number-phase pair)
- Josephson effect = dynamical manifestation of the tradeoff
