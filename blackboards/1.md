# Blackboard 1 — Constructive QFT (Section 4, uncuttable)

## Target
Remark 4.11 in uncuttable paper, after Remark 4.10 (Kadanoff block
spins), before the concluding paragraph.

## Core content

The entire paper discusses "controlled refinement limits" but
Section 4 describes the RG framework without asking: do these
limits actually EXIST rigorously?

Constructive QFT is the program to prove rigorously that the
continuum limits described in Remarks 4.1-4.10 exist:

Rigorous constructions achieved:
- φ⁴ in d=2: Glimm and Jaffe (1968-1973), using cluster expansions
  and Osterwalder-Schrader axioms to prove Wightman axioms
- φ⁴ in d=3: Feldman and Osterwalder (1976), Magnen and Sénéor (1977)
- Gross-Neveu model in d=2: de Calan, Faria da Veiga, Magnen, Sénéor
- 2D Yang-Mills: Migdal, Witten (exact solution)

Not yet achieved (open problems):
- φ⁴ in d=4: the "triviality" problem — perturbatively well-defined
  but non-perturbatively the Landau pole may make the theory trivial
  (only the free theory survives the continuum limit). Lattice evidence
  supports triviality for pure φ⁴.
- Yang-Mills in d=4 with mass gap: the Clay Millennium Prize problem
  (already mentioned in Remark 4.3). This is THE definitive open
  question about whether the "uncuttable" pattern of this paper has a
  rigorous mathematical realization for the most physically important case.

The structural lesson:
- Perturbative renormalizability (Remarks 4.1-4.2) guarantees a formal
  refinement limit order by order in the coupling
- Constructive QFT asks whether the FULL non-perturbative limit exists
- The gap between "formal" and "rigorous" is exactly the gap between
  Section 2's toy models (where convergence is provable) and Section 4's
  QFT (where it is still partly open)
