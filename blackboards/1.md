# Conformal Symmetry at RG Fixed Points
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S157

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 4 (Outlook), Remark 4.6 after Remark 4.5 (anomalies).
The paper discusses Wilson's RG (Remark 4.1) and EFT (Remark 4.4). The natural endpoint of the RG flow discussion is the fixed-point structure — and at an RG fixed point, the theory acquires enhanced symmetry: conformal (scale + special conformal) invariance.

## Key Claims

### RG fixed points and conformal symmetry
At an RG fixed point β(g*) = 0, the theory is scale-invariant: it looks the same at every resolution. In d ≥ 2 spacetime dimensions, scale invariance combined with unitarity and Poincaré invariance generically implies the larger conformal symmetry — the group SO(d,2) in Euclidean signature. This was conjectured by Polyakov (1970) and proven in d=2 by Zamolodchikov (1986, via the c-theorem: c decreases along RG flows and is stationary at fixed points) and in d=4 by Komargodski and Schwimmer (2011, via the a-theorem: the Euler central charge a plays the analogous role).

### Conformal field theory as the "uncuttable" target
1. **Resolution-independence**: A CFT is the ultimate "refinement limit" — it has no intrinsic scale, so it looks identical at every resolution. The coupling is at its fixed-point value, and no further RG flow is possible.

2. **Operator dimensions**: In a CFT, every local operator has a definite scaling dimension Δ (which need not be an integer), determined by the conformal algebra. The OPE (operator product expansion) O_i(x)O_j(0) ~ Σ_k C_{ijk} |x|^{Δ_k-Δ_i-Δ_j} O_k(0) is convergent, and the structure constants C_{ijk} are the dynamical data. This is the "uncuttable" analog for operators: the short-distance behavior is not captured by any single Taylor coefficient but by an infinite tower of OPE contributions organized by scaling dimension.

3. **Conformal bootstrap**: The modern conformal bootstrap program uses only symmetry and unitarity (no Lagrangian needed) to constrain and sometimes determine the structure constants and operator dimensions. This is the most extreme form of "the refinement limit determines itself": the requirement of self-consistency at the fixed point constrains the theory, sometimes uniquely (as in the 3D Ising model CFT).

4. **c-theorem / a-theorem (irreversibility of RG)**: The RG flow between fixed points is irreversible: the c-function (d=2) or a-function (d=4) decreases monotonically along the flow, so the theory cannot return to a UV fixed point after flowing away. This is the "arrow" of refinement — coarse-graining loses information, and there are fewer degrees of freedom at large distances than at short distances.

### Connection to "uncuttable" theme
The CFT at a fixed point is the "target" of the refinement limit in the strongest possible sense. The fact that this target has enhanced symmetry (conformal, not just scale) is a structural consequence of unitarity — a constraint that the refinement procedure must satisfy. The monotonicity of the c/a-function adds directionality: the refinement flow has a preferred direction.

## Proposed Remark
Remark 4.6 in uncuttable Section 4, after Remark 4.5 (anomalies).
Content: At an RG fixed point, the theory is scale-invariant; unitarity + Poincaré invariance promote this to conformal symmetry SO(d,2). Zamolodchikov's c-theorem (d=2) and the a-theorem (d=4) prove the RG flow is irreversible: c (or a) decreases monotonically between UV and IR fixed points. This is the "arrow of refinement" — coarse-graining loses degrees of freedom. The conformal bootstrap uses only self-consistency to constrain fixed-point data, the most extreme form of "the refinement limit determines itself."
