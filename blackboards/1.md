# Blackboard 1 — QND measurement of action variables (Section 5, action-angle)

## Target
Remark 5.7 in action-angle paper, after Remark 5.6 (quantum Zeno),
before Section 6.

## Core content

Quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement completes the measurement story
of Remarks 5.2 (decoherence) and 5.6 (Zeno effect).

Definition: A QND measurement of observable A satisfies:
  [A, H] = 0 (A commutes with the free Hamiltonian)
so that the measurement does not disturb the subsequent free evolution.
Equivalently: measuring A repeatedly yields the same result without
back-action on A.

For action variables (N̂ or L_z):
- Both N̂ and L_z commute with the respective Hamiltonians (H = ℏω(N̂+1/2)
  for the oscillator, H depends on L_z² + ... for central potentials)
- Therefore, action variables are natural QND observables
- Repeated measurement of N̂ or L_z does not disturb the system's
  free evolution — it only projects onto the corresponding eigenstate,
  which is stationary anyway

The key experimental example: dispersive photon number measurement
in circuit/cavity QED (Braginsky and Khalili, 1992; Nogues et al., 1999).
A qubit coupled dispersively to a cavity mode acquires a phase shift
proportional to the photon number n, without absorbing or emitting photons:
  H_disp = ℏ χ n̂ σ_z
Reading the qubit phase gives n̂ without destroying the Fock state.

Connection to Sections 5.6 and 5.2:
- The Zeno effect (Remark 5.6) uses projective measurements that are
  "QND by brute force" — they project AND freeze. QND measurement is
  the gentler version: it reads the action without freezing the dynamics
  (because the action is already conserved).
- Decoherence (Remark 5.2) selects coherent states via position coupling.
  QND measurement selects Fock states via action coupling. The choice
  of coupling determines which extreme of the action-angle tradeoff
  is enforced.

The "uncuttable" connection:
- The back-action-free measurement of an action variable has no conjugate
  cost if the conjugate angle is not measured. But any attempt to
  simultaneously measure the angle would violate the QND condition,
  because angle measurement requires coupling to operators that do
  not commute with the action.
