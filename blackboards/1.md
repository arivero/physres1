# Blackboard 1 — Delta-Object Dictionary and Safe/Unsafe Criterion

## Context
D24 discovery cycle + S281 study cycle. The goal is a referee-safe dictionary
of "delta objects" used across the manuscripts, with worked toy witnesses and
a single safe/unsafe classification criterion.

## 1. Dictionary of Delta Objects

Five delta-adjacent constructions appear in the manuscripts. They have very
different mathematical meanings:

| # | Object | Definition | Domain | Math status |
|---|--------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | \(\delta(f')\) or \(\delta(\nabla f)\) | Delta distribution applied to the **function** \(f'\) (or \(\nabla f\)), localizing on the zero set \(\{f'=0\}\) | Finite-dim, smooth \(f\) with nondegenerate critical pts | **Rigorous** (distributional change of variables / coarea formula) |
| 2 | \(\delta'\) | **Distributional derivative** of \(\delta\): \(\langle\delta',\varphi\rangle=-\varphi'(0)\) | Standard distributions \(\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R})\) | **Rigorous** |
| 3 | \(\delta^{(d)}(x-y)\,|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}\) | Diagonal delta kernel = Schwartz kernel of the identity on half-densities | Manifolds of dim \(d\); bi-half-density kernel | **Rigorous** (Schwartz kernel theorem) |
| 4 | \(g\,\delta^{(d)}(x)\) as potential | Point interaction / rank-one perturbation \(g|0\rangle\langle0|\) | \(d \le 3\): self-adjoint extension; \(d \ge 4\): trivial | **Rigorous** but \(d \ge 2\) **requires renormalization** |
| 5 | "\(\delta(\delta S)\)" on path space | Formal "measure supported on stationary-action paths" | Infinite-dimensional path space | **Heuristic only** — no Lebesgue measure on path space (H0.2a); must be regulated |

### Do / Don't Table

| Do (safe) | Don't (unsafe) |
|-----------|----------------|
| Write \(\delta(f'(x)) = \sum_i \delta(x-x_i)/|f''(x_i)|\) for finite-dim smooth \(f\) with nondegenerate critical points | Write \(\delta(\delta S)\) as if it defines an honest measure on path space |
| Use \(\delta'\) via duality \(\langle\delta',\varphi\rangle = -\varphi'(0)\); realize it as a point-splitting limit \((\delta(\cdot+\varepsilon)-\delta)/\varepsilon \to \delta'\) | Conflate \(\delta(f')\) (stationary-set localization) with \(\delta'\) (distributional derivative) |
| Treat diagonal delta kernels as bi-half-densities: \(\delta^{(d)}(x-y)|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}\) | Form products \(\delta(t)^2\) in standard distribution theory (Schwartz impossibility) |
| Use \(\delta\) potentials in \(d \le 3\) with explicit self-adjoint extension data | Treat \(\delta\) potentials in \(d \ge 4\) as well-defined without comment |
| Say "the time-sliced path integral with \(N\to\infty\) recovers extremal support in the stationary-phase sense" | Say "the path integral measure \(\mathcal{D}q\) is supported on extremal paths via \(\delta(\delta S)\)" |

## 2. The Safe/Unsafe Criterion (single test)

**Mollifier-universality criterion.** A delta-object construction is *safe*
(scheme-independent, referee-proof) if and only if its defining limit is
**universal over mollifier kernels**: the result does not depend on the choice
of regularizing kernel \(\rho \in C_c^\infty\) with \(\int\rho=1\).

**When mollifier universality holds:**
- Evaluating a continuous functional against a mollifier sequence
  (\(\int F(t)\rho_\varepsilon(t-t_0)\,dt \to F(t_0)\)): YES, universal.
- Computing \(\delta(f')\) by the change-of-variables formula for smooth \(f\)
  with nondegenerate critical points: YES, universal (the identity
  \(\delta(f')=\sum_i \delta(x-x_i)/|f''(x_i)|\) is independent of the mollifier).
- Point-splitting limit \((\delta(\cdot+\varepsilon)-\delta)/\varepsilon\to\delta'\):
  YES, universal (converges in \(\mathcal{D}'\) independent of the regularization).

**When mollifier universality fails (scheme-dependent, unsafe):**
- Products \(\delta(t)^2\): the regularized answer \(\int\rho_\varepsilon(t)^2\,dt
  = \|\rho\|_{L^2}^2/\varepsilon\) diverges and depends on \(\rho\).
  This is the Schwartz impossibility theorem at work.
- Diagonal Green function \(G_0(0,0;E)\) in \(d\ge 2\): the coincident-point
  evaluation diverges; the physical answer (bound state energy, scattering
  length) requires a renormalization condition to fix the regulator dependence.
- Formal "\(\delta(\delta S)\)" on path space: there is no translation-invariant
  measure to mollify against (H0.2a), so the construction is meaningless
  without an explicit finite-dimensional approximation (time slicing) and a
  composition-compatible normalization.

**Summary sentence:** *A delta construction is safe precisely when it evaluates
a continuous (or otherwise well-defined) object against a converging mollifier
sequence, so that the result is independent of the mollifier. When the object
being probed has a diagonal singularity or involves a distribution product,
the result is scheme-dependent and requires renormalization or an explicit
regulated substitute.*

## 3. Witness Computation A: Point Splitting for \(\delta'\)

**Claim:** \((\delta(\cdot+\varepsilon)-\delta)/\varepsilon \to \delta'\) in \(\mathcal{D}'\).

**Proof (distributional).** For any \(\varphi\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb{R})\),
\[
\left\langle \frac{\delta(\cdot+\varepsilon)-\delta}{\varepsilon},\varphi\right\rangle
= \frac{\varphi(-\varepsilon)-\varphi(0)}{\varepsilon}.
\]
As \(\varepsilon\to 0\), this converges to \(-\varphi'(0)=\langle\delta',\varphi\rangle\).

**Why this is safe:** The test function \(\varphi\) is smooth, so the difference
quotient converges by the definition of derivative. No regularity hypothesis
on a "probed object" is needed — the smoothness is in the test function space.
The construction is mollifier-universal: it does not depend on any regulator choice.

## 4. Witness Computation B: Stationary-Set Identity

**Claim (1D):** For smooth \(f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) with finitely many
nondegenerate critical points \(x_i\) (i.e., \(f'(x_i)=0\), \(f''(x_i)\neq 0\)),
\[
\delta(f'(x)) = \sum_i \frac{\delta(x-x_i)}{|f''(x_i)|}.
\]

**Proof (distributional change of variables).** Near each \(x_i\), set
\(u = f'(x)\). Then \(du = f''(x)\,dx\), so \(dx = du/|f''(x)|\) (the absolute
value handles the change-of-variables for distributions). The delta
\(\delta(u)\) picks out \(u=0\), i.e., \(x=x_i\). Summing over all roots:
\[
\int \delta(f'(x))\,\varphi(x)\,dx
= \sum_i \int \delta(u)\,\frac{\varphi(x_i(u))}{|f''(x_i(u))|}\,du
= \sum_i \frac{\varphi(x_i)}{|f''(x_i)|}.
\]

**Multi-dimensional extension.** For \(f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}\) with
nondegenerate critical points, the coarea formula gives:
\[
\delta^{(n)}(\nabla f(x)) = \sum_i \frac{\delta^{(n)}(x-x_i)}{|\det\mathrm{Hess}\,f(x_i)|}.
\]

**Why this is safe:** The change of variables is valid because \(f\) is smooth
and the critical points are nondegenerate (\(f''\neq 0\) or \(\det\mathrm{Hess}\neq 0\)),
so the map \(x\mapsto f'(x)\) (or \(x\mapsto\nabla f(x)\)) is a local diffeomorphism
near each zero. No mollifier choice enters; the identity is a theorem of distribution
theory, not a regularization-dependent statement.

**Connection to stationary phase and half-densities:** The density weights
\(1/|f''(x_i)|\) are the squares of the amplitude weights \(1/\sqrt{|f''(x_i)|}\)
from stationary phase. This is the finite-dimensional prototype of "amplitudes
are half-densities; probabilities are densities" (delta-objects paper, Section 3.3).

## 5. When Is "\(\delta(\delta S)\)" Acceptable?

**Never literally.** The expression "\(\delta(\delta S)\)" suggests a delta
distribution applied to the functional \(\delta S\) on path space. This would
require:
1. A background measure on path space against which \(\delta(\delta S)\) is a
   density — but no such measure exists (H0.2a: no Lebesgue/Haar measure on
   infinite-dimensional spaces).
2. The functional \(\delta S\) to be "nondegenerate at zeros" in the sense of
   the finite-dimensional change-of-variables formula — but the relevant
   Hessian (second variation \(\delta^2 S\)) is an operator, not a number,
   and its "determinant" requires regularization (zeta-function determinant,
   Pauli-Van Vleck-Morette prescription, etc.).

**Acceptable as shorthand only under two conditions:**
1. **Immediately preceded or followed by a regulated substitute.** E.g.,
   "In the time-sliced approximation with \(N\) intermediate points, the
   stationary-phase evaluation localizes on classical paths; informally,
   this is the content of '\(\delta(\delta S)\).'"
2. **Explicitly flagged as heuristic.** E.g., "The slogan '\(\delta(\delta S)\)
   concentrates on extremals' is a finite-dimensional analogy (Section 5.5);
   on path space it requires the composition-compatible regularization of
   Section 6."

**The regulated substitute:** In the manuscripts, the regulated version is
already in place. It is the two-step construction:
- *Step 1 (finite approximation):* Use the \(N\)-point time-sliced action
  \(S_N[\{q_k\}]\) and apply the finite-dimensional stationary-phase identity
  \(\delta^{(N)}(\nabla_{q_1,\ldots,q_N} S_N)\) with determinant weights.
- *Step 2 (composition-compatible limit):* Take \(N\to\infty\) with the
  half-density normalization \((m/(2\pi i\hbar\Delta t))^{(N+1)/2}\) that
  makes each intermediate integration a canonical half-density pairing.
  The limit exists (in suitable senses: Trotter product formula for the
  operator; stationary-phase asymptotics for the kernel) and reproduces
  the semiclassical propagator with Van Vleck determinant prefactor.
