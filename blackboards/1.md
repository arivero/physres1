# Blackboard 1 — Heavy-mediator decoupling (Section 4, fermionic)

## Target
Remark 4.6 in fermionic paper, after Remark 4.5 (OPE), before Section 5.

## Core content

The contact expansion of Section 4 is not merely a mathematical
convenience — it is the physical outcome of integrating out a heavy
mediator. The decoupling limit makes this explicit.

Setup: A scalar Yukawa mediator of mass M couples to a fermion with
coupling g. The tree-level amplitude for two-body scattering is:

  A(q) = g²/(q² + M²)

In the limit M → ∞ with G := g²/M² held fixed:

  A(q) → G [1 - q²/M² + O(q⁴/M⁴)] → G = C₀

Key physics:
1. **Contact limit**: The Yukawa potential V(r) = -(g²/4πr) e^{-Mr}
   becomes V(r) → -(g²/M²) δ³(r) = -C₀ δ³(r) as M → ∞. The range
   shrinks to zero, but the strength C₀ = g²/M² remains finite. This
   is exactly the leading term of the contact expansion (Derivation 4.1).

2. **Matching condition**: C₀ = g²/M² is the Wilson coefficient that
   matches the UV theory (Yukawa exchange at scale M) to the IR theory
   (contact interaction). This matching is the "comparison across
   refinements" of the companion uncuttable note.

3. **Universality**: Different UV completions — scalar Yukawa (C₀ = g²/M²),
   vector exchange (C₀ = g_V²/M_V²), t-channel fermion exchange
   (with appropriate Fierz rearrangement) — can all produce the same
   C₀, hence the same low-energy physics. The contact coefficient
   is universal in the sense that it does not determine the UV
   completion uniquely.

4. **Decoupling theorem**: The Appelquist-Carazzone theorem (1975)
   guarantees that heavy particles decouple from low-energy physics
   up to power corrections O(E²/M²). The contact expansion IS this
   power-correction tower, with each C₂n encoding the next order
   of the non-decoupling effect.

5. **Connection to EFT (Remark 4.4)**: The heavy-mediator limit is
   the simplest instance of the matching procedure that defines EFT:
   compute in the full theory, expand in q/M, and identify Wilson
   coefficients. Weinberg's power counting (Remark 4.4) then organizes
   the result systematically.

Connection to the paper:
- Makes the contact expansion of Derivation 4.1 physically concrete:
  it's what remains after integrating out the mediator
- Connects Section 2 (bosonic exchange) to Section 4 (contact limit)
- Demonstrates universality: the contact data does not uniquely
  determine the UV completion
- The Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem is the field-theoretic
  justification for the contact truncation
