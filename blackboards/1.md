# Painleve II: tau = Det(1-K) Verification

## §1. Setup

Conjecture 6.1 (painleve notebook): tau-function = groupoid partition function.
Concrete instance: Tracy-Widom (1994).

\(F_2(s) = \exp\bigl(-\int_s^\infty (x-s)\,q(x)^2\,dx\bigr)\)

where \(q(x)\) solves Painleve II: \(q'' = 2q^3 + xq\), \(q(x) \to \mathrm{Ai}(x)\) as \(x\to+\infty\) (Hastings-McLeod).

## §2. Fredholm determinant

\(F_2(s) = \det(1 - K_{\mathrm{Ai}}|_{[s,\infty)})\)

Airy kernel: \(K(x,y) = \frac{\mathrm{Ai}(x)\mathrm{Ai}'(y) - \mathrm{Ai}'(x)\mathrm{Ai}(y)}{x-y}\).
Diagonal: \(K(x,x) = \mathrm{Ai}'(x)^2 - x\,\mathrm{Ai}(x)^2\).

Extended form: \(K(x,y) = \int_0^\infty \mathrm{Ai}(x+t)\mathrm{Ai}(y+t)\,dt\).
Verified: both forms agree numerically (\(K(0,0) = K_{\mathrm{ext}}(0,0) = 0.066987\)).

## §3. Numeric verification (scipy)

| \(s\) | \(F_2\) (PII ODE) | \(\det(1-K)\) (Gauss-Legendre, \(n=150\)) | Rel diff |
|---|---|---|---|
| \(-4.0\) | 0.00354456 | 0.00354455 | \(1.3\times 10^{-6}\) |
| \(-3.0\) | 0.08031958 | 0.08031955 | \(3.1\times 10^{-7}\) |
| \(-2.0\) | 0.41322439 | 0.41322414 | \(5.9\times 10^{-7}\) |
| \(-1.0\) | 0.80721431 | 0.80721424 | \(9.0\times 10^{-8}\) |
| \(0.0\) | 0.96937290 | 0.96937283 | \(7.6\times 10^{-8}\) |
| \(+1.0\) | 0.99750544 | 0.99750544 | \(3.2\times 10^{-9}\) |
| \(+2.0\) | 0.99988755 | 0.99988755 | \(6.3\times 10^{-10}\) |

Max relative difference: \(1.3 \times 10^{-6}\). **VERIFIED.**

## §4. Distribution moments cross-check

| Quantity | Computed | Known (DLMF/Tracy-Widom) |
|---|---|---|
| Normalization | 1.0000 | 1 |
| Mean | \(-1.7711\) | \(-1.7711\) |
| Variance | 0.8132 | 0.8132 |

Moments match to 4 significant figures. Confirms correct BC (Hastings-McLeod).

## §5. Eigenvalue structure of \(K_{\mathrm{Ai}}|_{[-2,\infty)}\)

| \(j\) | \(\lambda_j\) |
|---|---|
| 0 | 0.5766 |
| 1 | 0.0239 |
| 2 | 0.00019 |
| 3 | \(1.0 \times 10^{-6}\) |
| \(\geq 4\) | \(< 10^{-10}\) |

Eigenvalues decay super-exponentially. \(\det(1-K) = \prod_j(1-\lambda_j)\).
Trace class: all \(\lambda_j \in [0,1)\). Kernel is positive semidefinite.

## §6. Groupoid partition function assessment

**Claim (Conjecture 6.1):** "tau = groupoid partition function."

**Analysis:**

1. \(\det(1-K) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n!}\int\cdots\int \det[K(x_i,x_j)]_{i,j}\,dx_1\cdots dx_n\).
   This IS a partition function: sum over \(n\)-point configurations weighted by kernel determinant.

2. The "groupoid" is the **pair groupoid** on \([s,\infty)\):
   objects = points \(x\), morphisms = ordered pairs \((x,y)\), weight = \(K(x,y)\).

3. This structure is **generic**: ANY Fredholm determinant \(\det(1-K)\) for ANY kernel \(K\)
   on ANY space \(X\) is a "pair groupoid partition function" in this sense.

4. The **specific** identity \(\tau_{\mathrm{PII}} = \det(1-K_{\mathrm{Ai}})\) comes from
   **integrability** (Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno 1981, Tracy-Widom 1994), NOT from groupoid theory.
   The Airy kernel arises from the Lax pair structure of PII, not from a groupoid axiom.

5. The **monodromy groupoid** (P2.2 in painleve notebook: objects = singular points,
   morphisms = Stokes matrices) is a DIFFERENT structure from the pair groupoid on \([s,\infty)\).
   The connection between the two is mediated by the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence
   (monodromy data \(\leftrightarrow\) analytic kernel), which is a deep theorem, not a definition.

## §7. Verdict

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| \(\tau_{\mathrm{PII}} = \det(1-K_{\mathrm{Ai}})\) | VERIFIED (numeric, \(10^{-6}\) accuracy) |
| Groupoid interpretation is TRIVIALLY TRUE | YES (pair groupoid, generic for any Fredholm det) |
| Groupoid interpretation is SPECIFIC to isomonodromy | NO |
| Monodromy groupoid \(\neq\) pair groupoid | CORRECT |
| Conjecture 6.1 as stated | VACUOUSLY TRUE but NON-SPECIFIC |

**Corrected framing:** The tau-function IS a Fredholm determinant (proven theorem, not conjecture).
The "groupoid partition function" label adds no information beyond "Fredholm determinant."
The genuinely non-trivial content is: (a) WHICH kernel (Airy, from Lax pair + RH correspondence),
and (b) WHY this kernel (integrability axiom \(I_{\mathrm{int}}\), not composition alone).

## §8. Computational details

- PII integration: DOP853 (8th order), \(x \in [20, -10]\), rtol \(10^{-13}\), 4601 steps.
- Fredholm det: Gauss-Legendre \(n=150\) on \([s, s+L]\), \(L = 20\).
- Scripts: `tmp/painleve_tau_verify.py`, `tmp/painleve_tau_v2.py`, `tmp/painleve_tw_convention.py`.

**SINGLE-AGENT (computationalist).** Needs physicist: physical interpretation of Airy kernel eigenvalue decay.

## §9. Critic Second-Agent Review
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-21 -->

**Numerics (§3-§5):** Accepted without re-running (relative diffs 1e-6, moments to 4 sig figs,
eigenvalue decay super-exponential). Standard Tracy-Widom benchmarks.

**Groupoid verdict (§6-§7): CONCUR with refinement.**

1. "Vacuously true but non-specific" — CORRECT. Pair groupoid ≠ monodromy groupoid.
2. Chain: monodromy data → RH correspondence → PII solution → K_Ai → det(1-K) = tau.
   Non-trivial content is in RH step, not in Fredholm expansion step. CORRECT.
3. Conjecture 6.1 (notebook) correctly labeled CONJECTURAL. BB1 effectively RESOLVES it:
   the conjecture is TRUE in a trivial sense and FALSE as a non-trivial groupoid claim.

**One refinement (sev-4):**
The Fredholm expansion sum_n (-1)^n/n! int det[K(x_i,x_j)] dx_1...dx_n is not JUST "any partition function" — for the Airy kernel it computes the gap probability P(no eigenvalues in [s,inf)) from random matrix theory. The n-point terms are inclusion-exclusion over the n-point correlation functions rho_n of the GUE edge ensemble. This physical content comes from the ensemble, not from groupoid theory, so the computationalist's verdict stands. But the "gap probability = Fredholm det" identity (Tracy-Widom 1993) is more informative than "generic partition function."

**No errors found. No missing steps. Logic is clean.**

**Verdict: CONCUR. TWO-AGENT (computationalist + critic).**

## §10. Mathematician Third-Agent Review
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-21 -->

**Numerics and verdict: CONCUR.** Pair groupoid interpretation vacuously true, no disagreement.

**Key mathematical refinement: the non-trivial groupoid IS the monodromy groupoid, but through RH.**

Chain (rigorous):
1. Monodromy groupoid \(\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{mon}}\): objects = singular pts of Lax connection on \(\mathbb{P}^1\); morphisms = Stokes multipliers \(S_k \in \mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{C})\). Composition = matrix product.
2. Riemann-Hilbert map: \(\mathrm{RH}: \mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{mon}} \to \mathcal{K}\) (space of integrable kernels). Injective (Birkhoff-Grothendieck).
3. Fredholm determinant: \(\det(1 - K) = \tau\).

Steps 1-2 = integrability content (\(I_{\mathrm{int}}\)). Step 3 = generic Fredholm theory.

**Assessment of Conjecture 6.1:**
- Trivially true as pair groupoid: YES (generic, no content).
- Non-trivially true as monodromy groupoid: PARTIALLY — the tau-function IS determined by monodromy data, but through the RH correspondence (analytic, not algebraic). The determinant formula \(\tau = \det(1-K)\) is NOT a "groupoid partition function" in the usual sense (sum over morphisms with weights). It is a DETERMINANT over a Hilbert space, related to monodromy data via RH.
- Corrected statement: "tau is a spectral invariant of the Fredholm operator determined by the monodromy groupoid via RH correspondence." Not "tau = groupoid partition function."

**What (C) buys:** Composition \(K(x,z) = \int K(x,y)K(y,z)dy\) is satisfied by trace-class integral operators (Fredholm theory). The Airy kernel IS a composition kernel in this sense. So (C) gives the Fredholm expansion — but not the SPECIFIC kernel.

**Open:** Is there a formula \(\tau = \sum_{\gamma \in \mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{mon}}} w(\gamma)\) as a genuine morphism sum? The Stokes multiplier product gives the total monodromy, not a sum. The closest is the **cluster expansion** of det(1-K) (Ruelle-Ginibre), but this sums over SUBSETS of a point process, not groupoid morphisms. DISTINCT.

**Verdict: Conjecture 6.1 RESOLVED — trivially true (pair groupoid), REFORMULATED (monodromy groupoid: spectral invariant via RH, not groupoid partition function). THREE-AGENT.**
