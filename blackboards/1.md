# Dualities as Refinement Equivalences
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S171

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 4 (after Remark 4.7 on asymptotic safety). The
paper discusses how different refinement schemes can produce different limits
(Example 3.1, Remark 3.2). Dualities show the complementary phenomenon: apparently
different theories (different "refinement procedures") produce the same physics.

## Key Claims

### Kramers-Wannier duality (1941)
2D Ising model at high temperature (β small) ↔ low temperature (β* = -½ ln tanh β).
Self-dual point β_c = β_c* locates the critical temperature exactly. Exchanges order
variable (spin σ) and disorder variable (domain wall μ).

### T-duality in string theory
String on circle of radius R gives same spectrum as radius α'/R, exchanging
momentum modes n ↔ winding modes w. Self-dual radius R = √α' is the string-scale
minimum. The refinement limit R→0 is equivalent to R→∞.

### Electric-magnetic (S-) duality
Montonen-Olive (1977): YM at coupling g ↔ dual theory at 1/g. In N=4 SYM, exact.
Seiberg-Witten (1994) in N=2: low-energy effective action determined by a curve
encoding both perturbative and non-perturbative physics.

### Connection to paper's themes
1. The "uncuttable" limit can be reached from multiple refinement directions
2. Self-dual points parallel the RG fixed points of Remark 4.6
3. UV/IR exchange under duality connects to asymptotic safety theme

## Proposed Remark
Remark 4.8 in uncuttable (after Remark 4.7, completing Section 4).
