# Asymptotic Safety: Non-Perturbative Refinement Limits
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S165

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 4 (after Remark 4.6 on conformal symmetry).
Remark 4.1 covers Wilson's RG, Remark 4.3 covers lattice gauge theory, Remark 4.6
covers conformal symmetry at fixed points. What's missing: the possibility that a UV
fixed point defines a non-perturbative continuum limit even for theories that are
perturbatively non-renormalizable — Weinberg's asymptotic safety program.

## Key Claims

### Asymptotic safety (Weinberg, 1979)
A quantum field theory is "asymptotically safe" if the RG flow approaches a non-trivial
UV fixed point (as opposed to the trivial Gaussian fixed point of asymptotic freedom).
At the fixed point, all essential couplings remain finite → the theory is UV complete
without new degrees of freedom, even if naive perturbation theory suggests non-
renormalizability.

### Application to gravity
The most prominent application: quantum gravity might be asymptotically safe. The
Einstein-Hilbert action is perturbatively non-renormalizable (Newton's constant has
mass dimension [G_N] = 2-d in d dimensions, relevant/dangerous in d=4). But functional
renormalization group (FRG) studies (Reuter, 1998) find evidence for a non-Gaussian UV
fixed point with a finite-dimensional critical surface — meaning only finitely many
parameters need to be measured, just as in renormalizable theories.

### Connection to paper's themes
1. Asymptotic safety is the most ambitious form of "uncuttable": the theory IS the
   fixed point, not any finite approximant
2. It extends Remark 4.1's Wilson framework beyond perturbative renormalizability
3. The critical surface dimension (number of relevant operators at the UV fixed point)
   determines the number of free parameters — the "extra data" needed to define the
   refinement limit
4. Contrast with string theory: there the UV completion comes from new degrees of
   freedom (strings); here it comes from the RG flow itself

## Proposed Remark
Remark 4.7 in uncuttable paper.
