# OQ-dS-3: Spatial a₂=0 on S³ vs Conformal Anomaly on S⁴

## §1. Setup

Two Euclidean formulations of de Sitter QFT for the half-density scalar:

| Formulation | Manifold | Topology | a₂(Δ_{1/2}) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lagrangian (instanton) | \(S^4\) | compact, round | \(-1/15\) |
| Hamiltonian (spatial) | \(S^3\) | spatial section | \(0\) |

From the closed-form (BB4, THREE-AGENT):
\[a_2(\Delta_{1/2}; S^d) = -\frac{d(d-1)(d-3)}{180}\]

\(S^4\): \(d=4\), \(a_2 = -12/180 = -1/15\).
\(S^3\): \(d=3\), \(a_2 = 0\) (from the \((d-3)\) factor).

## §2. The Lagrangian Side: Conformal Anomaly on \(S^4\)

In even \(d\), the trace anomaly \(\langle T^a{}_a \rangle\) is determined by \(a_{d/2}\).

On \(S^4\) (\(d=4\)): the relevant coefficient is \(a_2(\Delta_{1/2}; S^4) = -1/15\).

**Conformal anomaly** (Capper-Duff 1974, Duff 1994):
\[\langle T^a{}_a \rangle = \frac{1}{(4\pi)^2}\left(c\,C_{abcd}C^{abcd} - a\,E_4 + b\,\Box R\right)\]

For a scalar with \(\xi = 1/6\) (the composition-forced value):
- \(c = 1/120\), \(a = 1/360\), \(b = 1/180\) (standard).
- On \(S^4\) (conformally flat: \(C_{abcd} = 0\), \(E_4 = 24/a^4\), \(\Box R = 0\)):
\[\langle T^a{}_a \rangle_{S^4} = -\frac{1}{360}\cdot\frac{24}{(4\pi)^2 a^4} = -\frac{1}{240\pi^2 a^4}\]

This is NONZERO. The half-density scalar has a nontrivial 4D conformal anomaly on \(S^4\).

## §3. The Hamiltonian Side: Spatial Heat Kernel on \(S^3\)

The spatial Hamiltonian is \(H_{1/2} = \Delta_{1/2}|_{S^3}\) (the half-density Laplacian on the \(d=3\) spatial section).

Heat kernel expansion on \(S^3\):
\[\mathrm{tr}\,e^{-tH_{1/2}} = (4\pi t)^{-3/2}\left[\mathrm{Vol}(S^3) + 0\cdot t + 0\cdot t^2 + O(t^3)\right]\]

**Both \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) vanish.** The leading curvature correction is \(O(t^3)\) from \(a_3\).

Consequences for the Hamiltonian formulation:
1. **Casimir energy** on \(S^3\): no \(O(R)\) or \(O(R^2)\) corrections. Leading curvature correction at \(O(R^3)\).
2. **Spectral counting**: eigenvalue density follows the flat-space Weyl law up to \(O(t^2)\) corrections.
3. **Thermal partition function** \(Z(\beta) = \mathrm{tr}\,e^{-\beta H_{1/2}}\): no curvature corrections at \(O(\beta)\) or \(O(\beta^2)\).

## §4. Product vs Round: Why These Are Different

Key geometric point: \(S^4 \neq S^3 \times S^1\).

\(S^4\) (round): constant sectional curvature \(K = 1/a^2\), \(R = 12/a^2\).
\(S^3 \times S^1_\beta\): product metric, \(R = R_{S^3} + R_{S^1} = 6/a^2 + 0\).

For a product manifold \(M_1 \times M_2\):
- Riemann tensor has no cross components: \(R_{i\alpha j\beta} = 0\).
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_1 \times M_2) = V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_1) + V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_2)\) (BB5 Thm C5.1).
- But \(a_2\) is NOT additive: cross terms \(\propto R_1 R_2\), \(R_1 V_2\), \(V_1 V_2\) appear.

**However**, for \(S^3 \times S^1\):
- \(R(S^1) = 0\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^1) = 0\), \(R_{abcd}(S^1) = 0\).
- ALL cross terms vanish (every cross term involves at least one factor of \(R_2\), \(V_2\), or \(R_{2,abcd}\)).
- Therefore: \(a_2(S^3 \times S^1) = a_2(S^3) + a_2(S^1) = 0 + 0 = 0\).

**Result:** The thermal product geometry \(S^3 \times S^1\) has \(a_2 = 0\) (no conformal anomaly), while the instanton geometry \(S^4\) has \(a_2 = -1/15\) (nontrivial anomaly).

## §5. Physical Interpretation

### 5.1. Two Vacua, Two Anomalies

| | Thermal (S³×S¹) | Instanton (S⁴) |
|---|---|---|
| Topology | Product | Round |
| \(d_{\mathrm{eff}}\) | 3+1 (factored) | 4 (unified) |
| \(a_2\) | 0 | \(-1/15\) |
| Conformal anomaly | ABSENT | PRESENT |
| de Sitter interpretation | Static patch thermal state | Hartle-Hawking no-boundary |

### 5.2. The Half-Density "Protection" Is Spatial

The vanishing \(a_2(S^3) = 0\) protects the SPATIAL quantum mechanics from curvature corrections. In the Hamiltonian picture:
- The vacuum energy on \(S^3\) receives no \(R\) or \(R^2\) curvature renormalization.
- The spatial spectrum of \(H_{1/2}\) is maximally insensitive to the S³ curvature.

But the FULL 4D path integral on \(S^4\) is not a product — the time direction is curved too. The 4D trace anomaly arises from the full \(S^4\) geometry, which has curvature in all four directions simultaneously. No factorization into spatial + temporal is possible.

### 5.3. ADM Decomposition Perspective

In the ADM split \(M^4 = \mathbb{R} \times S^3\) with lapse \(N\) and shift \(N^i\):
- The 4D action decomposes into spatial + temporal pieces.
- For static dS₄: \(N = (1-H^2r^2)^{1/2}\), nontrivial lapse.
- The 4D conformal anomaly involves curvature of the FULL 4D geometry, including lapse gradients.

The spatial \(a_2 = 0\) means: the SPATIAL contribution to the 4D anomaly is zero. The nonzero 4D anomaly comes entirely from the "mixing" of spatial curvature with the nontrivial lapse/temporal structure.

**Slogan:** "Composition protects the spatial vacuum; spacetime curvature reintroduces the anomaly."

## §6. Limiting Cases and Checks

### 6.1. Flat limit (\(H \to 0\), \(a \to \infty\))

\(S^4 \to \mathbb{R}^4\): \(a_2 \to 0\) (flat space, no anomaly). CHECK.
\(S^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3\): \(a_2 \to 0\) (already zero). CHECK.

### 6.2. \(D = 3\) de Sitter (spatial section \(S^2\))

\(a_2(S^2) = -2\cdot1\cdot(-1)/180 = 1/90 \neq 0\).
Spatial quantum mechanics on \(S^2\) DOES have \(R^2\) corrections. The spatial protection is absent for \(D \neq 4\). CHECK: consistent with D=4 specialness.

### 6.3. \(D = 5\) de Sitter (spatial section \(S^4\))

\(a_2(S^4) = -1/15 \neq 0\).
Spatial quantum mechanics on \(S^4\) has curvature corrections. Again, no protection for \(D \neq 4\). CHECK.

## §7. The Dimensional Coincidence

Why is spatial \(a_2 = 0\) unique to \(D = 4\)?

Spacetime dimension \(D\), spatial dimension \(d = D-1\):
\[a_2(\Delta_{1/2}; S^{D-1}) = -\frac{(D-1)(D-2)(D-4)}{180}\]

Vanishes iff \(D \in \{1, 2, 4\}\). Only \(D = 4\) is nontrivial.

This is the SAME \((d-3)\) factor as before (\(d = D-1\), so \(d-3 = D-4\)).

**Summary:** Among de Sitter spacetimes \(\mathrm{dS}_D\) for \(D \geq 3\):
- Only in \(D = 4\) does the half-density scalar on the spatial section have \(a_2 = 0\).
- Only in \(D = 4\) is the spatial vacuum maximally insensitive to curvature.
- The 4D conformal anomaly on the full \(S^4\) is nonzero, arising from the non-factorizable spacetime geometry.

## §8. Connection to the D=4 Coincidence Table

This gives a more refined version of coincidence (v):

| # | Coincidence | Type |
|---|---|---|
| (v-refined) | Spatial \(a_2(S^{D-1}) = 0\) iff \(D = 4\); spatial vacuum protected from \(R^2\) corrections | Heat kernel + ADM |
| (v-contrast) | Full \(a_2(S^D) \neq 0\) for \(d = D \geq 2\); 4D conformal anomaly survives | Lagrangian |

The protection is SPATIAL, not spacetime. Composition shields the Hamiltonian formulation but not the Lagrangian instanton path integral. This is physically sensible: composition is a property of TEMPORAL evolution (sewing propagators in time), hence it naturally constrains the SPATIAL operator.

## §9. Open Questions

**OQ-dS-3a.** On \(S^3 \times S^1_\beta\): the conformal anomaly vanishes for ALL \(\beta\) (not just \(\beta_{\mathrm{GH}}\)). Does this mean the half-density scalar is conformally anomaly-free in the thermal state of any static spacetime with \(S^3\) spatial sections?

**OQ-dS-3b.** For Schwarzschild-de Sitter (spatial section = \(S^2\) topology but not round): \(a_2(S^2_{\mathrm{SdS}}) \neq 0\) because \(a_2\) depends on local curvature, not just topology. But is the INTEGRATED \(A_2 = \int a_2\,\mathrm{dvol}\) nonzero?

**OQ-dS-3c.** Does the spatial protection extend to fermionic fields? For a Dirac fermion with half-density normalization, what is \(a_2(\Delta_{1/2}^{\mathrm{Dirac}}; S^3)\)?

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (physicist). Needs 2nd agent for review.**

## §10. ALL Heat Kernel Coefficients Vanish on \(S^3\)
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-22 -->

### §10.1. The Kluth-Litim Generating Function

For a scalar \(P = -\Delta + E\) on \(S^d\), the integrated heat kernel coefficients are (eq. 30 of [KL2020]):
\[
b_{2n}^{(0)}(\bar{E}) = \frac{\Gamma(1-d/2)}{\Gamma(1+n-d/2)}\left(\frac{R}{d(d-1)}\right)^n \kappa_n(d)
\]

where \(\bar{E} = \frac{1-d}{4d}R\) is the "special endomorphism" and \(\kappa_n(d)\) is generated by:
\[
\exp\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n(2n+1)}B_{2n+1}\!\left(\tfrac{d-1}{2}\right)z^n = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\kappa_n(d)\,z^n
\]

with \(B_{2n+1}\) the Bernoulli polynomials.

### §10.2. The Key Identity at \(d = 3\)

At \(d = 3\): \(\frac{d-1}{2} = 1\).

**Standard identity:** \(B_{2n+1}(1) = 0\) for all \(n \geq 1\).
- \(B_3(1) = 1 - 3/2 + 1/2 = 0\). CHECK.
- \(B_5(1) = 1 - 5/2 + 5/3 - 1/6 = 0\). CHECK.
- General: \(B_k(1) = (-1)^k B_k\), and \(B_{2n+1} = 0\) for \(n \geq 1\).

Therefore the generating function exponent = 0, so \(\kappa_n(3) = \delta_{n,0}\).

### §10.3. The Half-Density Connection

The "special endomorphism" at \(d = 3\):
\[\bar{E} = \frac{1-3}{4\cdot 3}R = -\frac{R}{6}\]

This IS \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) (the half-density potential in RNC; on \(S^3\), the RNC value = global value because \(S^3 \cong \mathrm{SU}(2)\) is a Lie group).

**The Kluth-Litim "special endomorphism" and the composition-forced half-density potential are the SAME mathematical object.**

### §10.4. The Result

**Theorem (all-\(a_k\) vanishing).** For the half-density Laplacian \(\Delta_{1/2}\) on \(S^3\):
\[
a_k(\Delta_{1/2}; S^3) = 0 \qquad \forall\, k \geq 1.
\]

Consequently:
\[
\mathrm{tr}\,e^{-t\Delta_{1/2}} = (4\pi t)^{-3/2}\,\mathrm{Vol}(S^3) \qquad \text{exactly, for all } t > 0.
\]

The half-density scalar on \(S^3\) has the SAME heat trace as the flat-space Laplacian on a domain of equal volume. The \(S^3\) curvature is completely invisible to the short-time expansion.

### §10.5. Verification Against Known Results

| \(k\) | \(a_k\) from Kluth-Litim | From Thm M4.1 / BB4 | Match |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | \(\kappa_0 = 1\) → \(a_0 = 1\) | \(a_0 = 1\) (universal) | YES |
| 1 | \(\kappa_1 = 0\) → \(a_1 = 0\) | Thm M4.1 (universal) | YES |
| 2 | \(\kappa_2 = 0\) → \(a_2 = 0\) | \(-d(d-1)(d-3)/180 = 0\) at \(d=3\) | YES |
| \(\geq 3\) | \(\kappa_k = 0\) → \(a_k = 0\) | NEW (not previously known) | — |

### §10.6. Physical Interpretation

**10.6.1 "Heat-kernel flatness."** The half-density Laplacian on \(S^3\) is spectrally indistinguishable from a flat Laplacian in the heat kernel sense. All local curvature information encoded in the \(a_k\) is exactly cancelled by the half-density potential \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\).

**10.6.2 Spectral vs heat kernel.** The SPECTRUM is not flat: eigenvalues are \((l+1)^2 - 2\), not the flat-space spectrum. The heat kernel coefficients are moments of the spectral measure, and the curvature effects on individual eigenvalues cancel in these moments.

**10.6.3 One-loop effective action.** On \(S^3\), the one-loop effective action of the half-density scalar has NO curvature-dependent divergences at ANY order. All UV divergences are "volume-type" (proportional to \(\mathrm{Vol}(S^3)\) only). No \(R\), \(R^2\), \(R^3\), ... counterterms are needed.

**10.6.4 Strengthened spatial protection.** §§1-8 showed \(a_1 = a_2 = 0\) (no \(R\) or \(R^2\) corrections). This result shows: ALL curvature corrections vanish. The spatial vacuum is not just protected at leading orders — it is EXACTLY flat in the heat-kernel sense.

### §10.7. Why \(d = 3\) Is Special (Again)

The \(\kappa_n(d) = \delta_{n,0}\) result is specific to \(d = 3\), via \(B_{2n+1}(1) = 0\). For other dimensions:
- \(d = 2\): \(B_{2n+1}(1/2) \neq 0\) generically, so \(\kappa_n(2) \neq 0\).
- \(d = 4\): \(B_{2n+1}(3/2) \neq 0\) generically, so \(\kappa_n(4) \neq 0\).
- \(d = 5\): \(B_{2n+1}(2) = B_{2n+1}\) (Bernoulli numbers), zero for \(n \geq 1\)? NO: \(B_{2n+1}(2) = B_{2n+1}(0) + (2n+1)B_{2n}(0) + \ldots\). Need explicit check.

**The "heat-kernel flatness" of the half-density Laplacian is a \(d = 3\) phenomenon.** This is a SIXTH independent D=4 coincidence (spatial \(d = D-1 = 3\)).

### §10.8. Open Questions

**OQ-dS-4.** Does the all-\(a_k\) vanishing extend to other 3-manifolds? On a general \((M^3, g)\): \(a_1 = 0\) is universal (Thm M4.1). \(a_2 = 0\) requires special curvature conditions. All \(a_k = 0\) likely requires constant curvature (the Kluth-Litim formula is specific to \(S^d\)). **Conjecture: heat-kernel flatness is specific to \(S^3\) (and \(\mathbb{R}^3\)).**

**OQ-dS-5.** Is the Kluth-Litim "special endomorphism" = V_HD connection known in the literature? The coincidence \(\bar{E} = V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) seems to be a new observation. Kluth-Litim chose \(\bar{E}\) for computational convenience; we derive it from composition. Same object, different origins.

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (physicist). High priority for 2nd-agent verification (computationalist: check κ_n(3) numerically; mathematician: verify Bernoulli identity).**
