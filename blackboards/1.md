# Asymptotic Expansions and Optimal Truncation

Cycle: S138

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 2. Remarks 2.2-2.4 cover polynomial counterterm towers (convergent). Remark 2.5 covers Padé/Borel resummation (divergent). This blackboard studies the intermediate concept: asymptotic expansions with optimal truncation, which bridges the two regimes.

## Key Claims

### Poincaré asymptotic expansions (1886)
A formal series Σ a_n x^n is asymptotic to f(x) as x → 0+ if for every N:
  f(x) - Σ_{n=0}^{N} a_n x^n = O(x^{N+1}).

The defining property is that the partial sums approximate f(x) to any fixed order in x, even if the series diverges (a_n can grow factorially). The canonical example: the exponential integral E₁(x) = ∫_x^∞ (e^{-t}/t) dt has the asymptotic expansion
  E₁(x) ~ e^{-x}/x · Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n n!/x^n    (x → ∞)
with factorially growing coefficients — the series diverges for all x.

### Optimal truncation
For an asymptotic series with |a_n| ~ C n! / ρ^n (factorial growth), the n-th term at argument x has size ~ C (n!/ρ^n) x^n. This is minimized when n ≈ ρ/x (Stirling approximation). Truncating at N_opt ≈ ρ/x — the smallest term — gives an approximation with error exponentially small:
  |error| ~ exp(-ρ/x).

This is sometimes called "superasymptotic" approximation (Berry, 1991). The exponentially small remainder is real and physical — it contains non-perturbative information (e.g., instantons, tunneling amplitudes) that no finite truncation of the asymptotic series can capture.

### Connection to Borel resummation
The exponentially small remainder at optimal truncation is precisely what Borel resummation recovers. The Borel transform B(t) = Σ (a_n/n!) t^n has a singularity at t = ρ (related to the nearest instanton action). The Borel integral ∫_0^∞ e^{-t/x} B(t) dt captures this non-perturbative content — the exponentially small terms ~exp(-ρ/x) arise from the behavior of B(t) near its singularity.

When B(t) has singularities on the positive real axis (Stokes phenomenon), the Borel integral requires a contour prescription — lateral Borel summation or median summation. This ambiguity is resolved by additional physical data (e.g., the choice of vacuum, boundary conditions), exactly the "control data" theme of Section 4.

### Dingle's terminant analysis (1973)
Dingle showed that the late terms of an asymptotic expansion encode information about other saddle points (instantons). The ratio a_{n+1}/a_n → 1/ρ (the nearest singularity) controls the divergence rate. The "resurgent" structure — where the coefficients of one saddle-point expansion encode the existence and action of other saddles — was formalized by Écalle (1981) as resurgence theory.

### The "uncuttable" message
Optimal truncation demonstrates the "uncuttable" theme precisely:
1. Each finite truncation N is a valid "cut" — a finite approximation with controlled error O(x^{N+1}).
2. The best such cut (N = N_opt) achieves exponential accuracy but can go no further.
3. The full answer requires going beyond any finite cut — the non-perturbative remainder is part of the definition of the function.
4. The Borel resummation (Remark 2.5) is the systematic procedure that recovers this beyond-all-orders content.

This forms a clean bridge: Remarks 2.2-2.4 (convergent towers) → optimal truncation (best finite cut) → Remark 2.5 (Borel resummation for the non-perturbative remainder).

## Proposed Remark
Could go between Remarks 2.4 and 2.5 — but inserting would renumber. Better to add as Remark 2.6 after 2.5, completing the picture: "Remark 2.6 (Optimal truncation: the exponential accuracy barrier)." Content: asymptotic series with factorial growth, optimal truncation at N ~ ρ/x gives exp(-ρ/x) error, this exponentially small remainder is precisely what Borel resummation recovers — the non-perturbative "shadow" that no finite cut captures.
