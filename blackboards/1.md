# Anomalous Magnetic Moment: Precision Test of Fermion Loops
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S159

## Context
Target: fermionic mediators paper, Section 3 (after Remark 3.3 on Schwinger/EH) or Section 6.
The paper discusses vacuum polarization (Section 3.1) and Schwinger pair production (Remark 3.3) as ways fermions affect electromagnetic interactions. The anomalous magnetic moment g-2 is the most precisely tested prediction in all of physics, and it directly involves a fermion (vertex) loop correction.

## Key Claims

### Schwinger's result (1948)
The leading quantum correction to the electron's magnetic moment comes from a single vertex diagram: a virtual photon emitted and reabsorbed by the electron line. The result:

  a_e = (g-2)/2 = α/(2π) ≈ 0.001161...

where α ≈ 1/137 is the fine-structure constant. This was calculated by Schwinger in 1948 — the same year as his pair-production calculation.

### Higher-order corrections
The anomalous magnetic moment has been computed to 5th order in α (10th order in perturbation theory):

  a_e = α/(2π) - 0.328...(α/π)² + 1.181...(α/π)³ - 1.912...(α/π)⁴ + ...

The experimental value agrees with theory to about 12 significant digits — the most precise test of QED and arguably of any physical theory.

### Connection to the paper's themes

1. **Fermion loop effect**: The leading correction is a vertex correction involving one virtual photon loop on the fermion line. Higher orders involve vacuum polarization (fermion loops in the photon propagator — Section 3.1's topic) and light-by-light scattering (the same fermion box diagram topology as the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian of Remark 3.3).

2. **Contact expansion**: At low momentum transfer, the vertex correction generates an effective magnetic interaction that is the anomalous magnetic moment — a dimension-5 operator σ^μν F_μν in the EFT language. This is the magnetic analog of the electric contact expansion in Section 4.

3. **Running coupling connection**: The vacuum polarization contribution to g-2 (at higher orders) probes the running coupling of Section 3.1 in a complementary way to the Uehling potential of Example 3.2.

4. **Muon g-2**: The muon anomalous magnetic moment is more sensitive to heavy physics (by a factor of (m_μ/m_e)²) and currently shows a ~4σ discrepancy between experiment (Fermilab g-2) and some Standard Model predictions — potentially the strongest hint of new physics beyond the Standard Model. This sensitivity to heavy degrees of freedom connects to the EFT framework: new physics at scale Λ contributes δa_μ ~ m_μ²/Λ², exactly the dimension-5 operator suppression pattern.

### Structural point for the paper
The anomalous magnetic moment is the quintessential example of "fermions affect electromagnetic properties through quantum loops." The vertex correction, vacuum polarization, and light-by-light contributions organize by loop order — exactly the perturbative tower discussed in Section 3.

## Proposed Remark
Remark 3.4 (or new position after Remark 3.3) in fermionic Section 3.
Content: Schwinger's a_e = α/(2π) as the leading vertex correction. Higher orders involve vacuum polarization (Section 3.1) and light-by-light (Remark 3.3). Agreement to 12 significant digits. Muon g-2 discrepancy as sensitivity to heavy-fermion loop effects, connecting to EFT operator suppression.
