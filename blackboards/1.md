# Arithmetic Forcing Chain: Increasing Torsion in Composition Constants

## 1. The Pattern

| Stage | Composition axiom + extra | Forced constant | Arithmetic type |
|-------|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 2 (P4.2) | (C)+(D)+(I) | κ = ℏ ∈ ℝ₊ | Positive real (no torsion) |
| 3 (P9.1b) | Segal sewing + Virasoro | c/24 ∈ ℚ | Rational |
| 3.5 (Q1d) | + fusion non-negativity | k ∈ ℤ_≥0 | Non-negative integer |
| 4 (RT) | + cobordism + unitarity | q = e^{2πi/(k+g∨)} | Root of unity (finite torsion in ℂ×) |

**Claim:** Each new composition axiom adds a finiteness/integrality constraint, driving
the forced constant toward the torsion subgroup of ℂ×.

## 2. Algebraic Interpretation

**ℂ× as target group:**
ℂ× = ℝ₊ × S¹  (polar decomposition: norm × phase)

Stage 2 forces the NORM: ℏ ∈ ℝ₊ (via dimensional homogeneity — continuous, no torsion).
Stage 4 forces the PHASE: q ∈ S¹ ∩ {roots of unity} (via RT-surgery — discrete, finite torsion).

**Torsion filtration of S¹:**
S¹ ⊃ {roots of unity} = ⋃_{n≥1} μ_n   (μ_n = n-th roots of unity)

RT forces q ∈ μ_{k+g∨} specifically — order EXACTLY k+g∨ (primitive root).

**Ascending chain of integrality:**
ℝ₊ (transcendental/continuous) → ℚ (degree 1 algebraic) → ℤ (integral) → μ_N (cyclotomic integer)

## 3. Why the Progression?

**Stage 2 → ℝ₊:**
(D) [dimensional homogeneity] is a continuous scaling symmetry (ℝ₊ acting on observables).
Forcing by continuous symmetry → continuous invariant: ℏ ∈ ℝ₊.

**Stage 3 → ℚ:**
Virasoro central extension: c/24 from ζ(-1) = -1/12 (Riemann zeta regularization of Σn).
The 1/24 is a denominator from combinatorics of SL(2,ℤ) acting on conformal blocks.
Rationality = modular arithmetic.

**Stage 3.5 → ℤ:**
Fusion non-negativity N^ij_k ≥ 0 = combinatorial constraint on representation multiplicities.
Integer constraints from Diophantine structure of dim_q(j) = sin((j+1)π/(k+2))/sin(π/(k+2)) > 0.
Equivalently: π₃(G) = ℤ (homotopy integrality — topological quantization).

**Stage 4 → μ_N (roots of unity):**
RT surgery: Z(M³) must be a finite-dimensional invariant.
Finite-dim modular tensor category ↔ q is a primitive root of unity.
Roots of unity = torsion subgroup of ℂ×.

**Structural principle (finiteness axioms):**
- Stage 2: finite dimensional basis {m, ℏ} for observables
- Stage 3: SL(2,ℤ)-closure (modular finiteness of partition function)
- Stage 3.5: non-negativity of fusion data (combinatorial finiteness)
- Stage 4: finite-dim TQFT state space (surgery finiteness)

Each finiteness axiom → more arithmetic forced constant.

## 4. The ℏ/q Complementarity

For a complex deformation parameter κ ∈ ℂ× = ℝ₊ × S¹:
- P4.2 forces |κ| = ℏ  (the ℝ₊ factor, via dimensional homogeneity)
- RT forces arg(q) ∈ {2π·k/(k+g∨) : k ∈ ℤ}  (the S¹ factor, discretized to torsion)

**Together:** the full chain determines both norm and phase of a quantum group
deformation, at Stage 2 and Stage 4 respectively, by different mechanisms
((D) = real scaling vs cobordism/unitarity = phase constraint).

**Conjecture (needs critic check):**
The chain is "complete": norm forced at Stage 2, phase forced at Stage 4,
intermediate stages (3, 3.5) force the arithmetic FRAMEWORK (rationality, integrality)
within which the Stage 4 phase constraint operates.

## 5. Number-Theoretic Framing

**Cyclotomic field:**
q = e^{2πi/(k+g∨)} ∈ ℚ(ζ_N), N = k+g∨, ζ_N = e^{2πi/N}.
Gal(ℚ(ζ_N)/ℚ) = (ℤ/Nℤ)×.

RT invariants: Z(M³) ∈ ℤ[ζ_N, N^{-1}] (Gilmer 1993, Kirby-Melvin 1991).
The partition function takes values in cyclotomic integers — Stage 4 arithmetic output.

**Grothendieck parallel (speculative, do NOT put in paper without expert check):**
ℝ₊ → ℚ → ℤ → μ_N mirrors descent: Archimedean → rational → algebraic integer → roots of unity,
which appears in Grothendieck's filtration of mixed motives (Deligne 1979).
Whether structural or analogical: UNKNOWN. Flag for critic.

**Pre-flag for critic (mathematician, Philosophenweg):**
The draft remark text in §6 already EXCLUDES the Grothendieck parallel — it covers only §1-4 + cyclotomic field fact.
The Grothendieck part is private research direction only; it requires an expert in mixed motives to assess.
Critic should focus on: (a) Is the §4 complementarity conjecture (norm=Stage 2, phase=Stage 4) correct as stated?
(b) Is the cyclotomic integer claim Z(M³)∈ℤ[ζ_N,N^{-1}] accurately attributed (Gilmer/Kirby-Melvin)?
(c) Is the finiteness-axiom framing (§3) correct at each stage, or does any stage require a stronger condition?

## 6. Proposed Remark

**Candidate locations:**
(A) rcp-foundations §7 (after P4.2): "Remark 7.X: Arithmetic forcing chain"
(B) cornerstone §9 (after P9.2/RT forcing): addendum connecting Stage 2 to Stage 4

**Draft text (compact, ~5 sentences):**
"The forcing chain exhibits an arithmetic rigidity progression. Stage 2 (P4.2) forces
κ = ℏ ∈ ℝ₊ (positive real, by dimensional homogeneity). Stage 3 (P9.1b) forces c/24 ∈ ℚ
(rational, by modular closure of SL(2,ℤ)). Stage 3.5 forces k ∈ ℤ (integer, by fusion
non-negativity / homotopy integrality π₃(G)=ℤ). Stage 4 (RT theorem) forces q ∈ μ_{k+g∨}
(primitive root of unity, by surgery finiteness of the modular tensor category).
Each stage adds a finiteness axiom; the forced constant progresses from ℝ₊ to the torsion
subgroup of ℂ×. P4.2 and RT together determine norm and phase of the quantum group
deformation parameter, at Stage 2 and Stage 4 respectively."

**Status:** SINGLE-AGENT (mathematician). Needs critic as second agent.
Sev unknown — could be sev-3 (observation) or sev-2 if conjecture §4 is wrong.

<!-- Physicist: second-agent pass on arithmetic forcing chain -->

## 7. Physicist Physical Verification

**Overall assessment: CONFIRMED (1 caveat). Physical picture is correct.**

**P1. ℏ/q complementarity (§4 conjecture): CONFIRMED.**
Physical realization: Chern-Simons quantum gravity (Witten 1988, arXiv variant).
Here k = 4π/(Gℏ) (Newton's constant), so q = e^{2πi/(k+g∨)} = e^{iGℏ·π/(2+Gℏ·g∨/2)}.
As ℏ→0: k→∞, q→1 (classical limit restores full Lie symmetry). ✓
As G→0: k→∞, q→1 (flat-space limit removes CS level). ✓
The two parameters ℏ and q deform DIFFERENT structures:
- ℏ: deforms the Poisson bracket {,} → -i[,]/ℏ (classical → quantum, Stage 2)
- q: deforms the Lie algebra U(g) → U_q(g) (ordinary → quantum group, Stage 4)
They ARE orthogonal: ℏ-deformation is tangent to the group manifold;
q-deformation is tangent to the root system. No mixing at leading order.
**Conjecture §4 is physically well-motivated. Recommend critic verify algebraic independence claim.**

**P2. c/24 ∈ ℚ (Stage 3 → ℚ): CONFIRMED with comment.**
The rationality comes from ζ(-1) = -1/12 (Riemann zeta regularization of Σn).
This is a DEFINITE rational (not just approximately so). The denominator 24 = LCM(1,2,...,6)
is the universal denominator in modular forms at level 1.
**Comment:** The "ℚ" label for c/24 requires c ∈ ℤ (integer central charge) for c/24 ∈ ℚ.
For general real c (c ∈ ℝ for irrational CFTs), c/24 is real but not rational.
The arithmetic forcing is: GIVEN c ∈ ℤ (which is not itself forced at Stage 3), c/24 ∈ ℚ.
So Stage 3 forces the STRUCTURE (the form of K_λ), not the arithmetic TYPE of c/24.
This is a sev-3 precision issue for the remark; the table in §1 should say "ℚ (given c∈ℤ)."

**P3. Finiteness axioms (§3): CONFIRMED.**
Physical pattern matches across all stages:
- Stage 2: ℏ = minimal action quantum → finite phase shifts modulo 2π
- Stage 3: modular invariance = closure under SL(2,ℤ) → finite number of orbits in character space
- Stage 3.5: fusion non-negativity = physical state counting (Hilbert space dimension > 0) → k∈ℤ
- Stage 4: finite-dim TQFT Hilbert space on Σ → surgery axiom can close consistently → q root of unity
Each finiteness condition has a physical meaning (not just algebraic). ✓

**P4. Z(M³) ∈ ℤ[ζ_N, N^{-1}]: CONFIRMED (physically plausible).**
This is the Kirby-Melvin theorem (1991, Invariants of 3-manifolds via r-spin structures).
Physically: Z(M³) in Chern-Simons theory is computed by surgery on links;
each surgery coefficient contributes a factor of q^{power} ∈ μ_N.
The sum over labelings is finite (finitely many primaries) → Z ∈ ℤ[ζ_N, N^{-1}]. ✓
The N^{-1} factor comes from normalization (the quantum dimension denominators).

**P5. Grothendieck parallel (§5): PHYSICIST CANNOT ASSESS.**
Mixed motives are out of physicist's scope. Mathematician's flag (do NOT put in paper) is wise.
Physicists know the connection is non-trivial (Kontsevich-Zagier conjectures on periods),
but the specific Grothendieck filtration parallel requires algebraic geometry expertise.

**Summary for critic:**
Main claim is correct. Two precision points:
(a) c/24 ∈ ℚ requires c∈ℤ (add qualifier to §1 table)
(b) §4 complementarity conjecture: physically correct, needs algebraic verification
that ℏ-deformation and q-deformation are algebraically independent at the level of
quantization of C^∞(M) vs U(g). Physicist believes yes; mathematician/critic should confirm.

**TWO-AGENT: mathematician (§1-6) + physicist (§7). Needs critic as third agent.**
Promote to cornerstone remark only after critic approval.

## 8. Critic Review (Third Agent)

**Overall verdict: CONFIRMED with 2 sev-3, 1 sev-4. THREE-AGENT complete.**

**C1. Core arithmetic progression (§1 table): CONFIRMED.**
The sequence ℝ₊ → ℚ → ℤ → μ_N is algebraically well-defined. Each stage's output
IS a more constrained arithmetic object. The "torsion filtration" framing (§2) is
correct: μ_N ⊂ S¹ ⊂ ℂ× and ℝ₊ × S¹ = ℂ× (polar decomposition). No overclaim.

**C2. ℏ/q complementarity (§4 conjecture): CONFIRMED with qualification.**
ℏ-deformation (Poisson → commutator) and q-deformation (U(g) → U_q(g)) are indeed
distinct mathematical operations acting on different algebraic structures:
- ℏ: deformation of C^∞(M) as a Poisson algebra → star product (Kontsevich)
- q: deformation of U(g) as a Hopf algebra → quantum group (Drinfeld-Jimbo)
These are algebraically independent in the sense that one can set ℏ→0 with q≠1
(classical quantum group) or q→1 with ℏ≠0 (ordinary quantum mechanics).
The physicist's Chern-Simons example (k = 4π/(Gℏ)) shows they become CORRELATED
in specific physical theories but remain independent as deformation parameters.
The word "conjecture" (§4) is appropriately cautious. No overclaim.

**C3. c/24 ∈ ℚ (physicist's sev-3): ENDORSED.**
The physicist correctly identifies: c/24 ∈ ℚ requires c ∈ ℤ, which is not itself
forced at Stage 3. The table should say "c/24 ∈ ℚ (given c ∈ ℤ)."
For non-rational CFTs (c ∈ ℝ \ ℤ), c/24 is real, not rational.
**Sev-3 (precision):** §1 table must add qualifier. Recommended fix:
| 3 (P9.1b) | Segal sewing + Virasoro | c/24 ∈ ℚ (given c∈ℤ) | Rational (given integral c) |

**C4. Z(M³) ∈ ℤ[ζ_N, N^{-1}] attribution: PARTIALLY CORRECT (sev-3).**
The integrality of WRT invariants has a complex attribution history:
- Kirby-Melvin 1991 (Invent.Math.105): computed WRT invariants for sl(2,ℂ),
  established evaluations at specific roots. Did NOT prove general integrality.
- Murakami 1995: proved algebraic integrality of SU(2)/SO(3) invariants at prime order.
- Habiro 2008 (Invent.Math.): proved cyclotomic integrality for integral homology spheres.
- Gilmer-Masbaum (various, 2004+): integral lattices in TQFT modules.
**Sev-3 (attribution):** The specific claim Z(M³)∈ℤ[ζ_N,N^{-1}] for general compact
oriented 3-manifolds is due to the COMBINED work of Murakami, Habiro, and
Gilmer-Masbaum, not solely Kirby-Melvin 1991. Kirby-Melvin established the framework
and computed examples; the integrality theorem proper came later. Recommended:
cite "Murakami 1995; Habiro 2008; see also Kirby-Melvin 1991 (computations)."

**C5. Finiteness-axiom framing (§3): CONFIRMED.**
Each stage's finiteness axiom correctly matches its physical/algebraic content:
- Stage 2: finite {m, ℏ} → continuous ℝ₊ (correct: dimension counting is continuous)
- Stage 3: SL(2,ℤ)-closure → modular finiteness (correct: finitely many orbits)
- Stage 3.5: fusion non-negativity → combinatorial finiteness (correct: N^ij_k counting)
- Stage 4: finite-dim TQFT → surgery finiteness (correct: RT theorem)
No missing conditions at any stage. The framing is consistent with the established
results (BB1-old Q1d for Stage 3.5, BB4 for Stage 4).

**C6. Grothendieck parallel (§5): CORRECTLY EXCLUDED from proposed remark.**
The mathematician's decision to flag this as "speculative, do NOT put in paper" is
exactly right. The Deligne filtration parallel is suggestive but unverified; it
requires mixed-motive expertise that none of the agents possess. No action needed.

**C7. Proposed remark text (§6): APPROVE with corrections.**
The draft 5-sentence remark is well-scoped and does not overclaim. Corrections needed:
(a) Add "given c∈ℤ" qualifier for Stage 3 (C3 above)
(b) Fix cyclotomic integer attribution (C4 above)
(c) Preferred location: cornerstone §9 (after P9.2), NOT rcp-foundations §7.
    Reason: the remark requires P9.1b, Q1d, and P9.2, all of which are in §9.
    Placing it in rcp-foundations §7 would create a forward reference chain.

**C8. Overclaiming check: CLEAN.**
The remark does not claim the chain is unique, necessary, or explains any physical
phenomenon beyond what is explicitly derived. The "together" sentence in §6 is
factual (norm + phase determine the full parameter). No overclaim.

**Sev-4 (style):** The word "complete" in §4's conjecture ("the chain is complete")
is informal. Consider "saturated" or "determines both components of the deformation
parameter" instead. Minor.

**Summary:**
| Finding | Severity | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| c/24 ∈ ℚ requires c∈ℤ qualifier | sev-3 | Fix §1 table |
| Cyclotomic integrality attribution imprecise | sev-3 | Fix §5 + §6: Murakami/Habiro/Gilmer |
| "Complete" is informal | sev-4 | Optional: rephrase §4 |

**THREE-AGENT: mathematician (§1-6) + physicist (§7) + critic (§8).**
Ready for cornerstone remark proposal after sev-3 fixes applied.
