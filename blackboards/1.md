# Wilson's Renormalization Group: Systematic Refinement Management
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S142

## Context
Target: uncuttable paper, Section 4 (Outlook). Currently only 7 lines describing the "extra structure" pattern. Wilson's RG provides the definitive framework for understanding refinement limits: the blocking transformation is literally a refinement map, and the RG flow organizes how effective descriptions change under scale transformation.

## Key Claims

### Wilson's blocking transformation
Consider a lattice field theory with lattice spacing a. Wilson's RG (1971, 1974):
1. **Integrate out** short-distance degrees of freedom between scales a and 2a (block spin transformation).
2. **Rescale** coordinates so the new lattice spacing is again a.
3. **Renormalize** the effective couplings to absorb the integrated-out physics.

The map T: (coupling space at scale a) → (coupling space at scale 2a) is the RG transformation. The continuum limit a → 0 corresponds to finding a fixed point T* of this map, where the effective theory is scale-invariant.

### Fixed points and universality
The RG fixed points organize the space of possible continuum limits:
- **Gaussian fixed point**: free (non-interacting) theory. Relevant for d > 4 (φ⁴ theory).
- **Wilson-Fisher fixed point**: interacting, controls the d=3 critical behavior. Universal: all systems with the same symmetry and dimensionality flow to the same fixed point, regardless of microscopic details.

The relevant/irrelevant classification:
- **Relevant** operators grow under RG flow → must be tuned to reach the fixed point (these are the "renormalized parameters").
- **Irrelevant** operators shrink → their effects vanish in the continuum limit (universality).
- **Marginal** operators: logarithmic running, require perturbative analysis (asymptotic freedom, etc.).

### Connection to the paper's "uncuttable" theme
Wilson's RG is the definitive answer to "what controls refinement limits":

1. **The refinement rule IS the blocking transformation.** Different ways of integrating out short-distance modes (momentum shell, real space, etc.) give different RG maps, but the fixed points (continuum limits) are the same — refinement-scheme independence, the "uncuttable" condition.

2. **The counterterms ARE the relevant operators.** The counterterm tower of Section 2 (Remarks 2.2–2.6) is the perturbative shadow of Wilson's RG: each counterterm absorbs the divergence from integrating out one more shell of modes.

3. **The control data ARE the couplings.** Example 3.1's α-ordering and Remark 3.2's Itô/Stratonovich choice are "marginal" parameters — they specify which continuum limit is selected from a family of fixed points, just as Wilson's couplings do.

4. **Universality IS refinement compatibility.** The statement that the continuum limit depends only on relevant couplings (not lattice details) is the precise version of "the limit object is independent of the finite dissection scheme" (Section 1, condition 3).

### The continuum limit as a fixed point
The deepest message: a well-defined QFT is not "what you get when the lattice spacing goes to zero." It is the fixed point of the RG flow — a self-consistent definition that makes no reference to any particular lattice or cutoff. The "uncuttable" character of the continuum theory is not that it is indivisible, but that it is the stable target of the refinement flow: no finite lattice is the theory, but the theory is the limit toward which all lattices flow.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 4.1, in Section 4 (Outlook), expanding the "renormalization" bullet point.

Content: Wilson's renormalization group as the systematic framework for managing refinement limits. The blocking transformation is the refinement map, fixed points define the continuum limit, and universality expresses refinement-scheme independence. The counterterm tower of Section 2 is the perturbative shadow of this structure.
