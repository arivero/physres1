# Aharonov-Bohm Effect
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S167

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 5 (after Remark 5.3 on energy-time uncertainty).
The paper discusses Berry phase (via uncuttable Remark 3.5) and geometric quantization
(Remark 7.5). The Aharonov-Bohm effect is the paradigmatic example of a geometric/
topological phase that directly illustrates the action-angle framework: the gauge potential
A shifts the canonical momentum, modifying the action integral ∮ p·dq = ∮ (mv+eA)·dq
and thereby the phase accumulated around a closed path.

## Key Claims

### Aharonov-Bohm (1959)
A charged particle passing around a solenoid acquires a phase shift
Δφ = eΦ/ℏ where Φ = ∮ A·dl is the magnetic flux through the solenoid,
even though B=0 everywhere outside the solenoid (the particle never enters
a region with nonzero field).

### Connection to paper's themes
1. The AB phase is an action-variable shift: the canonical momentum is p = mv + eA,
   so ∮ p·dq picks up an extra eΦ compared to free motion
2. The quantization condition ∮ p·dq = nh for bound states becomes modified by the
   flux, shifting the spectrum by eΦ/(2πℏ)
3. This is a topological/geometric phase: it depends only on the enclosed flux, not
   on the path shape — exactly the holonomy structure of Berry phase
4. The AB effect shows that the gauge potential A is physically meaningful (not just
   a mathematical convenience), which connects to the "control data" theme of the
   uncuttable companion

### AB oscillations
In a ring geometry, the eigenstates satisfy periodic boundary conditions with the
modified quantization: E_m ∝ (m - Φ/Φ_0)² where Φ_0 = h/e is the flux quantum.
The spectrum is periodic in Φ with period Φ_0, and conductance oscillations with
this periodicity are observed experimentally.

## Proposed Remark
Remark 5.4 in action-angle paper (after energy-time, before Section 6).
