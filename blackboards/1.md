# KAM Theorem and the Integrability Boundary
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S126

## Context
The action-angle satellite establishes the conjugacy tradeoff for integrable systems:
sharp actions ↔ delocalized angles. What happens when integrability is broken?
Section 7 (Outlook) is just 2 lines; a brief boundary remark is natural.

## Key claims

1. **KAM theorem.** For nearly integrable H = H_0 + εH_1, a set of positive
   measure of invariant tori survives for small ε (Diophantine frequency ratios).
   On these tori, action-angle coordinates remain well-defined.

2. **Destruction of resonant tori.** Tori with rational frequency ratios are
   destroyed, replaced by chaotic layers and island chains (Poincaré-Birkhoff).
   Action variables cease to be globally well-defined in chaotic regions.

3. **Quantum signatures: level statistics.** Integrable → Poisson statistics
   (uncorrelated levels, good quantum numbers). Fully chaotic → Wigner-Dyson
   (level repulsion, no good quantum numbers). BGS conjecture (1984), supported
   by extensive numerical evidence (not proven in general).

4. **Boundary statement.** The action-angle indeterminacy of Sections 3-6
   presupposes integrability. The framework is exact for integrable systems,
   approximate within KAM tori for nearly integrable ones, and inapplicable
   to fully chaotic systems.

5. **Eigenstate thermalization (ETH).** In fully chaotic systems, individual
   eigenstates appear thermal for local observables (matrix elements depend
   smoothly on energy). This is the extreme opposite of the structured
   action-angle tradeoff: the absence of conserved actions leads to
   delocalization over the energy shell.

## Reviewer feedback (mathematical physicist)
All 5 claims CORRECT (caveats: BGS is conjecture not theorem; ETH concerns
matrix elements not literal uniformity; mixed regime has Berry-Robnik statistics).
Recommends: 3-4 lines in Section 7 marking the boundary clearly.

## Proposed remark for action-angle satellite
Remark 7.1 (~3 lines): state that framework assumes integrability, mention KAM
for near-integrability, note that full chaos replaces structured tradeoff with
eigenstate thermalization.
