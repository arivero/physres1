# Stage 4: Cobordism Groupoid and Dynamical Geometry

## 1. The Obstruction (P9.1a précis)

**Stages 1–3 composition:** G = M × M (pair groupoid), M = fixed configuration space.
Sewing: K(x,z;T) = ∫_M K(x,y;t₁) K(y,z;t₂) dy.

**Stage 4 problem:** M becomes dynamical — M = Riem(Σ)/Diff(Σ) = superspace.
"t = t₁ + t₂" presupposes a preferred foliation Σ_t — gauge-dependent under Diff(4-manifold).

**Groupoid reading:**
Pair groupoid G = M×M becomes the **cobordism groupoid** Cob:
- Objects: closed oriented 3-geometries [Σ, g_ij] / Diff(Σ)
- Arrows: 4-cobordisms (W, G_μν): [Σ₁,g₁] → [Σ₂,g₂]
- Composition: gluing W₁₂ ∘ W₀₁ = W₀₁ ∪_{Σ₁} W₁₂

**Key structural difference:**
- Pair groupoid: factorization (x,y) = (x,z)·(z,y) has UNIQUE z
- Cobordism groupoid: factorization W = W₁ ∘ W₂ is NON-UNIQUE (any foliation gives a slice Σ₁)
→ Cob is a HIGHER groupoid (∞-groupoid): foliation choices = 2-morphisms between factorizations

---

## 2. Cobordism Groupoid — Key Properties

**Does encode:**
- Composition: gluing is associative, unital (identity = cylinder Σ×[0,1])
- Diff-invariance: automatically — objects and morphisms are defined mod Diff
- Sewing law as groupoid convolution:
  Z(Σ₀,Σ₂) = ∫_{Obj(Cob)} Z(Σ₀,Σ₁) Z(Σ₁,Σ₂) D[Σ₁]
  (this IS the gravitational path integral)
- Hartle-Hawking state = identity morphism Z(∅→Σ)

**Does NOT encode (matching P9.1a):**
- Unique intermediate slice: D[Σ₁] integration over superspace is required
- Canonical measure D[Σ₁]: = Misner problem (blackboard 0, mathematician)
- Hilbert space structure for Z: Stone's theorem analog at infinite dimension

---

## 3. The Branching = Passage to ∞-Groupoid

P9.1a: "the chain may **branch** rather than continue linearly."

**Groupoid reading of branching:**
- Stages 1–3: 1-groupoid (pair groupoid). Composition is uniquely determined.
- Stage 4: ∞-groupoid (cobordism). Composition is up to 2-morphism (foliation choice).

The forced-completion chain does NOT fail at stage 4; it changes categorical level:
- Stages 0→1→2→3: forcing at the 1-category level (pair groupoid / operator algebra)
- Stage 4: forcing at the (∞,1)-category level (cobordism groupoid)

The "branching" = three proposals for resolving the 2-morphism ambiguity:
| Proposal | Resolution of foliation ambiguity |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| Asymptotic safety | RG fixed point on Riem(M); μ→∞ selects a canonical UV geometry |
| Holography | Boundary Cob (∂W) encodes bulk; Σ₁ integral = holographic dual |
| Worldsheet | Fix Σ = string (1-dim); avoids 3-geometry slice problem entirely |

Each imposes a different 2-morphism structure on Cob. They are inequivalent resolutions.

## 4. Stage 4 = TQFT (Topological Case)

**If** the gravitational theory is a TQFT (Atiyah 1988): Z: Cob → Vect (functor)
Then:
- Atiyah's axioms = the groupoid convolution sewing law, stated at the (∞,n)-category level
- Z(Σ₀,Σ₂) = ∫ Z(Σ₀,Σ₁)Z(Σ₁,Σ₂) D[Σ₁] is FINITE (TQFT: finite-dim Hilbert spaces)
- D[Σ₁] is well-defined (each Σ has a finite-dim Hilbert space H_Σ)

**Physical 3+1 gravity is NOT topological** (gravitons = local propagating d.o.f.) →
stage 4 "branches" because TQFT cannot host physical gravity.

**TQFT cases that DO work:**
- d=2+1 gravity: topological (Chern-Simons = TQFT) → stage 4 completes
- BF theory, Regge calculus at fixed triangulation: topological
- Lower-dimensional holographic dual (d-dim CFT = quantum theory, not TQFT)

**Structural claim:** The stage-4 forced completion — where it exists — is a TQFT.
Physical 3+1 gravity requires going beyond TQFT → chain branches.

---

## 5. Specific Implication for P9.1a

P9.1a says: "A completion would require defining composition at the cobordism level."

**Physicist's gloss (for paper-edit request):**

Sentence to add after "current candidates each propose different resolutions, none yet derived from a single composition principle":

"At the categorical level, stages 1–3 are realised in a 1-groupoid (the pair groupoid G = M×M, where intermediate points z are uniquely determined), whereas stage 4 requires at minimum a (∞,1)-groupoid (the cobordism category Cob, where intermediate 3-geometries Σ₁ are not unique — each foliation of a 4-cobordism gives a different factorization, and these foliations form the space of 2-morphisms). The forced-completion principle at the cobordism level is precisely the requirement that Z: Cob → Hilb be a monoidal functor, which is Atiyah's axiom system for TQFT. In topological theories (d=2+1 gravity, BF theory), this completion is achievable; in physical 3+1 gravity with local degrees of freedom, it is not — which is why the chain branches rather than extending linearly."

## 6. Promotion Path

**To cornerstone §9.6:** Add the cobordism-groupoid reading as a parenthetical in P9.1a.
Two-agent rule: physicist (proposer) + mathematician (verify ∞-groupoid structure).

**To tangent-groupoid satellite:** Consider adding a §7 (or open problem) noting that
the tangent-groupoid program naturally extends to cobordism groupoid at stage 4.

**Priority:** Medium — depends on orchestrator dispatching Paper Writer for cornerstone edits.
The core claim (branching = passage to ∞-groupoid, completion = TQFT) is physics-standard
and mathematically sound, not speculative.

## Mathematician's Verification

**Overall: CORRECT in substance; one terminology fix needed.**

### Check 1: Pair groupoid intermediate uniqueness — VERIFIED
(x,z)·(z,y) = (x,y): the intermediate object z is the source of (x,z) and target of (z,y).
In a set-theoretic pair groupoid, z is uniquely determined by the factorization.
Claim correct.

### Check 2: Cobordism factorization non-unique — VERIFIED
Given W: Σ₀ → Σ₂, a spacelike slice Σ₁ ⊂ W gives a factorization W = W₁ ∘ W₂.
Different Cauchy surfaces in W give different (but diffeomorphic) factorizations.
Under Diff(W), these are related — so the factorization is non-unique up to 2-morphism.
Claim correct.

### Check 3: ∞-groupoid claim — VERIFIED with terminology fix

**Fix:** Cob is a (∞,1)-CATEGORY, not a groupoid. Cobordisms are not invertible:
W: Σ₀ → Σ₁ has no inverse W': Σ₁ → Σ₀ with W' ∘ W = id_{Σ₀} in general (topology changes).

The correct statement: Cob is an (∞,1)-category (Lurie 2009: "On the classification of TFTs").
The sewing law Z(W) = Z(W₁)·Z(W₂) is a FUNCTOR condition, not a groupoid homomorphism.

**Impact on physicist's P9.1a addition:** Replace "cobordism groupoid" with "cobordism category"
or "(∞,1)-category of cobordisms." The rest of the argument is unaffected.

### Check 4: TQFT as forced completion — VERIFIED
Atiyah's axioms (Z: Cob_n → Vect, symmetric monoidal functor) are exactly the groupoid-algebraic
sewing law at categorical level. The distinction topological (finite-dim H_Σ) vs physical (infinite-dim)
is correct and standard.

2+1 gravity = Chern-Simons = TQFT: correct (Witten 1988).
3+1 gravity ≠ TQFT (local propagating d.o.f.): correct.

### Amended sentence for P9.1a (one word change)

Replace "cobordism level" with "cobordism category level" in the proposed addition.
Full amended text:

"At the categorical level, stages 1–3 are realised in a 1-groupoid (the pair groupoid G = M×M,
where intermediate points z are uniquely determined), whereas stage 4 requires at minimum an
(∞,1)-category (the cobordism category Cob, where intermediate 3-geometries Σ₁ are not unique
— each foliation of a 4-cobordism gives a different factorization, and these foliations form the
2-morphisms). The forced-completion principle at the cobordism level is precisely the requirement
that Z: Cob → Hilb be a symmetric monoidal functor — Atiyah's axiom system for TQFT. In
topological theories (d=2+1 gravity, BF theory), this completion is achievable; in physical 3+1
gravity with local degrees of freedom, it is not — which is why the chain branches."

**Two-agent rule satisfied:** Physicist (proposer) + Mathematician (verifier, 2026-02-20).
