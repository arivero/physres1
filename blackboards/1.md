# Mandelstam-Tamm Energy-Time Uncertainty: The Temporal Analog
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S146

## Context
Target: action-angle paper, Section 5 (after Remark 5.2 on decoherence, before Section 6). The paper quantifies the action-angle tradeoff for (Lz, φ) and (n, θ). The Mandelstam-Tamm relation is the temporal version: energy (action) vs time (angle), stated in a completely referee-safe way that avoids the "time operator" problem.

## Key Claims

### The problem with "energy-time uncertainty"
The naive ΔE · Δt ≥ ℏ/2 is often cited but poorly defined because time is not an observable (no self-adjoint time operator in standard QM for systems with bounded-below Hamiltonian — Pauli's theorem).

### The Mandelstam-Tamm resolution (1945)
Define "time uncertainty" operationally through any observable A:

  Δt_A := ΔA / |d⟨A⟩/dt|

This is the time for the expectation value of A to change by one standard deviation — a measure of "how long before A has observably evolved." Then from the Robertson inequality for (H, A):

  ΔE · ΔA ≥ (ℏ/2)|⟨[H,A]⟩/iℏ| = (ℏ/2)|d⟨A⟩/dt|

Dividing both sides by |d⟨A⟩/dt|:

  ΔE · Δt_A ≥ ℏ/2

This is exact, well-defined, and requires no time operator.

### Connection to action-angle
The structural parallel is precise:
- In Sections 3-4: ΔLz · (angular spread) ≥ ℏ/2 (sharp action → delocalized angle)
- In M-T: ΔE · Δt_A ≥ ℏ/2 (sharp energy → slow evolution of all observables)

An energy eigenstate (ΔE = 0) has d⟨A⟩/dt = 0 for every observable A — nothing changes, the state is completely static. This is the temporal analog of "an Lz eigenstate has uniform φ" (Section 3): sharp action → complete delocalization in the conjugate variable.

Conversely, a state with rapid evolution (small Δt_A) must have large ΔE — a broad energy superposition. This is the temporal analog of "localizing φ requires many m-modes" (Section 4).

### For the harmonic oscillator
The coherent state |α⟩ has ΔE = ℏω|α| and evolves with period T = 2π/ω. The M-T time for the position observable is Δt_x = 1/ω (independent of |α|), and ΔE · Δt_x = ℏ|α| ≥ ℏ/2 (since |α| ≥ 1/2 for localized states). This matches the action-angle story of Example 6.1.

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 5.3 in Section 5, after Remark 5.2 (decoherence), before Section 6.

Content: The Mandelstam-Tamm relation ΔE · Δt_A ≥ ℏ/2 as the temporal version of the action-angle tradeoff. Energy eigenstates (ΔE = 0) have d⟨A⟩/dt = 0 for all observables — the temporal analog of azimuthal uniformity in Section 3. Rapid evolution requires broad energy spread — the temporal analog of angular localization requiring many m-modes.
