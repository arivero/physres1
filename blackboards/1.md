# Huang-Yang Pseudopotential: Regularization Built into the Operator
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S140

## Context
Target: fermionic mediators paper, Section 4. Currently has Derivation 4.1 and Remark 4.2. The pseudopotential method provides a concrete realization of the "contact kernel with built-in regularization" idea.

## Key Claims

### The problem with naive delta in 3D
In d=3, the Hamiltonian H = -ℏ²∇²/(2m) + g₀ δ³(r) is not well-defined as a self-adjoint operator when naively applied. The reason: the 3D Green's function G(r) ~ 1/r is singular at the origin, so the Born series for a delta source diverges. This is the UV problem that Examples 5.1-5.2 address via cutoff regularization and renormalization.

### The Huang-Yang pseudopotential (1957)
Huang and Yang proposed a distributional regularization that avoids explicit cutoff manipulation. The pseudopotential is:
  V_pseudo(r) = (2πℏ²a/m) δ³(r) (∂/∂r)(r·)

where the operator (∂/∂r)(r·) acts on the wavefunction as:
  V_pseudo ψ(r) = (2πℏ²a/m) δ³(r) [∂(rψ)/∂r]_{r=0}

This extracts the regular part of the wavefunction at the origin (removing the 1/r singularity of the s-wave Green's function) and automatically implements the scattering-length boundary condition.

### Why this works
For a wavefunction with the asymptotic form ψ(r) ~ A(1/r - 1/a) + (regular), the pseudopotential:
1. Multiplies by r → r·ψ ~ A(1 - r/a) + (higher order)
2. Differentiates → ∂(rψ)/∂r|_{r=0} = -A/a + (regular)
3. Multiplies by δ³(r) → selects the value at r=0

This gives exactly the right source term to produce the scattering-length boundary condition f₀(k) = -a/(1+ika) of Example 5.2.

### Connection to the paper's themes
1. **Contact kernel with built-in regularization**: The pseudopotential is a δ³(r) with a differential operator that regularizes it. The regularization is not an external cutoff but part of the operator definition — exactly the "uncuttable" theme of the companion note.
2. **Self-adjoint extension in disguise**: The (∂/∂r)(r·) operation implements the self-adjoint extension boundary condition at r=0. Different values of a select different extensions.
3. **No explicit RG flow**: Unlike the cutoff approach in Examples 5.1-5.2, the pseudopotential directly defines the renormalized interaction — the scattering length a appears as the parameter, not a bare coupling.

### Usage in many-body physics
The pseudopotential is the standard starting point for dilute Bose gas theory (Gross-Pitaevskii) and Fermi gas theory (BCS-BEC crossover). In mean-field approximation, V_pseudo reduces to the contact interaction gδ³(r) with g = 4πℏ²a/m (the factor 4π vs 2π comes from symmetry/convention).

## Proposed Remark
Target: Remark 4.3, after Remark 4.2 (effective range expansion), before Section 5.

Content: The Huang-Yang pseudopotential V(r) = (2πℏ²a/m) δ³(r)(∂/∂r)(r·) builds the renormalization condition directly into the operator definition, bypassing explicit cutoff manipulation. The differential operator (∂/∂r)(r·) extracts the regular part of the wavefunction at the origin, automatically implementing the scattering-length boundary condition of Example 5.2. This is a "smart" contact kernel — the definition of the interaction includes the prescription for handling the singularity, rather than treating regularization as an external step.
