# Blackboard 1 — Gabor limit / time-frequency duality (Section 4, action-angle)

## Target
Remark 4.6 in action-angle paper, after Remark 4.5 (entropic uncertainty),
before Section 5.

## Core content

The circular Fourier tradeoff of Section 4 has a direct counterpart in
signal processing: the Gabor limit. A signal cannot be simultaneously
localized in time and frequency — the same uncertainty as action-angle.

Key physics:
- Gabor (1946): defined "logons" — elementary signal units of minimum
  time-bandwidth product Δt·Δf ≥ 1/(4π)
- The optimal "logon" is a Gaussian-windowed sinusoid: exp(-t²/2σ²)·e^{2πif₀t}
  — literally a coherent state of the harmonic oscillator (Example 6.1)
  when we identify t↔q and f↔p/h
- The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) tiles phase space (time-frequency
  plane) with cells of area ≥ 1/(4π), exactly the Planck cell ℏ/2 in
  natural units
- Gabor frames: the overcomplete set of time-frequency shifted Gaussians
  {g_{n,k}(t) = g(t - na) · e^{2πikbt}} provides a resolution of identity
  when ab ≤ 1 — this is the coherent-state decomposition of Example 6.1
  applied to signals

Connection to the paper:
- The Fourier tradeoff of Section 4 IS the Gabor limit on the circle
  (replacing ℓ² by ℤ and the line by S¹)
- The von Mises state (Remark 4.4) is the circular analog of the
  Gaussian window function
- The entropic uncertainty of Remark 4.5 maps to Hirschman's inequality
  in signal processing
- The circular concentration R of Proposition 4.2 maps to the spectral
  concentration in Slepian-Landau-Pollak theory (prolate spheroidal
  wave functions)

Practical significance:
- Radar: range-Doppler resolution cells are Gabor cells
- Audio: spectrograms are STFTs; the time-frequency tradeoff determines
  whether one hears pitch or timing
- Quantum optics: homodyne detection measures quadratures, with the
  local oscillator phase playing the role of the Gabor window
