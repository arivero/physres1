# Blackboard 1 — Feynman-Kac formula (Section 3, uncuttable)

## Target
Remark 3.9 in uncuttable paper, after Remark 3.8 (Stone-von Neumann),
before the closing paragraph and Section 4.

## Core content

The Feynman-Kac formula (Kac, 1949) makes the path integral rigorous by
Wick-rotating to imaginary time: the oscillatory e^{iS/ℏ} becomes
the Wiener measure weight e^{-S_E/ℏ}, which is a genuine probability
measure on continuous paths.

Formula: For V ≥ 0 bounded below and continuous,
  ⟨x| e^{-tH} |y⟩ = E^{W}_{x→y}[exp(-∫₀ᵗ V(B_s) ds)]
where B_s is a Brownian bridge from x to y in time t, and E^W is the
Wiener measure expectation.

Key points for the paper's "uncuttable" theme:
1. **Rigorous refinement limit**: The Wiener measure is the genuine
   σ-additive measure on C([0,t]) that the time-sliced approximants
   converge to. Unlike the Minkowski path integral (which has no
   σ-additive measure — see Cameron 1960), the Euclidean version
   is mathematically well-defined.

2. **Connection to Remark 3.2 (Itô/Stratonovich)**: The Wiener measure
   is the natural measure for Itô calculus. The Feynman-Kac formula is
   an Itô-calculus statement: it expresses the quantum propagator
   (in imaginary time) as a Wiener integral.

3. **Connection to Remark 3.3 (Trotter)**: The Feynman-Kac formula can
   be derived FROM the Trotter product formula by inserting complete
   sets of states between each T and V factor, then recognizing the
   free propagators as Gaussian (Wiener) transition densities.

4. **Bridge to constructive QFT (Remark 4.11)**: The Glimm-Jaffe
   construction of φ⁴₂ uses Euclidean methods (the OS axioms) that
   are the field-theory generalization of the Feynman-Kac approach.
   Nelson's Euclidean program (1973) showed that the Euclidean path
   measure → Wightman QFT reconstruction goes through the
   Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity axiom — the analog
   of the positivity of the Wiener measure.

5. **The "uncuttable" message**: The Minkowski path integral has no
   measure — it is formal. The Euclidean version has a genuine
   measure but requires Wick rotation (analytic continuation in time)
   as "control data." Neither the Minkowski formal expression nor
   any finite time-slicing is the answer; the answer requires the
   full measure-theoretic or analytic-continuation machinery.

6. **Cameron's theorem (1960)**: There is no countably additive
   measure on path space that makes ∫e^{iS/ℏ} Dq a Lebesgue
   integral. This is WHY the Euclidean rotation is necessary for
   rigour — the refinement limit literally does not exist as a
   measure in Minkowski signature.
