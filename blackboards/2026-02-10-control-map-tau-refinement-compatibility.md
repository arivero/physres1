# Control Map \(\tau\): A Refinement-Compatibility Formulation (Derivation-First)

Date: 2026-02-10

Goal of this note: state *precisely* what it means to “compare refinements” when amplitudes/kernels are defined via discretization/regularization, and to isolate a clean role for a control/flow map \(\tau\) (RG-style compatibility).

This is written in our own language; preprints are treated as idea guides, not as evidence.

## 1) Objects and scales
We distinguish:
- **Resolution** (discretization scale): \(h>0\) (e.g. time step \(h=T/N\) or lattice spacing).
- **Action-scale regulator**: \(\eta\) (dimension of action; later one may identify \(\eta=\hbar\) if the physical identification is justified).
- **Couplings**: \(g\) (collective symbol for parameters in the action).
- **Scalarization gauge** (if used): \(L_\ast\) or \(\sigma_\ast\) (choice of reference density/half-density), which is a convention parameter rather than a dynamical coupling.

At a given resolution \(h\), a discretized/regularized amplitude is a map
\[
A_{h,\theta}:\ \mathcal O \to \mathbb C,
\]
where \(\mathcal O\) is a class of observables (test functions/functionals) and \(\theta\) is the parameter bundle, e.g.
\[
\theta=(\eta,g;L_\ast).
\]

## 2) Refinement and coarse-graining maps
Let \(b>1\) be a refinement factor (e.g. \(b=2\)).
- **Refinement** sends a coarse description at scale \(h\) to a finer one at scale \(h/b\).
- **Coarse-graining** (the direction relevant for RG) goes from fine to coarse by integrating out intermediate variables.

Abstractly, coarse-graining is an operator
\[
\mathcal C_b:\ A_{h/b,\theta}\ \mapsto\ \mathcal C_b(A_{h/b,\theta}),
\]
whose output is an effective amplitude at scale \(h\), typically still depending on \(\theta\) but not necessarily in the same functional form.

## 3) Compatibility condition and the control map \(\tau_b\)
The *refinement-compatibility* requirement is that coarse-graining lands back inside the same family of amplitudes, possibly after a parameter redefinition:

\[
\boxed{\ \mathcal C_b\!\big(A_{h/b,\theta}\big)\;=\;A_{h,\tau_b(\theta)}\ }\tag{\(*\)}
\]

where
- \(\tau_b\) is a **control map** (parameter flow) induced by coarse-graining,
- and the equality is understood as equality of linear functionals on \(\mathcal O\) (i.e. equality of all amplitudes for all observables in the chosen class).

This is the structural content we want:
- if \(\tau_b\) exists for all \(b\) in a semigroup (and composes consistently), then the family \(\{A_{h,\theta}\}\) is stable under refinement;
- if no such \(\tau_b\) exists, the refinement limit is ill-posed unless one enlarges the parameter family (new counterterms/operators).

### Semigroup property (consistency across multiple steps)
Applying coarse-graining with factors \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) in succession should match the single step \(b_1b_2\). The induced \(\tau\) must satisfy
\[
\tau_{b_1b_2} \;\approx\; \tau_{b_1}\circ\tau_{b_2},
\]
up to any explicit rescalings/conventions built into \(\mathcal C_b\). This is where “RG as semigroup” naturally enters.

## 4) What counts as invariant vs scheme-dependent?
Equation (\(*\)) is not unique because:
- \(\mathcal C_b\) depends on how we choose to coarse-grain (blocking scheme, normalization choices),
- \(\theta\) includes convention parameters (e.g. scalarization gauge) unless fixed.

The invariant content typically lives in:
- existence/nonexistence of a compatible flow \(\tau_b\) for a chosen class of observables,
- fixed points and their relevant/irrelevant directions (once the parameter family is specified),
- RG-invariant scales generated by the flow (dimensional transmutation).

## 5) Toy model where compatibility is exact: Gaussian kernel semigroup
Consider the free kernel on \(\mathbb R^d\) in the simplest form
\[
K_t(x,y)=\frac{1}{(4\pi i \eta t/m)^{d/2}}\exp\!\left(\frac{i m|x-y|^2}{4\eta t}\right).
\]
The semigroup/composition property is exact:
\[
\int_{\mathbb R^d} K_{t_1}(x,z)\,K_{t_2}(z,y)\,dz \;=\; K_{t_1+t_2}(x,y).
\]
In this case the coarse-graining operator “integrate out the midpoint” closes on the same family with **trivial** parameter flow:
\[
\tau_b(\eta)=\eta,\qquad \tau_b(m)=m,
\]
and only the resolution parameter changes (time steps add).

Interpretation: this is the ideal case where refinement compatibility is automatic; no counterterms are needed.

## 6) Heuristic lesson for interacting cases
If interaction terms deform the exponent away from a Gaussian (or introduce singularities), then midpoint integration typically generates:
- new local operators (counterterms) and/or
- redefinitions of existing couplings,
so that closing (\(*\)) requires enlarging \(\theta\) and letting \(\tau_b\) act nontrivially.

From the repo’s standpoint, this is the conceptual route by which:
- “stationary extremes” (classical support of limiting measures) and
- “refinement-compatible composition”
force **renormalization** as the condition for existence of a continuum limit.

## 7) Next promotion target
Promote a short version of (\(*\)) into `paper/main.md` near the “Refinement Compatibility Principle” and the RG discussion, as the precise meaning of “compare discretizations at fixed ruler”.
