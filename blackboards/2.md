# Wigner Function and Sub-Planck Structure
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S133

## Context
The action-angle paper shows three phase-space portraits via Husimi:
- Fock ring (sharp action, delocalized angle) — Remark 6.4
- Coherent blob (balanced) — Example 6.1
- Squeezed ellipse (asymmetric) — Remark 6.5

A remark about the Wigner function would complete the phase-space picture by
showing what the Husimi smoothing hides: interference fringes, negativity, and
sub-Planck structure.

## Key claims

1. **Wigner function definition.** W(x,p) = (1/πℏ) ∫ ψ*(x+y) ψ(x-y) e^{2ipy/ℏ} dy.
   Unlike Husimi, W can take negative values — negativity is a signature of
   non-classical correlations. W is the unique quasiprobability satisfying
   correct marginals: ∫W dp = |ψ(x)|² and ∫W dx = |ψ̃(p)|².

2. **Wigner function of Fock states.** For |n⟩, the Wigner function involves
   Laguerre polynomials: W_n(x,p) = ((-1)^n/πℏ) L_n(2H/ℏω) exp(-2H/ℏω),
   where H = (p²+ω²x²)/(2). This is negative in alternating rings — unlike
   the Husimi ring which is everywhere non-negative. The negativity reveals
   structure below the Planck scale (ℏ) that Husimi averaging erases.

3. **Husimi as Gaussian-smoothed Wigner.** Q(α) = (2/π) ∫∫ W(x,p)
   exp(-2((x-x₀)²+...)/ℏ) dx dp. The Husimi function is the Wigner function
   convolved with a Gaussian of width √ℏ. This smoothing eliminates all
   negative regions but also erases fine-grained interference information.
   Remark 6.4's non-negativity of Q is a direct consequence of this smoothing.

4. **Structural lesson for action-angle.** The Husimi function (Remark 6.4) is
   the "coarse-grained" phase-space portrait, appropriate for visualizing the
   action-angle tradeoff. The Wigner function is the "fine-grained" portrait,
   revealing quantum coherences that the tradeoff language doesn't capture.
   For Fock states, both show circular symmetry (uniform angle), but the Wigner
   function's alternating-sign rings reveal that "sharp action" has sub-Planck
   consequences invisible in Husimi.

## Proposed remark for action-angle satellite
Remark 6.6 (~3 lines) after Remark 6.5 (squeezed states). Briefly note that
Husimi = Gaussian-smoothed Wigner, and that Wigner's negativity reveals
sub-Planck structure that the non-negative Husimi portrait hides. Connect to
Remark 6.4's "non-negative probability picture" statement. Keep compact.

### Claim-by-claim analysis

**1. Wigner function definition (line 17): CORRECT**
The definition W(x,p) = (1/πℏ) ∫ ψ*(x+y) ψ(x-y) e^{2ipy/ℏ} dy is the standard
form. Prefactor, symmetric displacement, and exponential phase are all correct.
The marginal properties are correctly stated.

**2. Wigner function of Fock states (line 23): ERROR**
The Laguerre polynomial argument is wrong. The correct formula is:
  W_n(x,p) = ((-1)^n/πℏ) L_n(2H/ℏω) exp(-2H/ℏω)
NOT L_n(4H/ℏω). The factor should be 2, not 4. This is a standard result from
Cohen-Tannoudji et al., Complement G_III, and many quantum optics texts.
The claim about negativity in alternating rings is correct.

**3. Husimi = Gaussian-smoothed Wigner (line 28): CORRECT WITH CAVEATS**
The conceptual claim is absolutely correct: Q(α) is indeed the Wigner function
convolved with a Gaussian kernel. The width √ℏ is correct in natural units for
the harmonic oscillator, but the exact expression depends on conventions. For
the physical interpretation (smoothing eliminates negativity), this is spot-on.

**4. Sub-Planck structure language (line 26): CORRECT WITH CAVEATS**
"Sub-Planck" is standard jargon in quantum optics (see Schleich, "Quantum Optics
in Phase Space", §5.4). However, it's potentially confusing: it means structure
finer than the minimal uncertainty cell ΔxΔp ~ ℏ, NOT structure at the Planck
length 10^-35 m. Consider adding a clarifying phrase like "sub-Planck (i.e.,
finer than the minimal uncertainty cell)" on first use.

**5. Structural lesson (line 34): CORRECT**
The coarse-grained vs fine-grained characterization is accurate and pedagogically
useful. The connection to Remark 6.4's action-angle tradeoff is appropriate. The
observation that circular symmetry is preserved but detailed structure differs
is exactly right.

### Overall assessment
The blackboard is solid conceptually but contains one quantitative error (the
Laguerre polynomial argument). Fix line 23 to use 2H/ℏω instead of 4H/ℏω.
Consider adding a brief clarification of "sub-Planck" to avoid confusion with
Planck-scale (quantum gravity) physics. The proposed Remark 6.6 is well-motivated
and would complement the existing Husimi discussion nicely.
