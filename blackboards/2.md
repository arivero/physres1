# OQ2 Axiomatization Landscape: Reconstructions vs. Categorical Foundations

## Overview

OQ2 asks: what is the minimal axiom set for RCP? Current project status: **composition (C) + physical setup = master axioms for P4.2**.

This blackboard surveys recent (2023-2025) axiomatization frameworks to identify cleaner or more unified approaches to capturing this "composition + setup" result.

## 1. Modern Reconstruction Program (Hardy-Chiribella Framework)

### Hardy's Five Axioms (2001)
Hardy (arXiv:quant-ph/0101012) derives quantum theory from five "reasonable axioms":
1. **Simplicity:** 2-dimensional Hilbert space suffices for elementary system
2. **Continuous Reversibility:** Pure-state evolution is continuous + reversible
3. **Composability:** Subsystems combine via tensor product
4. **Local Discriminability:** States distinguishable by local measurement
5. **Continuity:** No gaps in state preparation/transformation space

**Critical axiom:** Axiom 5 (continuity) — drop it → classical probability theory.

### Later Refinements (Chiribella/Dakic/Masanes 2011+)
- Hardy's "Simplicity" axiom is ad hoc; removable
- **Minimal core:** Information capacity + composition rules + reversibility
- Three principles sufficient: (a) limited info capacity, (b) tensor product composition, (c) reversible evolution
- Status: 2024-2025 active research at Perimeter (Hardy time-symmetric formulation)

### Comparison to P4.2
| Property | P4.2 Composition | Hardy Framework |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Master axioms | 1 (composition) + setup | 3-5 operational principles |
| Composition rule | Exponential weights (path integral) | Tensor product (subsystems) |
| Continuity role | Implicit in limit operators | Explicit in Axiom 5 |
| Simplicity assumption | Minimal: action + mass | Information capacity + continuity |

## 2. Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT)

### Haag-Kastler Axioms (Foundational)
AQFT formalizes QFT via local nets of observable algebras:
1. **Locality:** Spacelike-separated regions commute
2. **Isotony:** Larger regions ⊃ smaller regions (inclusion)
3. **Additivity:** Nets refine as spacetime patches shrink; limit well-defined

**Composition mechanism:** Local nets compose via subnets—refinement BUILT IN at axiomatic level.

**2024-2025 status:** Active research in topological chiral homology, factorization algebras, blob homology for higher-dimensional extensions.

### Connection to RCP's Three Channels
- **AQFT Locality** ↔ **RCP Partition Channel** (subdivide spacetime)
- **AQFT Isotony** ↔ **RCP Representation Channel** (observables consistent across scales)
- **AQFT Additivity** ↔ **RCP Scale Channel** (limits of local nets well-defined)

**Novel insight:** Haag-Kastler's three axioms directly implement RCP's three channels, suggesting AQFT IS already an RCP framework at the operator-algebra level.

## 3. Categorical Quantum Mechanics (Abramsky-Coecke)

### Core Formalism (2004+)
Quantum mechanics encoded in a **dagger symmetric monoidal category**:
- **Morphisms** = quantum processes
- **Tensor product** = parallel composition
- **Dagger** = adjoint (time reversal, reversibility)
- **String diagrams** = compositional notation

### Key Result
"From seemingly weak abstract constraints on compositional structure, many quantum phenomena are derivable."

**Examples:** Teleportation, entanglement swapping, logic-gate protocols all emerge as categorical identities without explicit Hilbert space assumption.

### Minimality Claim
Categorical QM derives quantum phenomena from:
- Compositional structure (monoidal tensor)
- Dagger (reversibility)
- Closure under composition

**No axioms needed on:** dimension, measure, state space, Born rule → all emerge categorically.

### Connection to P4.2
- **Categorical composition** = **P4.2 multiplicative amplitude law**
- **Dagger structure** = **RCP representation-channel symmetry** (time-reversibility)
- **Monoidal closure** = **RCP partition refinement algebraically**

## 4. Refined Hierarchy: All Four Frameworks

| Framework | Axioms | Composition | Refinement Encodes | Outcome |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Hardy** | 5 operational | Tensor product | State-space continuity | Hilbert space QM |
| **AQFT** | 3 locality | Local nets + subnets | Spacelike partition + limits | Operator algebras |
| **Categorical** | Monoidal structure | Morphism composition | String diagram reduction | Abstract protocols |
| **P4.2 (RCP)** | 1 composition + setup | Exponential amplitude weights | Partition/repr/scale limits | Path integral quantization |

## 5. Hypothesis: OQ2-H1 (Axiomatization Convergence)

**Claim:** All four frameworks encode the same minimalist principle: composition + structural compatibility across refinement levels.

**Specific mappings:**
- Hardy's Axiom 5 (continuity) ↔ RCP limit compatibility
- AQFT's Locality ↔ RCP partition channel
- Categorical Dagger ↔ RCP representation-channel symmetry
- All four → P4.2's composition-forces-exponential at path integral level

**Test:** Reorganize Hardy's five axioms as (partition / representation / scale) conditions. If successful isomorphism, Hardy framework = operationalized RCP.

## 6. Open Questions for Mathematician/Physicist

1. **Hierarchy test:** Can Hardy's axioms be reorganized as RCP's (partition/repr/scale)? → If yes, Hardy = operationalized RCP.

2. **AQFT-RCP equivalence:** Are Haag-Kastler + additivity formally equivalent to RCP's three channels applied to observable algebras?

3. **Categorical embedding:** Does categorical QM's monoidal structure contain a sub-category isomorphic to RCP-restricted phenomena?

4. **Minimal count:** Can P4.2's "1 axiom + setup" be formally derived from any of (Hardy/AQFT/Categorical) alone?

5. **Continuity role:** Is Hardy's Axiom 5 the same continuity as appears in RCP limit operators and Stone's theorem?

## 7. Implications for Cornerstone

If OQ2-H1 confirmed:
- **Conceptual gain:** RCP is not idiosyncratic—deepest common substrate of modern QM axiomatizations
- **Formalization:** Rewrite cornerstone's RCP section using AQFT language (local nets respecting RCP), more rigorous
- **Cross-validation:** Hardy reconstruction becomes independent proof that RCP-like principles force QM
- **Pedagogical:** Explain QM to different audiences (operational, algebraic, categorical) while maintaining RCP spine

## 8. Status

**Student:** OQ2 landscape survey, hypothesis OQ2-H1 formulated. Collected 3 papers (Grinbaum, Hardy abstract, AQFT nLab, arXiv:2512.18002 systematization).

**Next:** Mathematician to verify OQ2-H1 (axiom-set isomorphism test). Pick Hardy → RCP mapping and verify formalization.

**Optional:** Physicist compute Hardy axiom application (Bell inequalities) and verify consistency with P4.2.

**Severity:** sev-3 exploratory (not load-bearing for cornerstone, but conceptually important for foundations clarity).
