# Stochastic Discretization: Itô vs Stratonovich from N-Impulse Time-Slicing
Date: 2026-02-14
Cycle: S282 (parent: D25)

## Setup: Position-Dependent Random Impulses

Consider the N-impulse model of Dirac-probes Section 4.5, but now with
**position-dependent** impulse magnitudes. At each junction time t_k = k Dt,
the particle receives a random impulse J_k whose variance depends on the
current position:

  J_k = sigma(q_k^*) sqrt(Dt) xi_k

where xi_k are i.i.d. standard normals, sigma(q) is the noise amplitude
(position-dependent), and q_k^* is the position at which sigma is evaluated.

The choice of q_k^* is the discretization convention:
- **Prepoint** (Itô): q_k^* = q_k
- **Midpoint** (Stratonovich): q_k^* = (q_k + q_{k+1})/2

## The SDE Correspondence

The discrete update equation for velocity (free particle + random impulse):

  v_{k+1} = v_k + sigma(q_k^*) sqrt(Dt) xi_k / m

and for position:

  q_{k+1} = q_k + v_k Dt + (1/m) sigma(q_k^*) sqrt(Dt) xi_k Dt

In the simplest form (overdamped limit, or directly modeling position updates
with multiplicative noise), consider:

  q_{k+1} - q_k = f(q_k^*) Dt + g(q_k^*) DW_k

where DW_k = sqrt(Dt) xi_k is a Wiener increment.

## The Itô Correction: Explicit Computation

### Model: g(q) = q (geometric Brownian motion), f(q) = 0

**Midpoint (Stratonovich) discretization:**

  q_{k+1} - q_k = (q_k + q_{k+1})/2 * DW_k

Solve for q_{k+1}:

  q_{k+1} (1 - DW_k/2) = q_k (1 + DW_k/2)
  q_{k+1} = q_k (1 + DW_k/2) / (1 - DW_k/2)

To O(Dt):

  q_{k+1} = q_k (1 + DW_k/2)(1 + DW_k/2 + (DW_k)^2/4 + ...)
           = q_k (1 + DW_k + (DW_k)^2/2 + ...)

Taking E[DW_k^2] = Dt, the expected increment is:

  E[q_{k+1} - q_k] = q_k * Dt/2 + O(Dt^{3/2})

So the Stratonovich equation dq = q o dW (zero drift) has an **effective mean drift** of (1/2) q Dt per step.

**Prepoint (Itô) discretization:**

  q_{k+1} - q_k = q_k DW_k

  E[q_{k+1} - q_k] = q_k E[DW_k] = 0

The Itô equation dq = q dW has zero mean drift.

### The correction term

The Stratonovich-to-Itô conversion formula (general 1D):

  g(q) o dW = g(q) dW + (1/2) g(q) g'(q) dt

For g(q) = q: g'(q) = 1, so the correction is:

  **(1/2) g(q) g'(q) dt = (1/2) q dt**

**Verification:** The Stratonovich SDE  dq = q o dW  is equivalent to
the Itô SDE  dq = (1/2) q dt + q dW. This is consistent with the explicit
discrete calculation above: the midpoint convention generates a spurious
drift (1/2)q that is absent in the prepoint convention.

## Mapping to the Time-Slicing Language

### Connection to Dirac-probes Remark 3.2a

The impulse-work formula DH = J * v_bar uses the **midpoint velocity**
v_bar = (v_+ + v_-)/2 (Stratonovich). Using the prepoint velocity v_-
instead (Itô) gives DH = J * v_-.

The difference is:

  DH_Strat - DH_Ito = J * (v_bar - v_-) = J * (v_+ - v_-)/2 = J^2 / (2m)

For random impulses with E[J^2] = sigma^2 Dt, this gives a systematic
energy drift of sigma^2/(2m) per time step -- the Itô correction to the
energy. Accumulated over N steps of size Dt = T/N:

  DH_total = N * sigma^2 Dt / (2m) = sigma^2 T / (2m)

This is the "noise-induced drift" familiar from stochastic thermodynamics.

### Connection to main paper Section 6.3

The alpha-discretization of Section 6.3 evaluates position at
q_alpha = (1 - alpha) q_k + alpha q_{k+1}:

  alpha = 0: prepoint (Itô)
  alpha = 1/2: midpoint (Stratonovich)
  alpha = 1: postpoint (anti-Itô)

For the H = qp ordering witness (Derivation D4.1b), the quantum operator is:

  H_alpha = p q + alpha i hbar

The alpha-dependent O(hbar) shift has the **same structural origin** as the
Itô correction: both arise from the O(Dt) or O(hbar) cost of moving the
evaluation point from prepoint to midpoint. Specifically:

  - In stochastic calculus: Strat-to-Itô adds (1/2) g g' dt
  - In path integral: alpha-to-0 shifts the quantum Hamiltonian by alpha i hbar
  - Both are "chain-rule correction" terms generated by commuting a
    nonlinear function with an increment that has O(sqrt(Dt)) fluctuations.

The Stratonovich convention preserves the chain rule (classical calculus);
the Weyl/midpoint ordering preserves the symplectic/variational structure.
The Itô convention breaks the chain rule but has better martingale properties;
the prepoint ordering breaks manifest symmetry but simplifies certain path
integral computations.

## Hypotheses (scope boundary)

- The model is 1D, one degree of freedom.
- The noise is multiplicative but smooth in q (sigma in C^1).
- The discrete-to-continuum limit exists (standard Euler-Maruyama convergence).
- The correspondence holds in the same sense as Derivation D4.1b:
  different discretizations share the same classical limit but differ
  at O(hbar) or O(Dt) subleading order.
- This is **not** a claim that path integrals "are" stochastic processes.
  The dictionary maps discretization conventions, not ontologies.
