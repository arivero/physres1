## 3. Critical Path Analysis

**Single point of failure: RCPFoundations.**

If RCPFoundations is rejected:
- OrdEq, TanGrp, RootTree, RGFund, PathIntNorm all reference it as framework paper
- But: each satellite is self-contained in its mathematical content
- Loss = framing ("RCP representation/partition/scale channel"), not substance
- Mitigation: each paper can cite the cornerstone (Main) directly instead

**Robust cluster: Standalones.**

PlanckArea, ActionAngle, RelOrbits, DeltaObj, DiracProbes have NO companion dependencies. These 5 papers survive regardless of what happens to the rest.

**Vulnerable cluster: TangentGroupoid.**

TanGrp depends on 3 other papers (RCPFound, HalfDens, PathIntNorm). If any of these is rejected, TanGrp needs revision to remove or replace the reference. However, TG-P1.1 (the main result) is mathematically self-contained.

## 4. "What If" Scenarios

**Scenario A: Cornerstone (Main) is delayed indefinitely.**
- Impact: RCPFound loses its primary reference. All satellites citing RCPFound lose chain.
- Mitigation: Publish RCPFound as standalone axiomatic paper (already self-contained).
- Residual risk: P4.2 proof lives in Main only. RCPFound currently states P4.2 but defers proof.

**Scenario B: P4.2 (hbar forced) is found to have a gap.**
- Impact: CATASTROPHIC. P4.2 is the cornerstone result. RCPFound, HalfDens, TanGrp, PathIntNorm all reference it.
- But: PlanckArea, ActionAngle, RelOrbits, OrdEq, RGFund, RootTree do NOT depend on P4.2.
- 6/12 READY papers survive. The d/2 forcing (PathIntNorm) and hbar forcing (HalfDens) would fall.
- Mitigation: P4.2 has been verified by mathematician (BB pre-vote). Levy exclusion argument is solid.

**Scenario C: A single standalone paper is rejected.**
- Impact: MINIMAL. No other paper depends on it.
- Example: if PlanckArea (d=4 sieve) is rejected, nothing else changes.

## 5. Structural Verdict

**Resilience: MODERATE-HIGH.**

- 5/12 READY papers are fully standalone (no companion dependencies)
- 2/12 are ACCEPTED (DeltaObj, DiracProbes) — immune
- The companion-dependent cluster (5 papers) has a single hub (RCPFoundations)
- RCPFoundations is self-contained in content; its vulnerability is the Main reference

**Recommendation:**
1. Publish standalones FIRST (PlanckArea, ActionAngle, RelOrbits) — low risk
2. Publish RCPFoundations SECOND (after Main has at least an arXiv number)
3. Publish companion-dependent cluster THIRD (after RCPFound is public)
4. TangentGroupoid LAST (most dependencies)

## 6. Referee Convergence Patterns

Across all referee reports reviewed in this session:

| Pattern | Frequency | Papers |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| "Companion paper unavailable" | 4/8 reviewed | RCPFound, TanGrp, HalfDens, RootTree |
| "Formula/label error" | 3/8 | OrdEq (LR/Weyl), RootTree (F([[*]])), OrdEq (alpha dim) |
| "Scope overclaim" | 2/8 | OrdEq (OE-P1.1 too broad), RCPFound (P4.2 deferred) |
| "Missing prior art" | 3/8 | OrdEq (von Roos), ActionAngle (Judge), RootTree (Jackiw) |
| "Presentation clarity" | 2/8 | RGFund (RG-D1.4), RCPFound (failure examples) |

**Dominant weakness:** "Companion paper unavailable." This is a STRUCTURAL issue of the corpus, not individual paper quality. Fix: ensure Main/cornerstone has a public preprint before submitting satellites that cite it.

Hypotheses for the d/2 uniqueness-from-composition argument:
- (H1) Semigroup: for all \(t,s>0\), \(K_{t+s}(x,z)=\int_{\mathbb R^d}K_t(x,y)K_s(y,z)\,d^dy\).
- (H2) Translation invariance: \(K_t(x,y)=N(t)h_t(x-y)\), \(h_t\in L^1(\mathbb R^d)\).
- (H3) Fourier measurability/nonvanishing: \(\hat h_t(p)\) is measurable in \(t\) and \(\hat h_t(p)\neq0\) a.e.
- (H4) Mass conservation: \(\int h_t(u)\,d^du=1\) (equiv. \(\hat h_t(0)=1\)).
- (H5) Isotropy + dimensional basis: generator depends on \(|p|\), with only \(\{m,\hbar\}\) as dimensional constants.
- (H6) Quadratic-dispersion branch: local free kernel has nondegenerate quadratic phase/Hessian at short time.

Lemma (measurable multiplicative Cauchy, pointwise in \(p\)):
If \(g:(0,\infty)\to\mathbb C\setminus\{0\}\) is measurable and \(g(t+s)=g(t)g(s)\) for all \(t,s>0\),
then \(g(t)=e^{t\lambda}\) for a unique \(\lambda\in\mathbb C\).
Applied to \(g_p(t):=\hat h_t(p)\), this yields \(\hat h_t(p)=e^{t\varphi(p)}\).

Gap requiring proof (G1):
The step \((H5)+(H6)\Rightarrow \varphi(p)=c|p|^2\) (hence \(N(t)\propto t^{-d/2}\)) is still only argued heuristically;
we need a formal exclusion theorem for all measurable isotropic nonquadratic symbols (e.g. Lévy \(|p|^\alpha,\alpha\neq2\))
under the exact dimensional-constant set \(\{m,\hbar\}\), including complex-time/Fresnel branch control.

### 2026-02-21 self-proposal - mathematician
Target lemma (G1-exclusion, scoped): assume \(\varphi(p)=-c_\alpha|p|^\alpha\), \(\alpha>0\), isotropic.
Dimensional requirement from \(e^{t\varphi}\): \([c_\alpha]=L^\alpha T^{-1}\).
Allowed constants: \([m]=M\), \([\hbar]=ML^2T^{-1}\), so \(m^a\hbar^b\) has dimension \(M^{a+b}L^{2b}T^{-b}\).
Match exponents with \([c_\alpha]\): mass \(a+b=0\), length \(2b=\alpha\), time \(-b=-1\).
Hence \(b=1\), \(a=-1\), and necessarily \(\alpha=2\).
Therefore no monomial/rational dimensional construction from \(\{m,\hbar\}\) can realize \(\alpha\neq2\).
Conclusion: Lévy-stable nonquadratic symbols are excluded in the \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only branch.
Remaining proof duty: extend exclusion from dimensional monomials to all measurable constructions allowed by (H5).

### 2026-02-21 R15B-003
Theorem-ready statement (flat \(d\)-dimensional branch).
Assume (A1) \(K_{t+s}(x,z)=\int_{\mathbb R^d}K_t(x,y)K_s(y,z)\,d^dy\) for all \(t,s>0\).
Assume (A2) \(K_t(x,y)=N(t)h_t(x-y)\), \(h_t\in L^1\), and \(\hat h_t(p)\) is measurable, nonzero a.e.
Assume (A3) mass conservation: \(\hat h_t(0)=1\) for all \(t>0\).
Assume (A4) isotropy and dimensional constants restricted to \(\{m,\hbar\}\).
Assume (A5) quadratic short-time branch: generator \(\varphi(p)=-c|p|^2\) (\(i0\)/Re\(c\)\(\ge0\) branch).
Then \(\hat h_t(p)=e^{t\varphi(p)}\) and \(N(t)=C\,t^{-d/2}\) (constant \(C\) independent of \(t\)).
Hence any ansatz with normalization exponent \(\alpha\neq d/2\) fails semigroup closure for some \(t,s>0\).
Remaining gap (G1): derive quadraticity in (A5) from (A1)-(A4) alone, excluding all measurable isotropic nonquadratic generators.

### 2026-02-21 R15B-009
Minimal assumptions for d/2 uniqueness (tight form):
(M1) Convolution semigroup on \(\mathbb R^d\): \(K_{t+s}=K_t*K_s\), \(t,s>0\), with \(K_t\in L^1\).
(M2) Mass conservation: \(\int_{\mathbb R^d}K_t(x)\,d^dx=1\) (thus \(\widehat K_t(0)=1\)).
(M3) Measurability + nonvanishing: \(t\mapsto \widehat K_t(p)\) measurable and \(\widehat K_t(p)\neq0\) a.e. in \(p\).
(M4) Isotropic quadratic branch fixed by available constants \(\{m,\hbar\}\): \(\phi(p)=-c|p|^2\), \(\Re c\ge0\).
Then \(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{t\phi(p)}\) and inversion gives \(K_t(x)=C\,t^{-d/2}F(|x|^2/t)\), hence exponent \(d/2\).
Equivalently, any normalization \(t^{-\alpha}\) with \(\alpha\neq d/2\) cannot satisfy closure for all \(t,s\).
Residual gap: remove branch assumption in (M4) by proving \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only isotropic generators force \(|p|^2\) uniquely.

### 2026-02-21 R15B-017
Lemma (measurable branch reduction).
Assume (i) \(\widehat K_{t+s}(p)=\widehat K_t(p)\widehat K_s(p)\), (ii) \(t\mapsto \widehat K_t(p)\) measurable, (iii) \(\widehat K_t(p)\neq0\) a.e.
Then for a.e. \(p\) there exists unique \(\phi(p)\in\mathbb C\) with \(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{t\phi(p)}\) for all \(t>0\).
If additionally \(\phi\) is isotropic and in the quadratic branch \(\phi(p)=-c|p|^2\), \(\Re c\ge0\), then
\(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{-tc|p|^2}\) is the unique measurable semigroup branch through \(t=0^+\) with \(\widehat K_t(0)=1\).
Consequently the inverse transform has Gaussian scaling \(K_t(x)=t^{-d/2}\Psi(x/\sqrt t)\), fixing normalization exponent \(d/2\).
Remaining gap: prove quadratic branch selection from pre-branch assumptions only (no prior \(\phi(p)=-c|p|^2\) input).

### 2026-02-21 R15B-023
Proposition (G1 closure, \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only isotropic case).
Assume \(K_{t+s}=K_t*K_s\), \(\widehat K_t(0)=1\), and measurable nonvanishing \(\widehat K_t(p)\).
Then \(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{t\phi(p)}\) a.e. (pointwise measurable Cauchy).
If \(\phi\) is isotropic and dimensionally built only from \(\{m,\hbar\}\), write \(\phi(p)=-c_\alpha|p|^\alpha\).
Since \(t\phi\) is dimensionless: \([c_\alpha]=L^\alpha T^{-1}\).
For \(c_\alpha\sim m^a\hbar^b\): \(a+b=0,\;2b=\alpha,\;-b=-1\Rightarrow b=1,\;a=-1,\;\alpha=2\).
Hence \(\phi(p)=-(\hbar/m)\gamma |p|^2\) (\(\Re\gamma\ge0\)), excluding all \(\alpha\neq2\) isotropic branches.
Inverse Fourier scaling gives \(K_t(x)=t^{-d/2}\Psi(x/\sqrt t)\), so the normalization exponent is uniquely \(d/2\).
Caveat: this closes G1 for monomial/rational dimensional constructions; extend to arbitrary measurable constructions if broader class is admitted.

### 2026-02-21 R15B-022
Minimal formal dependency chain for R15B-017:
(D1) Semigroup + measurability + nonvanishing:
\(\widehat K_{t+s}(p)=\widehat K_t(p)\widehat K_s(p)\Rightarrow \widehat K_t(p)=e^{t\phi(p)}\) a.e. in \(p\).
(D2) Mass conservation: \(\widehat K_t(0)=1\Rightarrow \phi(0)=0\).
(D3) Isotropy + \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only constants \(\Rightarrow \phi(p)=-c_\alpha|p|^\alpha\), \([c_\alpha]=L^\alpha T^{-1}\).
(D4) Dimensional matching with \(c_\alpha\sim m^a\hbar^b\):
\(a+b=0,\;2b=\alpha,\;-b=-1\Rightarrow \alpha=2,\;c_2=(\hbar/m)\gamma\).
(D5) Therefore \(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{-t(\hbar/m)\gamma|p|^2}\Rightarrow K_t(x)=t^{-d/2}\Psi(x/\sqrt t)\).
Conclusion: R15B-017 depends on D1->D2->D3->D4->D5; unique normalization exponent is \(d/2\).

### 2026-02-21 R15B-025
Independent check of R15B-024 verdict:
- Verified `paper/main.md` lines 660 and 672: directional words are already removed; label-only refs remain.
- So the proposal diff in `proposals/task-xref-check.md` is now a no-op (superseded), not pending apply.
- Critic policy verdict is sound: avoid scope-ambiguous "zero sev-1 errors" phrasing.
- Preferred form remains: "no sev-1 defects found in audited subset (type, count, date)".
- Keep explicit caveat when coverage is partial: risk outside audited subset remains open.
- Independent verdict: guidance READY; patch artifact CLOSED/SUPERSEDED.

## 2026-02-21 R15B-014
Minimal assumption chain for theoremizing the d/2 branch:
A1) Composition semigroup on kernels: K_{t+s}=K_t*K_s with positivity and normalization.
A2) Spatial isotropy + translation invariance: symbol depends only on |p|.
A3) Scale covariance of measure map under x->lambda x fixes kernel mass-dimension.
A4) Half-density transport law under coordinate change preserves L^2 pairing.
A5) Generator is local second-order elliptic (exclude Levy/nonlocal tails).
Then kernel prefactor must scale as t^{-d/2}; any exponent !=d/2 breaks A1+A3.
So d/2 is forced kinematically, while a specific value d=4 needs extra dynamics.

### 2026-02-21 R15B-036
Mathematician end-state (d/2 uniqueness obligations):
Resolved: semigroup+measurability gives \(\widehat K_t=e^{t\phi}\) (R15B-017).
Resolved: \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-dimensional matching excludes \(\alpha\neq2\) in isotropic \(|p|^\alpha\) branch (R15B-023).
Resolved: dependency chain D1->D5 is minimal and explicit (R15B-022).
Open: upgrade exclusion from monomial/rational dimensional constructions to all admissible measurable constructions.
Open: formalize branch/regularity hypotheses (positivity, continuity class, domain) as theorem assumptions, not prose.
Status: theorem-ready core complete; one generality-extension lemma remains.
