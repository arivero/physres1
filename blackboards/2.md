## 1. Core Idea (Refinement Compatibility Principle)

**Slogan:** Physical laws are those that survive controlled changes of partition, representation, and scale.

**Operational form:** A prediction \(\mathcal{O}_{h,\theta}\) (at ruler \(h\), with parameters \(\theta\)) is **compatible** if, for every refinement operation, there exists a parameter update \(\tau\) such that the post-operation result is representable in the same family:
\[
\mathcal{O}_{h,\theta} = \mathcal{O}_{h,\tau(\theta)} \circ \mathcal{T},
\]
where \(\mathcal{T}\) is a transformation (partition refinement, representation change, scale shift).

## 2. Three Compatibility Channels

### Channel 1: Partition compatibility (temporal composition)
**Operation:** Subdivide time interval \([0,T]\) into finer steps.
**Example:** \(N\) steps of size \(h = T/N\) → \(2N\) steps of size \(h/2\).
**Compatibility:** Composed fine-step prediction = single coarse-step prediction.
**Witness:** P4.2 (composition forces \(\hbar\), d/2 normalization).

### Channel 2: Representation compatibility (ordering/gauge)
**Operation:** Change quantum ordering prescription (Weyl → Born-Jordan → symmetric, etc.).
**Example:** \(Q_L\) (left-ordered) vs \(Q_W\) (Weyl-ordered) for same classical symbol.
**Compatibility:** All orderings agree in \(\hbar \to 0\) limit, differ by O(\(\hbar\)) corrections.
**Witness:** Section 10.2 (f(q)p example, domain data transport).

### Channel 3: Scale compatibility (RG flow)
**Operation:** Change UV cutoff \(\Lambda_1 \to \Lambda_2\) (or subtraction scale \(\mu_1 \to \mu_2\)).
**Example:** Renormalized coupling \(g_R(\mu_1) \to g_R(\mu_2)\) via beta function.
**Compatibility:** Observable predictions independent of \(\mu\) after coupling update.
**Witness:** Section 10.5 (2D delta beta function, RG-invariant \(\kappa_*\)).

## 3. Commuting Diagram Template

```
         Partition Refinement
    O_{h,θ} ──────────────────→ O_{h/2,τ_C(θ)}
       │                              │
  Repr │                              │ Repr
  change│                              │ change
       ↓                              ↓
    O_{h,τ_Q(θ)} ──────────────→ O_{h/2,τ_C∘τ_Q(θ)}
```

**Compatibility = diagram commutes:** Path "refine then represent" = path "represent then refine".

## 4. Minimal Axiom List (5 axioms)

**A1 (Composition law):** For partition refinement, \(\mathcal{O}_{T,\theta} = \mathcal{O}_{t_1,\theta'} \circ \mathcal{O}_{t_2,\theta''}\) with \(T = t_1 + t_2\).

**A2 (Identity limit):** As refinement → trivial (e.g., \(h \to 0\), or \(\mu \to \mu\)), \(\tau(\theta) \to \theta\).

**A3 (Representation equivalence):** For any two representations \(R_1, R_2\) with same classical limit, there exists \(\tau_{R_1 \to R_2}\) such that predictions agree.

**A4 (Scale invariance):** Observable predictions \(\mathcal{O}_{\text{phys}}\) satisfy \(\mathcal{O}_{\text{phys}} = \mathcal{O}_{\text{phys}} \circ \mathcal{R}_{\mu \to \mu'}\) after parameter flow \(\theta(\mu) \to \theta(\mu')\).

**A5 (Dimensional homogeneity, optional):** All parameters \(\theta\) and scales (h, \(\mu\), \(\Lambda\)) have dimensions built from a finite set of fundamental constants.

**Theorem (P4.2 as RCP witness):** Under A1, A2, A5, partition-compatible action-based dynamics force a structural constant \(\kappa\) with \([\kappa] = [\text{action}]\), and both \(\kappa \to 0\) and \(\kappa \to \infty\) limits fail.

## 5. Worked Example: Noether's Theorem (Partition Channel)

### 5a. Setup
Action functional:
\[
S[q] = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} L(q(t), \dot{q}(t), t) \, dt.
\]

One-parameter symmetry group \(\{g_s\}\) acting on paths: \(q(t) \to q_s(t) = g_s \cdot q(t)\).

**Infinitesimal generator:** \(\delta q(t) = \frac{d}{ds}\Big|_{s=0} q_s(t) = \xi(q(t), t)\).

### 5b. Symmetry Condition
\(S[q_s] = S[q]\) for all \(s\) ⟹ \(\delta S = 0\).

Variation:
\[
\delta S = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} \delta q + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \delta \dot{q} \right) dt.
\]

Integrate by parts:
\[
\delta S = \left[ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \delta q \right]_{t_0}^{t_1} + \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right) \delta q \, dt.
\]

### 5c. Noether's Theorem
**Statement:** If \(\delta S = 0\) for all paths (not just extremal), then the **Noether charge**
\[
Q := \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \xi(q, t)
\]
is conserved: \(\frac{dQ}{dt} = 0\) along extremal paths satisfying Euler-Lagrange equations.

**Proof:** On extremal paths, the Euler-Lagrange term vanishes. The boundary term must also vanish (since \(\delta S = 0\) for all paths, not just fixed-endpoint). Hence:
\[
0 = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \cdot \xi \right) = \frac{dQ}{dt}.
\]

### 5d. RCP Interpretation (Partition Compatibility)
**Partition refinement:** Subdivide \([t_0, t_1]\) into \(N\) intervals \(\{[t_k, t_{k+1}]\}\).

Discrete action:
\[
S_N[q] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} L\!\left(q_k, \frac{q_{k+1} - q_k}{\Delta t}, t_k\right) \Delta t.
\]

Symmetry \(q_k \to q_{k,s} = g_s \cdot q_k\) gives discrete Noether charge:
\[
Q_k = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\Big|_{q_k} \cdot \xi(q_k, t_k).
\]

**Compatibility:** As \(N \to \infty\) (refinement \(\Delta t \to 0\)), discrete \(Q_k\) converges to continuum \(Q(t)\), and conservation \(Q_k = Q_{k+1}\) (discrete) → \(dQ/dt = 0\) (continuum).

**RCP witness:** Noether charge is the **compatibility datum** \(\tau_C(\theta)\) that makes symmetry survive partition refinement. The parameter bundle \(\theta\) includes both the Lagrangian and the conserved charge \(Q\). Changing partition (coarse → fine) requires updating the discrete charge formula to maintain closure.

## 6. Additional Examples (Deferred to C-Cycle)

### 6a. Weak Euler-Lagrange (Partition)
Action extrema under partition refinement → weak formulation with delta forcing.

### 6b. Ordering Equivalence (Representation)
\(f(q)p\) example from Section 10.2: Weyl vs Born-Jordan, O(\(\hbar\)) shift.

### 6c. RG Beta Function (Scale)
2D delta from Section 10.5: \(\mu \, dg_R/d\mu = (m/\pi\hbar^2) g_R^2\).
