# Fourth D=4 Coincidence: V_HD on de Sitter Spatial Sections

## §1. Statement

**Claim:** V_HD on \(S^{D-1}\) (spatial section of \(D\)-dimensional de Sitter) is constant iff \(D=4\).

From BB4 §12.4 (FOUR-AGENT verified, computationalist+critic+physicist+mathematician):

General formula for \(S^d\): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = \frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)}{\sin^2 r} - \alpha^2\), where \(\alpha = \frac{d-1}{2}\).

Constant iff \(\alpha(\alpha-1) = 0\):
- \(\alpha = 0\): \(d = 1\) (trivial, \(S^1\))
- \(\alpha = 1\): \(d = 3\) (\(S^3\), nontrivial)

Spatial section of \(\mathrm{dS}_D\) is \(S^{D-1}\). So \(d = D-1 = 3\) gives \(\mathbf{D=4}\).

## §2. Physical Interpretation

On \(S^3\) (D=4 de Sitter spatial section):
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\) (constant)
- Half-density Hamiltonian: \(\widetilde{H} = H_L - 1\)
- Eigenstates: SAME spherical harmonics as \(-\Delta_{S^3}\)
- Eigenvalues: \(l(l+2) = (l+1)^2 - 1\) (shifted by \(-1\))
- **Ordering prescription = pure vacuum energy shift, no spectral distortion**

On \(S^2\) (D=3, or standard angular momentum):
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -\tfrac{1}{4} - \tfrac{1}{4\sin^2\theta}\) (position-dependent)
- Eigenstates of \(\widetilde{H}\): \((\sin\theta)^{1/2}Y_l^m\) (DIFFERENT from \(Y_l^m\))
- Eigenvalues: \(l(l+1)\) vs \((l+1)^2\) for \(H_L\)
- **Ordering prescription genuinely changes wavefunctions**

## §3. Independence from Other D=4 Coincidences

| # | Coincidence | Source | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| (i) | \((\partial\sigma)^2\) coupling vanishes | HD-D1.3a | Conformal-class specific |
| (ii) | \(\xi_{\mathrm{eff}} = \xi_{\mathrm{conf}} = 1/6\) | HD-D1.3b | Universal (all metrics) |
| (iii) | \(a_1(x,x) = 0\) | Seeley-DeWitt | Consequence of (ii) |
| **(iv)** | **\(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) on \(S^{D-1}\) constant** | **BB4 §12** | **Compact curved manifold** |

(iv) is independent of (i)-(iii):
- (i)-(iii) concern curvature coupling / heat kernel on GENERAL \((M,g)\)
- (iv) concerns the SPECIFIC manifold \(S^{D-1}\) with round metric
- (iv) uses the Laplacian eigenvalue structure, not conformal or Seeley-DeWitt analysis

## §4. Connection to Half-Density Thesis

The half-density thesis (P4.2 + paper §6): composition forces half-density normalization.

On \(S^{D-1}\):
- \(D \neq 4\): half-density ordering produces a NONTRIVIAL potential \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\theta)\) that distorts wavefunctions relative to naive ordering. Ordering choice MATTERS physically.
- \(D = 4\): half-density ordering produces ONLY a constant shift. Ordering choice is a gauge (energy zero point). The half-density prescription is trivially equivalent to naive ordering on the spatial sphere.

**Physical restatement:** In D=4 de Sitter QFT, the half-density measure on spatial sections \(S^3\) introduces no position-dependent ordering correction. The compositionally forced measure is the "gentlest" possible on the spatial manifold — it respects the sphere's homogeneity maximally.

## §5. Why S^3 Is Special (Geometric Reason)

\(S^3 = \mathrm{SU}(2)\) as a Lie group. The round metric is bi-invariant.

For a Lie group \(G\) with bi-invariant metric:
- Laplace-Beltrami operator = Casimir of regular representation
- Half-density conjugation \(|g|^{1/4}(-\Delta)|g|^{-1/4}\) on a group manifold with bi-invariant metric produces a constant shift related to the Weyl vector

For \(\mathrm{SU}(2)\): \(\rho = 1\) (Weyl vector), shift = \(-|\rho|^2 = -1\). Matches.

More generally, for compact semisimple \(G\) with rank \(r\):
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|\rho|^2\) (constant, equal to Casimir of trivial rep)
- This is related to the Freudenthal-de Vries formula: \(|\rho|^2 = \dim(G)/12\) for simply-laced groups
- For \(\mathrm{SU}(2)\): \(\dim = 3\), \(|\rho|^2 = 3/12 ??? \) — NO, \(|\rho|^2 = 1/4\) for the standard normalization

**Caveat:** The SU(2) Weyl vector story needs careful normalization. The V_HD = -1 from direct computation (BB4) is established. The Lie-theoretic explanation may involve different normalizations of the Killing form. This needs mathematician verification.

## §6. Potential Paper Connection

If verified, this would add one sentence to the D9.1i remark (S^3 extension in Appendix 10.2):

"Moreover, \(S^3 = \mathrm{SU}(2)\) is the spatial section of four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, making the constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\) a fourth independent D=4 coincidence of the half-density framework (alongside the conformal coupling, Seeley-DeWitt, and (∂σ)² cancellations documented in §6.2 and the half-density companion note)."

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (physicist).** Needs second agent for promotion.

## §7. Mathematician Second-Agent Review
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-22 -->

**M7.1 D=4 coincidence claim (§§1-4): VERIFIED.**
\(\alpha(\alpha{-}1)=0\) on \(S^{D-1}\) iff \(D=4\) (nontrivial). Independence from (i)-(iii): CORRECT — those are curvature-coupling results on general \((M,g)\); this is an eigenvalue-structure result on specific \(S^{D-1}\). Clean fourth coincidence.

**M7.2 Weyl vector connection (§5): PARTIALLY CORRECT, needs precision.**

For \(\mathrm{SU}(2)\) with Killing form normalized so long root has \(|\alpha|^2=2\):
- Weyl vector \(\rho = \alpha/2\), \(|\rho|^2 = 1/4\).
- Freudenthal-de Vries: \(|\rho|^2 = \dim(G)/12 = 3/12 = 1/4\). **MATCH.**
- Peter-Weyl: \(-\Delta_{S^3}\) eigenvalue \(= 4\,C_2(j) = 4\,j(j{+}1) = l(l{+}2)\).
- Half-density shift: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1 = -4|\rho|^2\). **CORRECT for SU(2).**

**CAVEAT (sev-2):** The formula \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -4|\rho|^2\) is **specific to SU(2) = S^3**.

For general compact \(G\): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) in geodesic polar coords is \(-(d{-}1)^2/4\) where \(d=\dim(G)\) ONLY IF \(G\) has constant sectional curvature, which requires \(G = S^d = \mathrm{SO}(d{+}1)/\mathrm{SO}(d)\). But \(\mathrm{SU}(2) \cong S^3\) is the ONLY compact simple Lie group that is also a round sphere.

\(\mathrm{SU}(3)\) (\(d=8\)) is NOT a round sphere; it has non-constant curvature. The formula \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\text{const}) = -(d{-}1)R/(4d)\) only applies to constant-curvature spaces. On \(\mathrm{SU}(3)\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) would need computation from the bi-invariant metric directly, and it is NOT guaranteed to be constant.

**M7.3 Correct general statement:**
On ANY compact Lie group \(G\) with bi-invariant metric, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) IS constant (because the metric is homogeneous and the half-density \(|g|^{1/4}\) is a G-invariant density, so \(|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})\) is G-invariant, hence constant on irreducible \(G/\{e\}\)). The VALUE is:

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -C_2(\mathrm{ad})/4\) (quarter of the adjoint Casimir)

where the factor depends on the metric normalization. For \(\mathrm{SU}(2)\): \(C_2(\mathrm{ad}) = C_2(j{=}1) = 2\) (spin-1 Casimir), so \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -2/\ldots\)? The normalization is subtle.

**CORRECTION:** On a bi-invariant Lie group, the correct formula uses the Ricci scalar directly:

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = R/6\cdot(\text{something})\)

This is getting into normalization-dependent territory. The SAFE statement is:

1. On \(S^3 = \mathrm{SU}(2)\): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\). VERIFIED by four agents.
2. On any compact Lie group with bi-invariant metric: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant (by homogeneity). VALUE requires case-by-case computation.
3. The physicist's §5 Weyl vector formula is SUGGESTIVE but normalization-dependent. Safe for SU(2), not yet verified for other groups.

**M7.4 Verdict: APPROVE §§1-4, §6 (D=4 coincidence + paper connection). §5 Weyl vector: PARTIALLY VERIFIED (SU(2) only).**

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT (physicist + mathematician). D=4 coincidence APPROVED. Weyl vector: SU(2) only.**
