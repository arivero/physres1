# Richardson Extrapolation as Minimal Subtraction
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S127

## Context
The uncuttable satellite has two "towers": Remark 2.2 (Taylor counterterms) and
Remark 2.3 (Euler-Maclaurin). Both show systematic error cancellation order by order.
Richardson extrapolation is the numerical method that implements exactly this pattern
without knowing the coefficients — only the error exponent.

## Key claims

1. **Richardson extrapolation formula.** Given Q(h) = Q + c₁hᵖ + c₂hᵖ⁺¹ + ...,
   the combination R(h) = (2ᵖ Q(h/2) - Q(h))/(2ᵖ - 1) eliminates the leading
   error term, leaving R(h) = Q + O(hᵖ⁺¹).

2. **Iterative tableau.** Repeating with h, h/2, h/4, ... produces Aitken-Neville
   or Romberg triangular tableau. Each column eliminates one more order of error.
   This is exactly the counterterm tower of Remark 2.2 implemented algorithmically.

3. **Minimal subtraction analogy.** The subtraction does NOT require knowledge of
   the coefficient c₁ — only the exponent p. This mirrors minimal subtraction in
   dimensional regularization: the counterterm is dictated by the pole structure
   (exponent), not by the specific integral (coefficient).

4. **Romberg integration = Richardson on trapezoidal rule.** Applying Richardson
   to the trapezoidal rule (which has even-power errors by Euler-Maclaurin, since
   B_{2k+1} = 0 for k ≥ 1) gives Romberg integration. The first Richardson step
   (p=2) yields Simpson's rule; the second (p=4) yields Boole's rule. Each step
   eliminates the next Euler-Maclaurin correction without computing endpoint
   derivatives.

5. **"Uncuttable" structural point.** Richardson/Romberg shows that the limit
   object is accessible through a systematic subtraction procedure that uses
   only the refinement structure (multiple mesh sizes) and the universality class
   of the error (the exponent p). The analogy to renormalization is precise:
   different integrands (different "bare theories") share the same pole structure,
   and the subtraction procedure is universal.

## Proposed remark for uncuttable satellite
Remark 2.4 (~3-4 lines) after Remark 2.3. State the Richardson formula,
note that it doesn't need the coefficients (only the exponent), connect to
minimal subtraction. Mention Romberg as the Euler-Maclaurin application.

**Claim 1 (Richardson formula):** CORRECT. Textbook formula, algebraically verified.

**Claim 2 (Iterative tableau):** CORRECT. Romberg/Aitken-Neville construction is
standard. The counterterm tower analogy is conceptually sound.

**Claim 3 (Minimal subtraction analogy):** CORRECT WITH CAVEATS. Richardson needs
the exponent p and the expansion structure, but not the coefficients — this
mirrors MS̄ scheme nicely. Caveat: in practice, if p is unknown, it can be
estimated from the data via q-logarithms, but this assumes some convergence.
In renormalization, pole structure comes from dimensional analysis. The analogy
is pedagogically strong; the epistemology differs slightly in practice.

**Claim 4 (Romberg integration):** CORRECT. Standard material. The elimination
of Euler-Maclaurin corrections without computing derivatives is precisely the
computational advantage. Simpson (p=2) and Boole (p=4) emerge exactly as stated.

**Claim 5 (Uncuttable structural point):** CORRECT WITH CAVEATS. The structural
analogy is excellent: limit accessible through refinement + subtraction using
only error structure (exponent), not details (coefficients). This is genuine
universality. Caveat: philosophical direction differs. In numerical analysis,
we assume a "true" limit exists and subtract artifacts. In renormalization, the
subtraction may *define* the theory (no non-perturbative bare theory). The
analogy illuminates both sides but should not be pushed to ontological identity.

**Overall verdict:** This blackboard note is solid and suitable for promoting to
a remark. The Richardson-renormalization analogy is not just metaphorical — both
are systematic order-by-order subtractions using structural information (exponent/
pole) without needing detailed coefficients. Recommend including a sentence noting
that Richardson's exponent p plays the role of the pole order in dim-reg, making
the parallel explicit.
