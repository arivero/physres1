# Fourth D=4 Coincidence: V_HD on de Sitter Spatial Sections

## §1. Statement

**Claim:** V_HD on \(S^{D-1}\) (spatial section of \(D\)-dimensional de Sitter) is constant iff \(D=4\).

From BB4 §12.4 (FOUR-AGENT verified, computationalist+critic+physicist+mathematician):

General formula for \(S^d\): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = \frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)}{\sin^2 r} - \alpha^2\), where \(\alpha = \frac{d-1}{2}\).

Constant iff \(\alpha(\alpha-1) = 0\):
- \(\alpha = 0\): \(d = 1\) (trivial, \(S^1\))
- \(\alpha = 1\): \(d = 3\) (\(S^3\), nontrivial)

Spatial section of \(\mathrm{dS}_D\) is \(S^{D-1}\). So \(d = D-1 = 3\) gives \(\mathbf{D=4}\).

## §2. Physical Interpretation

On \(S^3\) (D=4 de Sitter spatial section):
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\) (constant)
- Half-density Hamiltonian: \(\widetilde{H} = H_L - 1\)
- Eigenstates: SAME spherical harmonics as \(-\Delta_{S^3}\)
- Eigenvalues: \(l(l+2) = (l+1)^2 - 1\) (shifted by \(-1\))
- **Ordering prescription = pure vacuum energy shift, no spectral distortion**

On \(S^2\) (D=3, or standard angular momentum):
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -\tfrac{1}{4} - \tfrac{1}{4\sin^2\theta}\) (position-dependent)
- Eigenstates of \(\widetilde{H}\): \((\sin\theta)^{1/2}Y_l^m\) (DIFFERENT from \(Y_l^m\))
- Eigenvalues: \(l(l+1)\) vs \((l+1)^2\) for \(H_L\)
- **Ordering prescription genuinely changes wavefunctions**

## §3. Independence from Other D=4 Coincidences

| # | Coincidence | Source | Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| (i) | \((\partial\sigma)^2\) coupling vanishes | HD-D1.3a | Conformal-class specific |
| (ii) | \(\xi_{\mathrm{eff}} = \xi_{\mathrm{conf}} = 1/6\) | HD-D1.3b | Universal (all metrics) |
| (iii) | \(a_1(x,x) = 0\) | Seeley-DeWitt | Consequence of (ii) |
| **(iv)** | **\(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) on \(S^{D-1}\) constant** | **BB4 §12** | **Compact curved manifold** |

(iv) is independent of (i)-(iii):
- (i)-(iii) concern curvature coupling / heat kernel on GENERAL \((M,g)\)
- (iv) concerns the SPECIFIC manifold \(S^{D-1}\) with round metric
- (iv) uses the Laplacian eigenvalue structure, not conformal or Seeley-DeWitt analysis

## §4. Connection to Half-Density Thesis

The half-density thesis (P4.2 + paper §6): composition forces half-density normalization.

On \(S^{D-1}\):
- \(D \neq 4\): half-density ordering produces a NONTRIVIAL potential \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\theta)\) that distorts wavefunctions relative to naive ordering. Ordering choice MATTERS physically.
- \(D = 4\): half-density ordering produces ONLY a constant shift. Ordering choice is a gauge (energy zero point). The half-density prescription is trivially equivalent to naive ordering on the spatial sphere.

**Physical restatement:** In D=4 de Sitter QFT, the half-density measure on spatial sections \(S^3\) introduces no position-dependent ordering correction. The compositionally forced measure is the "gentlest" possible on the spatial manifold — it respects the sphere's homogeneity maximally.

## §5. Why S^3 Is Special (Geometric Reason)

\(S^3 = \mathrm{SU}(2)\) as a Lie group. The round metric is bi-invariant.

For a Lie group \(G\) with bi-invariant metric:
- Laplace-Beltrami operator = Casimir of regular representation
- Half-density conjugation \(|g|^{1/4}(-\Delta)|g|^{-1/4}\) on a group manifold with bi-invariant metric produces a constant shift related to the Weyl vector

For \(\mathrm{SU}(2)\): \(\rho = 1\) (Weyl vector), shift = \(-|\rho|^2 = -1\). Matches.

More generally, for compact semisimple \(G\) with rank \(r\):
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|\rho|^2\) (constant, equal to Casimir of trivial rep)
- This is related to the Freudenthal-de Vries formula: \(|\rho|^2 = \dim(G)/12\) for simply-laced groups
- For \(\mathrm{SU}(2)\): \(\dim = 3\), \(|\rho|^2 = 3/12 ??? \) — NO, \(|\rho|^2 = 1/4\) for the standard normalization

**Caveat:** The SU(2) Weyl vector story needs careful normalization. The V_HD = -1 from direct computation (BB4) is established. The Lie-theoretic explanation may involve different normalizations of the Killing form. This needs mathematician verification.

## §6. Potential Paper Connection

If verified, this would add one sentence to the D9.1i remark (S^3 extension in Appendix 10.2):

"Moreover, \(S^3 = \mathrm{SU}(2)\) is the spatial section of four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, making the constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\) a fourth independent D=4 coincidence of the half-density framework (alongside the conformal coupling, Seeley-DeWitt, and (∂σ)² cancellations documented in §6.2 and the half-density companion note)."

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (physicist).** Needs second agent for promotion.

## §7. Mathematician Second-Agent Review
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-22 -->

**M7.1 D=4 coincidence claim (§§1-4): VERIFIED.**
\(\alpha(\alpha{-}1)=0\) on \(S^{D-1}\) iff \(D=4\) (nontrivial). Independence from (i)-(iii): CORRECT — those are curvature-coupling results on general \((M,g)\); this is an eigenvalue-structure result on specific \(S^{D-1}\). Clean fourth coincidence.

**M7.2 Weyl vector connection (§5): PARTIALLY CORRECT, needs precision.**

For \(\mathrm{SU}(2)\) with Killing form normalized so long root has \(|\alpha|^2=2\):
- Weyl vector \(\rho = \alpha/2\), \(|\rho|^2 = 1/4\).
- Freudenthal-de Vries: \(|\rho|^2 = \dim(G)/12 = 3/12 = 1/4\). **MATCH.**
- Peter-Weyl: \(-\Delta_{S^3}\) eigenvalue \(= 4\,C_2(j) = 4\,j(j{+}1) = l(l{+}2)\).
- Half-density shift: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1 = -4|\rho|^2\). **CORRECT for SU(2).**

**CAVEAT (sev-2):** The formula \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -4|\rho|^2\) is **specific to SU(2) = S^3**.

For general compact \(G\): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) in geodesic polar coords is \(-(d{-}1)^2/4\) where \(d=\dim(G)\) ONLY IF \(G\) has constant sectional curvature, which requires \(G = S^d = \mathrm{SO}(d{+}1)/\mathrm{SO}(d)\). But \(\mathrm{SU}(2) \cong S^3\) is the ONLY compact simple Lie group that is also a round sphere.

\(\mathrm{SU}(3)\) (\(d=8\)) is NOT a round sphere; it has non-constant curvature. The formula \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\text{const}) = -(d{-}1)R/(4d)\) only applies to constant-curvature spaces. On \(\mathrm{SU}(3)\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) would need computation from the bi-invariant metric directly, and it is NOT guaranteed to be constant.

**M7.3 Correct general statement:**
On ANY compact Lie group \(G\) with bi-invariant metric, \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) IS constant (because the metric is homogeneous and the half-density \(|g|^{1/4}\) is a G-invariant density, so \(|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g(|g|^{-1/4})\) is G-invariant, hence constant on irreducible \(G/\{e\}\)). The VALUE is:

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -C_2(\mathrm{ad})/4\) (quarter of the adjoint Casimir)

where the factor depends on the metric normalization. For \(\mathrm{SU}(2)\): \(C_2(\mathrm{ad}) = C_2(j{=}1) = 2\) (spin-1 Casimir), so \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -2/\ldots\)? The normalization is subtle.

**CORRECTION:** On a bi-invariant Lie group, the correct formula uses the Ricci scalar directly:

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = R/6\cdot(\text{something})\)

This is getting into normalization-dependent territory. The SAFE statement is:

1. On \(S^3 = \mathrm{SU}(2)\): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\). VERIFIED by four agents.
2. On any compact Lie group with bi-invariant metric: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant (by homogeneity). VALUE requires case-by-case computation.
3. The physicist's §5 Weyl vector formula is SUGGESTIVE but normalization-dependent. Safe for SU(2), not yet verified for other groups.

**M7.4 Verdict: APPROVE §§1-4, §6 (D=4 coincidence + paper connection). §5 Weyl vector: PARTIALLY VERIFIED (SU(2) only).**

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT (physicist + mathematician). D=4 coincidence APPROVED. Weyl vector: SU(2) only.**

## §8. Critic Third-Agent Review
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-22 -->

**C8.1 Core claim (§1): VERIFIED (independent SymPy computation).**
\(\alpha(\alpha{-}1)=0\) for \(\alpha=(d{-}1)/2\) gives \(d=1\) (trivial) or \(d=3\).
De Sitter spatial section \(S^{D-1}\) gives \(D=4\). Checked all \(d=1,\ldots,7\). CORRECT.

**C8.2 Eigenvalue identity (§2): VERIFIED.**
\(l(l+2) = (l{+}1)^2 - 1\) for all \(l\ge0\). Confirmed \(l=0,\ldots,5\). CORRECT.

**C8.3 Independence from (i)-(iii) (§3): VERIFIED with precision.**
Potential concern: could (iv) follow from (ii) \(\xi_{\mathrm{eff}}=\xi_{\mathrm{conf}}\) in \(D=4\)?
NO. The conformal coupling in spatial dimension \(d=3\) is \(\xi_c = (d{-}2)/(4(d{-}1)) = 1/8\).
\(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\mathrm{const})/R = -(d{-}1)/(4d) = -1/6\). These are NEVER equal for any integer \(d\):
\(-(d{-}1)/(4d) = (d{-}2)/(4(d{-}1))\) yields \(2d^2-4d+1=0\), roots \(d\approx1.71, 0.29\).
Independence CONFIRMED.

**C8.4 Physical interpretation (§4): CORRECT.**
"Gentlest possible" = no position-dependent correction. This is a clean statement.
Caveat: "gauge" for constant energy shift is only valid for non-relativistic single-particle QM
(where energy zero is arbitrary). In QFT the vacuum energy has physical consequences (cosmological constant).
This is sev-4 (worth noting in the paper remark, not blocking).

**C8.5 Weyl vector story (§5, §M7.2-7.3): CONCUR with mathematician.**
\(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1 = -4|\rho|^2_{\mathrm{FdV}}\) on SU(2): CORRECT.
Extension to general compact \(G\): constant by homogeneity, value requires case-by-case.
Safe statement in M7.3 item (1)-(3): AGREED.

**C8.6 Proposed paper sentence (§6): APPROVE.**
The sentence is accurate and appropriately scoped. Consistent with the independence result.

**C8.7 Unified formula cross-check (from BB6 §5):**
\(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\mathrm{const}) = -(d{-}1)R/(4d)\). Verified on \(S^2,S^3,S^4,S^5,H^2,H^3\): all match.
Consistency between BB2 and BB6 confirmed.

**Verdict: APPROVE. No errors found. sev-4 note on vacuum energy interpretation.**

**STATUS: THREE-AGENT (physicist + mathematician + critic). UNANIMOUS APPROVE.**

## §9. Fifth D=4 Coincidence: \(a_2(\Delta_{1/2}; S^3) = 0\) and the de Sitter Partition Function
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-22 -->
<!-- Connects: BB4 §10 (a_1=0 universal), notebook seeley-dewitt-a1-zero.md §5-§6, BB0 (Lie groups) -->

### §9.1. The \(a_2\) Formula on \(S^d\)

From BB4 (computationalist, THREE-AGENT verified):
\[a_2(\Delta_{1/2}; S^d) = -\frac{d(d-1)(d-3)}{180}\]

Vanishes iff \(d \in \{0, 1, 3\}\). Only \(d = 3\) is nontrivial.

Combined with \(a_1 = 0\) (universal, Thm M4.1):

**On \(S^3\):** \(a_0 = 1\), \(a_1 = 0\), \(a_2 = 0\). First nonzero curvature correction is \(a_3\).

### §9.2. The de Sitter Partition Function

Euclidean dS\(_4\) spatial section = \(S^3\) of radius \(a(t)\). Static de Sitter: \(a = H^{-1}\), \(R_{S^3} = 6H^2\).

**One-loop partition function** of half-density scalar on \(S^3\):
\[Z_1 = \bigl[\det'(\Delta_{1/2})\bigr]^{-1/2}\]
where \(\det'\) excludes the zero mode (\(l=0\): eigenvalue \(l(l+2)=0\)).

**Spectral zeta function:**
\[\zeta(s) = \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (l+1)^2\,[l(l+2)]^{-s} = \sum_{l=1}^{\infty} (l+1)^2\,[(l+1)^2 - 1]^{-s}\]

In \(d=3\) (odd): **no pole at \(s=0\)**. The functional determinant is FINITE — no log divergence. This is a general odd-\(d\) fact, independent of the \(a_k\).

### §9.3. What \(a_1 = a_2 = 0\) Controls: Radius Dependence

Under \(g \to \lambda^2 g\) (radius scaling \(a \to \lambda a\)):

\[\ln \det(\Delta_{1/2}; \lambda^2 g) = \ln \det(\Delta_{1/2}; g) + \sum_{k=0}^{(d-1)/2} c_k \,a_k \,\ln\lambda\]

(In odd \(d\), the conformal anomaly vanishes but the log-scaling receives finite contributions from the \(a_k\) with \(k \le (d-1)/2\).)

For \(d = 3\): relevant coefficients are \(a_0\), \(a_1\). Since \(a_1 = 0\):

\[\ln \det(\Delta_{1/2}; \lambda^2 g) = \ln \det(\Delta_{1/2}; g) + c_0\,\mathrm{Vol}(S^3)\,\ln\lambda\]

The ONLY radius-dependent term in the one-loop effective action is the volume (cosmological constant) piece. **No \(R \cdot \ln a\) contribution.** The curvature coupling does not run with the radius.

**Contrast with minimal coupling (\(\xi = 0\)):** \(a_1 = R/6 \neq 0\). The minimally coupled scalar has a curvature-dependent radius scaling in its partition function.

**Contrast with conformal coupling in \(d=3\) (\(\xi_c = 1/8\)):** \(a_1 = R/6 - R/8 = R/24 \neq 0\). Even the conformally coupled scalar has nonzero \(a_1\) on \(S^3\).

### §9.4. Comparison Table

| Coupling | \(\xi\) | \(a_1\) on \(S^3\) | \(a_2\) on \(S^3\) | Radius log-scaling |
|----------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| Minimal | 0 | \(R/6 = 1\) | nonzero | \(R\)-dependent |
| Conformal (\(d=3\)) | \(1/8\) | \(R/24 = 1/4\) | nonzero | \(R\)-dependent |
| **Half-density** | **\(1/6\)** | **0** | **0** | **Volume only** |

The half-density scalar is the CLEANEST free scalar on \(S^3\): no curvature corrections to the partition function until \(O(R^3)\).

### §9.5. Physical Interpretation

**9.5.1 Vacuum energy in de Sitter.** The Bunch-Davies vacuum energy of a scalar in dS\(_4\) receives curvature corrections from the \(a_k\). With \(a_1 = a_2 = 0\), the leading curvature correction is \(O(H^6)\) (from \(a_3\)). The Hubble-scale corrections \(O(H^2)\) and \(O(H^4)\) are ABSENT for the half-density scalar.

This means: in the composition-forced quantization, the de Sitter vacuum energy is maximally insensitive to the Hubble scale. The only contributions are the quartic UV divergence (cosmological constant, from \(a_0\)) and subleading \(O(H^6)\) terms.

**9.5.2 Relation to the cosmological constant problem.** This does NOT solve the CC problem (the \(a_0\) quartc divergence remains). But it shows that the composition axiom eliminates the NEXT two layers of curvature sensitivity. The hierarchy: \(a_0\) (quartic, gravitational) > \(a_1\) (quadratic, ABSENT) > \(a_2\) (log in even \(d\), finite in odd \(d\), ABSENT on \(S^3\)).

**9.5.3 Uniqueness.** No other value of \(\xi\) gives both \(a_1 = 0\) and \(a_2 = 0\) on \(S^3\). \(a_1 = 0\) requires \(\xi = 1/6\) (universal). \(a_2 = 0\) on \(S^3\) at \(\xi = 1/6\) is then automatic (the (d-3) factor). But \(a_2(S^d) \neq 0\) for \(d \neq 3\) even at \(\xi = 1/6\). So the double vanishing is the intersection of composition (\(a_1 = 0\)) and dimension selection (\(d = 3\)).

### §9.6. The D=4 Coincidence Table (Updated)

| # | Coincidence | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| (i) | \((\partial\sigma)^2\) cancellation | Conformal class | HD-D1.3a |
| (ii) | \(\xi_{\mathrm{eff}} = \xi_{\mathrm{conf}} = 1/6\) | Universal | HD-D1.3b |
| (iv) | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) on \(S^{D-1}\) spectrally constant | Compact manifold | BB4/BB6 |
| **(v)** | **\(a_2(\Delta_{1/2}; S^3) = 0\)** | **Heat kernel** | **BB4 §10 / this section** |

(iii) (\(a_1 = 0\)) removed: universal, not D=4-specific (Thm M4.1).

(v) is independent of (i)-(iv): it uses the closed-form \(a_2\) formula, not conformal coupling, spectral shifts, or conformal class.

### §9.7. Open Questions

**OQ-dS-1.** Compute \(a_3(\Delta_{1/2}; S^3)\) — the first nonzero curvature coefficient. Does it have a clean form?

**OQ-dS-2.** The \((d-3)\) factor in \(a_2\): geometric origin? Is it related to the 3D Chern-Simons / topological nature of gravity in \(d=3\)?

**OQ-dS-3.** On the full Euclidean \(S^4\) (not spatial \(S^3\)): \(d=4\), \(a_2 \neq 0\). The conformal anomaly \(\propto a_2\) is nonzero. How does this interact with the spatial \(a_2 = 0\) in the Hamiltonian vs Lagrangian formulations?

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (physicist). Needs 2nd agent.**
