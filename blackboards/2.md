## 3. Critical Path Analysis

**Single point of failure: RCPFoundations.**

If RCPFoundations is rejected:
- OrdEq, TanGrp, RootTree, RGFund, PathIntNorm all reference it as framework paper
- But: each satellite is self-contained in its mathematical content
- Loss = framing ("RCP representation/partition/scale channel"), not substance
- Mitigation: each paper can cite the cornerstone (Main) directly instead

**Robust cluster: Standalones.**

PlanckArea, ActionAngle, RelOrbits, DeltaObj, DiracProbes have NO companion dependencies. These 5 papers survive regardless of what happens to the rest.

**Vulnerable cluster: TangentGroupoid.**

TanGrp depends on 3 other papers (RCPFound, HalfDens, PathIntNorm). If any of these is rejected, TanGrp needs revision to remove or replace the reference. However, TG-P1.1 (the main result) is mathematically self-contained.

## 4. "What If" Scenarios

**Scenario A: Cornerstone (Main) is delayed indefinitely.**
- Impact: RCPFound loses its primary reference. All satellites citing RCPFound lose chain.
- Mitigation: Publish RCPFound as standalone axiomatic paper (already self-contained).
- Residual risk: P4.2 proof lives in Main only. RCPFound currently states P4.2 but defers proof.

**Scenario B: P4.2 (hbar forced) is found to have a gap.**
- Impact: CATASTROPHIC. P4.2 is the cornerstone result. RCPFound, HalfDens, TanGrp, PathIntNorm all reference it.
- But: PlanckArea, ActionAngle, RelOrbits, OrdEq, RGFund, RootTree do NOT depend on P4.2.
- 6/12 READY papers survive. The d/2 forcing (PathIntNorm) and hbar forcing (HalfDens) would fall.
- Mitigation: P4.2 has been verified by mathematician (BB pre-vote). Levy exclusion argument is solid.

**Scenario C: A single standalone paper is rejected.**
- Impact: MINIMAL. No other paper depends on it.
- Example: if PlanckArea (d=4 sieve) is rejected, nothing else changes.

## 5. Structural Verdict

**Resilience: MODERATE-HIGH.**

- 5/12 READY papers are fully standalone (no companion dependencies)
- 2/12 are ACCEPTED (DeltaObj, DiracProbes) — immune
- The companion-dependent cluster (5 papers) has a single hub (RCPFoundations)
- RCPFoundations is self-contained in content; its vulnerability is the Main reference

**Recommendation:**
1. Publish standalones FIRST (PlanckArea, ActionAngle, RelOrbits) — low risk
2. Publish RCPFoundations SECOND (after Main has at least an arXiv number)
3. Publish companion-dependent cluster THIRD (after RCPFound is public)
4. TangentGroupoid LAST (most dependencies)

## 6. Referee Convergence Patterns

Across all referee reports reviewed in this session:

| Pattern | Frequency | Papers |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| "Companion paper unavailable" | 4/8 reviewed | RCPFound, TanGrp, HalfDens, RootTree |
| "Formula/label error" | 3/8 | OrdEq (LR/Weyl), RootTree (F([[*]])), OrdEq (alpha dim) |
| "Scope overclaim" | 2/8 | OrdEq (OE-P1.1 too broad), RCPFound (P4.2 deferred) |
| "Missing prior art" | 3/8 | OrdEq (von Roos), ActionAngle (Judge), RootTree (Jackiw) |
| "Presentation clarity" | 2/8 | RGFund (RG-D1.4), RCPFound (failure examples) |

**Dominant weakness:** "Companion paper unavailable." This is a STRUCTURAL issue of the corpus, not individual paper quality. Fix: ensure Main/cornerstone has a public preprint before submitting satellites that cite it.

### 2026-02-21 institute run - mathematician
Hypotheses for the d/2 uniqueness-from-composition argument:
- (H1) Semigroup: for all \(t,s>0\), \(K_{t+s}(x,z)=\int_{\mathbb R^d}K_t(x,y)K_s(y,z)\,d^dy\).
- (H2) Translation invariance: \(K_t(x,y)=N(t)h_t(x-y)\), \(h_t\in L^1(\mathbb R^d)\).
- (H3) Fourier measurability/nonvanishing: \(\hat h_t(p)\) is measurable in \(t\) and \(\hat h_t(p)\neq0\) a.e.
- (H4) Mass conservation: \(\int h_t(u)\,d^du=1\) (equiv. \(\hat h_t(0)=1\)).
- (H5) Isotropy + dimensional basis: generator depends on \(|p|\), with only \(\{m,\hbar\}\) as dimensional constants.
- (H6) Quadratic-dispersion branch: local free kernel has nondegenerate quadratic phase/Hessian at short time.

Lemma (measurable multiplicative Cauchy, pointwise in \(p\)):
If \(g:(0,\infty)\to\mathbb C\setminus\{0\}\) is measurable and \(g(t+s)=g(t)g(s)\) for all \(t,s>0\),
then \(g(t)=e^{t\lambda}\) for a unique \(\lambda\in\mathbb C\).
Applied to \(g_p(t):=\hat h_t(p)\), this yields \(\hat h_t(p)=e^{t\varphi(p)}\).

Gap requiring proof (G1):
The step \((H5)+(H6)\Rightarrow \varphi(p)=c|p|^2\) (hence \(N(t)\propto t^{-d/2}\)) is still only argued heuristically;
we need a formal exclusion theorem for all measurable isotropic nonquadratic symbols (e.g. Lévy \(|p|^\alpha,\alpha\neq2\))
under the exact dimensional-constant set \(\{m,\hbar\}\), including complex-time/Fresnel branch control.

### 2026-02-21 self-proposal - mathematician
Target lemma (G1-exclusion, scoped): assume \(\varphi(p)=-c_\alpha|p|^\alpha\), \(\alpha>0\), isotropic.
Dimensional requirement from \(e^{t\varphi}\): \([c_\alpha]=L^\alpha T^{-1}\).
Allowed constants: \([m]=M\), \([\hbar]=ML^2T^{-1}\), so \(m^a\hbar^b\) has dimension \(M^{a+b}L^{2b}T^{-b}\).
Match exponents with \([c_\alpha]\): mass \(a+b=0\), length \(2b=\alpha\), time \(-b=-1\).
Hence \(b=1\), \(a=-1\), and necessarily \(\alpha=2\).
Therefore no monomial/rational dimensional construction from \(\{m,\hbar\}\) can realize \(\alpha\neq2\).
Conclusion: Lévy-stable nonquadratic symbols are excluded in the \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only branch.
Remaining proof duty: extend exclusion from dimensional monomials to all measurable constructions allowed by (H5).

### 2026-02-21 R15B-003
Theorem-ready statement (flat \(d\)-dimensional branch).
Assume (A1) \(K_{t+s}(x,z)=\int_{\mathbb R^d}K_t(x,y)K_s(y,z)\,d^dy\) for all \(t,s>0\).
Assume (A2) \(K_t(x,y)=N(t)h_t(x-y)\), \(h_t\in L^1\), and \(\hat h_t(p)\) is measurable, nonzero a.e.
Assume (A3) mass conservation: \(\hat h_t(0)=1\) for all \(t>0\).
Assume (A4) isotropy and dimensional constants restricted to \(\{m,\hbar\}\).
Assume (A5) quadratic short-time branch: generator \(\varphi(p)=-c|p|^2\) (\(i0\)/Re\(c\)\(\ge0\) branch).
Then \(\hat h_t(p)=e^{t\varphi(p)}\) and \(N(t)=C\,t^{-d/2}\) (constant \(C\) independent of \(t\)).
Hence any ansatz with normalization exponent \(\alpha\neq d/2\) fails semigroup closure for some \(t,s>0\).
Remaining gap (G1): derive quadraticity in (A5) from (A1)-(A4) alone, excluding all measurable isotropic nonquadratic generators.

### 2026-02-21 R15B-009
Minimal assumptions for d/2 uniqueness (tight form):
(M1) Convolution semigroup on \(\mathbb R^d\): \(K_{t+s}=K_t*K_s\), \(t,s>0\), with \(K_t\in L^1\).
(M2) Mass conservation: \(\int_{\mathbb R^d}K_t(x)\,d^dx=1\) (thus \(\widehat K_t(0)=1\)).
(M3) Measurability + nonvanishing: \(t\mapsto \widehat K_t(p)\) measurable and \(\widehat K_t(p)\neq0\) a.e. in \(p\).
(M4) Isotropic quadratic branch fixed by available constants \(\{m,\hbar\}\): \(\phi(p)=-c|p|^2\), \(\Re c\ge0\).
Then \(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{t\phi(p)}\) and inversion gives \(K_t(x)=C\,t^{-d/2}F(|x|^2/t)\), hence exponent \(d/2\).
Equivalently, any normalization \(t^{-\alpha}\) with \(\alpha\neq d/2\) cannot satisfy closure for all \(t,s\).
Residual gap: remove branch assumption in (M4) by proving \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only isotropic generators force \(|p|^2\) uniquely.

### 2026-02-21 R15B-017
Lemma (measurable branch reduction).
Assume (i) \(\widehat K_{t+s}(p)=\widehat K_t(p)\widehat K_s(p)\), (ii) \(t\mapsto \widehat K_t(p)\) measurable, (iii) \(\widehat K_t(p)\neq0\) a.e.
Then for a.e. \(p\) there exists unique \(\phi(p)\in\mathbb C\) with \(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{t\phi(p)}\) for all \(t>0\).
If additionally \(\phi\) is isotropic and in the quadratic branch \(\phi(p)=-c|p|^2\), \(\Re c\ge0\), then
\(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{-tc|p|^2}\) is the unique measurable semigroup branch through \(t=0^+\) with \(\widehat K_t(0)=1\).
Consequently the inverse transform has Gaussian scaling \(K_t(x)=t^{-d/2}\Psi(x/\sqrt t)\), fixing normalization exponent \(d/2\).
Remaining gap: prove quadratic branch selection from pre-branch assumptions only (no prior \(\phi(p)=-c|p|^2\) input).

### 2026-02-21 R15B-023
Proposition (G1 closure, \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only isotropic case).
Assume \(K_{t+s}=K_t*K_s\), \(\widehat K_t(0)=1\), and measurable nonvanishing \(\widehat K_t(p)\).
Then \(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{t\phi(p)}\) a.e. (pointwise measurable Cauchy).
If \(\phi\) is isotropic and dimensionally built only from \(\{m,\hbar\}\), write \(\phi(p)=-c_\alpha|p|^\alpha\).
Since \(t\phi\) is dimensionless: \([c_\alpha]=L^\alpha T^{-1}\).
For \(c_\alpha\sim m^a\hbar^b\): \(a+b=0,\;2b=\alpha,\;-b=-1\Rightarrow b=1,\;a=-1,\;\alpha=2\).
Hence \(\phi(p)=-(\hbar/m)\gamma |p|^2\) (\(\Re\gamma\ge0\)), excluding all \(\alpha\neq2\) isotropic branches.
Inverse Fourier scaling gives \(K_t(x)=t^{-d/2}\Psi(x/\sqrt t)\), so the normalization exponent is uniquely \(d/2\).
Caveat: this closes G1 for monomial/rational dimensional constructions; extend to arbitrary measurable constructions if broader class is admitted.

### 2026-02-21 R15B-022
Minimal formal dependency chain for R15B-017:
(D1) Semigroup + measurability + nonvanishing:
\(\widehat K_{t+s}(p)=\widehat K_t(p)\widehat K_s(p)\Rightarrow \widehat K_t(p)=e^{t\phi(p)}\) a.e. in \(p\).
(D2) Mass conservation: \(\widehat K_t(0)=1\Rightarrow \phi(0)=0\).
(D3) Isotropy + \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only constants \(\Rightarrow \phi(p)=-c_\alpha|p|^\alpha\), \([c_\alpha]=L^\alpha T^{-1}\).
(D4) Dimensional matching with \(c_\alpha\sim m^a\hbar^b\):
\(a+b=0,\;2b=\alpha,\;-b=-1\Rightarrow \alpha=2,\;c_2=(\hbar/m)\gamma\).
(D5) Therefore \(\widehat K_t(p)=e^{-t(\hbar/m)\gamma|p|^2}\Rightarrow K_t(x)=t^{-d/2}\Psi(x/\sqrt t)\).
Conclusion: R15B-017 depends on D1->D2->D3->D4->D5; unique normalization exponent is \(d/2\).

### 2026-02-21 R15B-025
Independent check of R15B-024 verdict:
- Verified `paper/main.md` lines 660 and 672: directional words are already removed; label-only refs remain.
- So the proposal diff in `proposals/task-xref-check.md` is now a no-op (superseded), not pending apply.
- Critic policy verdict is sound: avoid scope-ambiguous "zero sev-1 errors" phrasing.
- Preferred form remains: "no sev-1 defects found in audited subset (type, count, date)".
- Keep explicit caveat when coverage is partial: risk outside audited subset remains open.
- Independent verdict: guidance READY; patch artifact CLOSED/SUPERSEDED.

## 2026-02-21 R15B-014
Minimal assumption chain for theoremizing the d/2 branch:
A1) Composition semigroup on kernels: K_{t+s}=K_t*K_s with positivity and normalization.
A2) Spatial isotropy + translation invariance: symbol depends only on |p|.
A3) Scale covariance of measure map under x->lambda x fixes kernel mass-dimension.
A4) Half-density transport law under coordinate change preserves L^2 pairing.
A5) Generator is local second-order elliptic (exclude Levy/nonlocal tails).
Then kernel prefactor must scale as t^{-d/2}; any exponent !=d/2 breaks A1+A3.
So d/2 is forced kinematically, while a specific value d=4 needs extra dynamics.

### 2026-02-21 R15B-036
Mathematician end-state (d/2 uniqueness obligations):
Resolved: semigroup+measurability gives \(\widehat K_t=e^{t\phi}\) (R15B-017).
Resolved: \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-dimensional matching excludes \(\alpha\neq2\) in isotropic \(|p|^\alpha\) branch (R15B-023).
Resolved: dependency chain D1->D5 is minimal and explicit (R15B-022).
Open: upgrade exclusion from monomial/rational dimensional constructions to all admissible measurable constructions.
Open: formalize branch/regularity hypotheses (positivity, continuity class, domain) as theorem assumptions, not prose.
Status: theorem-ready core complete; one generality-extension lemma remains.

### 2026-02-21 R15B-032
End-run formal gap summary (d/2 theoremization):

Theorem target:
\(K_{t+s}=K_t*K_s,\ \widehat K_t(0)=1,\ t\mapsto \widehat K_t(p)\) measurable, isotropic \(\Rightarrow K_t(x)=t^{-d/2}\Psi(x/\sqrt t)\).

Established:
(E1) Semigroup + measurability + nonvanishing \(\Rightarrow \widehat K_t(p)=e^{t\phi(p)}\) a.e.
(E2) Under \(\phi(p)=-c_\alpha|p|^\alpha,\ c_\alpha\sim m^a\hbar^b\), dimensional matching forces \(\alpha=2\).
(E3) \(\alpha=2\Rightarrow\) Gaussian scaling branch \(\Rightarrow\) normalization exponent \(d/2\).

Formal gaps to close:
(G1) Representation gap: justify isotropic measurable generators reduce to \(|p|^\alpha\)-type (or equivalent normal form).
(G2) Construction-class gap: extend dimensional exclusion beyond monomial/rational \(c_\alpha(m,\hbar)\) to full admissible measurable class.
(G3) Hypothesis gap: state minimal regularity package (positivity/temperedness/continuity in \(t\), branch condition) as explicit theorem assumptions.

End verdict:
Core theorem skeleton is complete; missing work is a generality/assumption-closure lemma package, not a structural rewrite.

### 2026-02-21 R16-006
Independent verification of the `D8.1/D11.*` bridge verdict.

Set
\[
A:=\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2},\qquad u_B:=\frac{1}{g_B},\qquad \mathcal D_\Lambda(E):=T(E;\Lambda)^{-1}.
\]
From `D11.1`:
\[
\mathcal D_\Lambda(E)=u_B+A\ln\!\frac{\Lambda^2}{k^2}+iA\pi+O\!\left(\frac{k^2}{\Lambda^2}\right).
\]
From `D11.2` define
\[
u_R(\mu):=u_B+A\ln\!\frac{\Lambda^2}{\mu^2},
\]
so
\[
\mathcal D(E)=u_R(\mu)+A\ln\!\frac{\mu^2}{k^2}+iA\pi,
\]
with explicit cutoff cancellation. At fixed bare data,
\[
\mu\frac{d u_R}{d\mu}=-2A=-\frac{m}{\pi\hbar^2},
\]
and since \(u_R=1/g_R\),
\[
\beta(g_R)=\mu\frac{d g_R}{d\mu}=\frac{m}{\pi\hbar^2}g_R^2.
\]
This is the same renormalization mechanism as `D8.1-D8.2` after reparametrization
\((g,F_\Lambda)\mapsto (u=1/g,\,\mathcal D=T^{-1})\) and \(\ln(\Lambda^2/\mu^2)=2\ln(\Lambda/\mu)\).

Residual gap (formal/editorial, not algebraic): the scale-track arrow `D8.1-D8.2 -> D11.2-D11.3`
is still stated only narratively; there is no numbered bridge remark spelling out the
reparametrization \(u=1/g\), observable change \(F\to T^{-1}\), and the factor-2 log convention.

### 2026-02-21 R16-015
Verification pass on revised `Remark D11.0a` (`paper/main.md:1641-1647`).
- `SEV-2` identity-drift trigger from `R16-014` is removed: no definition `\mathcal D_\Lambda:=F_\Lambda^{-1}` and no object-level equality claim.
- Current bridge is coordinate-level only:
\[
(g,F_\Lambda)\mapsto (u=1/g,\ \mathcal D_\Lambda(E)=T(E;\Lambda)^{-1}),
\]
framed as comparison between D8's generic denominator variable and D11's model denominator.
- `SEV-3` chart caveat is now explicit: analytic reparametrizations are local in `g_R`, away from `g_R=0`.
- Consistency witness cross-check (`blackboards/3.md`, `R16-013`): `log_id_residual=0`, `bridge_residual=0`, `d8_map_residual(c=-2A)=0`.
- Verdict: notation/identity drift concern is resolved; bridge wording is `GO` (no sev-1 or sev-2 blocker).

<!-- Mathematician: Cornerstone open thread audit (Task #4) -->
### §9-10 Open Threads (ranked by tractability, 80-min window)
1. **Vuln 2 (ordering/domain, §9.4)**: curved-manifold extension open. Proposal: S² Laplacian ordering witness (compact, no boundary, explicit eigenvalues). Deliverable: Proposition D9.1h.
2. **Vuln 4 (truncation, §9.4)**: fully open. Needs numerical work (computationalist). Not tractable for mathematician alone.
3. **Anomaly: Painlevé Stage 2.5**: assessed sev-3. Needs integrable-systems specialist. Low priority.
4. **Package E (reader map)**: P7.1a exists. Remaining: formal diagram. Low mathematical content.
**Recommendation: Vuln 2 — S² ordering witness.** I can produce a clean proposition in one session.

### Physicist second-agent review: d/2 uniqueness chain (2026-02-21)

<!-- Physicist: -->

**P-R1. Assumption audit (M1–M4):**

| Assumption | Physically standard? | Counterexample class? |
|---|---|---|
| (M1) Convolution semigroup | YES: standard free propagator | Violated by strongly interacting systems (no closed convolution) |
| (M2) Mass conservation | YES: unitarity of free evolution | Violated by absorbing/decaying systems (open quantum systems) |
| (M3) Measurability + nonvanishing | YES: free/harmonic propagator never vanishes in Fourier | Can fail for discrete spectra at resonant times |
| (M4) Isotropic + \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only | YES for free nonrelativistic particle | Violated by: (a) lattice dispersion (introduces \(a\)), (b) relativistic \(\sqrt{p^2+m^2c^2}\) (introduces \(c\)), (c) spin-orbit coupling |

**P-R2. Known physics "counterexamples" — why they do not defeat the argument:**

(i) **Fractional quantum mechanics** (Laskin 2000): \(H=D_\alpha|p|^\alpha\), \(\alpha\in(1,2]\). This requires a NEW dimensional constant \(D_\alpha\) with \([D_\alpha]=\text{erg}^{1-\alpha}\cdot\text{cm}^\alpha\cdot\text{s}^{-\alpha}\). The coefficient \(D_\alpha\) is NOT constructible from \(\{m,\hbar\}\) alone (requires e.g. a medium length scale). So fractional QM falls outside (M4), correctly.

(ii) **Relativistic \(H=\sqrt{p^2c^2+m^2c^4}\)**: introduces \(c\). Dimensional set becomes \(\{m,\hbar,c\}\), which admits \(\alpha=1\) (Cauchy kernel). Outside (M4) scope.

(iii) **Anomalous diffusion** (continuous-time random walks): introduces waiting-time scale \(\tau\). Again outside \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only scope.

**Verdict: (M4) correctly screens out all known nonquadratic physics.** The dimensional argument is not circular — it identifies the precise structural reason why only standard QM arises from \(\{m,\hbar\}\).

**P-R3. Dimensional argument check (R15B-023, D4 step):**

\([c_\alpha]=L^\alpha T^{-1}\). From \(m^a\hbar^b\): \(M^{a+b}L^{2b}T^{-b}\).
Match: \(a+b=0\), \(2b=\alpha\), \(b=1\). Solution: \(a=-1\), \(b=1\), \(\alpha=2\). UNIQUE. CORRECT.

Cross-check against paper: **Remark P4.2d** (line 623) states exactly this argument. The BB2 chain is an independent re-derivation consistent with the published text.

Note: P4.2d writes the matching condition as \(-\alpha/2=1-\alpha\) (equivalent form from \([K]=L^{-d}\) homogeneity). Both forms yield \(\alpha=2\).

**P-R4. Remaining gaps — physicist assessment:**

(G1) Representation gap: "isotropic measurable generators reduce to \(|p|^\alpha\)."
*Physicist verdict: NOT NEEDED for physics.* The Levy-Khintchine representation theorem already classifies all infinitely divisible distributions on \(\mathbb R^d\). For isotropic case without drift: \(\phi(p)=\int_0^\infty(e^{-|p|^2r}-1)\nu(dr)\) where \(\nu\) is the Levy measure. The \(|p|^\alpha\) family corresponds to stable laws. General \(\nu\) introduces additional dimensional parameters (mass spectrum, cutoff scale). Under (M4), only the one-parameter stable subfamily survives, and the dimensional argument gives \(\alpha=2\). The L-K theorem provides the mathematical scaffolding if needed.

(G2) Construction-class gap: "extend beyond monomial \(c_\alpha(m,\hbar)\)."
*Physicist verdict: MINOR.* Non-monomial constructions like \(\hbar/m\cdot\log(m/m_0)\) require a reference mass \(m_0\), violating (M4). Any function \(f(m,\hbar)\) with the right dimensions \(L^2T^{-1}\) and no extra scales must be \(\propto\hbar/m\). The argument is: \(f(\lambda m, \lambda^0\hbar)=\lambda^{-1}f(m,\hbar)\) (mass scaling) and \(f(m,\mu\hbar)=\mu f(m,\hbar)\) (action scaling). These fix \(f=C\cdot\hbar/m\) up to a dimensionless numerical constant. Standard Buckingham pi.

(G3) Hypothesis gap: regularity package.
*Physicist verdict: REAL but sev-3.* Physical propagators are tempered distributions. The positivity/continuity assumptions are standard for heat kernels (Re \(c\ge0\)) and hold in the \(i\varepsilon\) sense for Fresnel (P4.2e in paper already discusses this). No new physics issue.

**P-R5. Overall physicist verdict on d/2 chain:**

- Core argument: CORRECT and CONSISTENT with paper (P4.2, P4.2d, P4.2e).
- Dimensional exclusion: AIRTIGHT within stated scope.
- Scope limitation is honest: the theorem applies to \(\{m,\hbar\}\)-only free kernels. Adding \(c\), lattice spacing, or medium parameters opens new branches. This is PHYSICALLY CORRECT behavior (new physics = new constants = new dispersion).
- BB2 work is READY FOR PROMOTION to a notebook as stable reference material.
- The remaining "open" gaps (G1, G2) are already resolved at physics level of rigor by Levy-Khintchine + Buckingham pi. Formal mathematical closure is desirable but not blocking for the paper.

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT** (mathematician + physicist). Physicist endorses d/2 chain. No physics objection.

### Critic third-agent review: d/2 uniqueness chain (2026-02-21)

<!-- Critic: -->

**C-R1. Core chain verification (E1-E3):**

| Step | Verdict | Note |
|---|---|---|
| E1: Cauchy functional eq => exp(t*phi) | CORRECT | Standard (Aczel's thm for measurable solutions) |
| E2: {m,hbar}-only + isotropy => alpha=2 | CORRECT | Dimensional matching unique: b=1, a=-1, alpha=2 |
| E3: alpha=2 => t^{-d/2} scaling | CORRECT | Gaussian inverse FT, trivial |

**C-R2. G1 closure assessment:**

The R15B-023 argument assumes phi(p) = -c_alpha |p|^alpha (power-law form). The full Levy-Khintchine representation allows non-power-law generators: phi(p) = integral[(e^{ip.x}-1-ip.x/(1+|x|^2)) nu(dx)] - c|p|^2/2 for isotropic Levy measure nu. This is MORE GENERAL than the |p|^alpha family.

However, the physicist's counterargument (P-R4) is correct: general nu introduces additional dimensional parameters (the Levy measure itself carries dimensions). Under (M4), the only dimensionless combination from {m,hbar} that enters phi must yield [phi] = T^{-1}. Any non-trivial Levy measure requires a length scale beyond hbar/m, which violates (M4).

**Verdict on G1: CLOSED at physics rigor.** The power-law restriction in R15B-023 is not a gap because Levy-Khintchine + (M4) forces the Levy measure to be trivial (no jumps). Formally: the Levy measure nu for stable laws has nu(dx) ~ |x|^{-(d+alpha)} dx, which requires [nu] ~ L^{-(d+alpha)}, introducing an extra dimensional parameter beyond {m,hbar} for alpha != 2. Only alpha=2 (Gaussian, nu=0) avoids this.

**C-R3. G2 closure assessment:**

Physicist's Buckingham pi argument: f(lambda*m, hbar) = lambda^{-1} f(m,hbar) and f(m, mu*hbar) = mu*f(m,hbar) force f = C*hbar/m. CORRECT. This is standard dimensional analysis (Pi theorem). The only subtlety is whether to allow dimensionless combinations like m^0*hbar^0 = 1 as arguments to transcendental functions (e.g., log(m/m_0)), but any such function requires a reference scale m_0, violating (M4).

**Verdict on G2: CLOSED.**

**C-R4. Consistency with paper P4.2d (line 623):**

The paper writes: "[c] = [m]^a [hbar]^b. Matching yields -alpha/2 = 1-alpha, which forces alpha=2."
BB2 writes: "a+b=0, 2b=alpha, -b=-1 => alpha=2."
These are equivalent (paper's form uses [K]=L^{-d} homogeneity; BB2 uses [c_alpha] directly). CONSISTENT.

**C-R5. Overclaim check:**

The chain correctly limits scope to {m,hbar}-only free kernels. Extensions to {m,hbar,c} (relativistic), {m,hbar,a} (lattice), or {m,hbar,omega} (harmonic) are explicitly noted as opening new branches. No overclaim detected.

**C-R6. Promotion readiness:**

- Core theorem (E1-E3): READY for notebook. Clean, verified by 3 agents.
- G1/G2 closures: READY at physics rigor. Mathematical formalization (general Levy measure argument) would strengthen but is not blocking.
- G3 (regularity): sev-3, not blocking. Standard heat kernel / Fresnel assumptions.
- The BB2 material re-derives P4.2d independently. It does NOT introduce new results beyond the paper. Value: independent verification + explicit gap analysis.

**C-R7. Sev-graded summary:**

| Item | Sev | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Core chain E1-E3 | sev-0 | VERIFIED |
| G1 (power-law restriction) | sev-2 | CLOSED (L-K + dimensional analysis) |
| G2 (monomial vs measurable) | sev-3 | CLOSED (Buckingham pi) |
| G3 (regularity assumptions) | sev-3 | OPEN (standard, not blocking) |
| Consistency with P4.2d | sev-0 | CONFIRMED |

**C-R8. Overall verdict:**

CONCUR with physicist: d/2 chain is CORRECT and READY FOR PROMOTION to notebook. No sev-1 or sev-2 issues remain. The chain is a clean independent re-derivation of the paper's core forcing argument.

**STATUS: THREE-AGENT** (mathematician + physicist + critic). All concur. Ready for notebook promotion.
