# SR Orbit Precession for Inverse-Square Force
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S205

## Context
The relativistic orbits paper (papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md)
has the circular-orbit identity v = K/L and the bound L > K/c (Section 3),
plus the GR Schwarzschild baseline (Section 4). A natural addition is the
SR orbit equation showing precession — connecting the SR and GR results
and illustrating the "partial refinement" story.

## Derivation

### Starting point
From Section 2 of the paper, a particle of rest mass m under F = K/r²
has conserved angular momentum L = γmrv (tangential) and total
relativistic energy E = γmc² − K/r.

### Binet equation
Using the standard Binet substitution u = 1/r with φ as independent
variable, the SR orbit equation for an inverse-square force is:
$$
\frac{d^2u}{d\phi^2} + \omega^2 u = \frac{mK}{L^2}\omega^2,
$$
where
$$
\omega^2 := 1 - \frac{K^2}{c^2 L^2}.
$$

The condition L > K/c (Section 3's bound) ensures ω² > 0.

### Solution: precessing ellipse
The general solution is:
$$
u(\phi) = \frac{mK}{L^2} + A\cos(\omega\phi + \phi_0),
$$
i.e., a conic section in the variable ωφ. The orbit closes after
Δφ = 2π/ω, not 2π, so the apse line advances by:
$$
\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{prec}} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} - 2\pi
= 2\pi\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - K^2/(c^2L^2)}} - 1\right).
$$

### Weak-field expansion
For v ≪ c (i.e., K/(cL) ≪ 1):
$$
\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{prec}} \approx \frac{\pi K^2}{c^2 L^2}.
$$

### Gravitational case
For K = GMm, using the Keplerian relation L² = GMm²a(1−e²):
$$
\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{SR}} = \frac{\pi GM}{c^2 a(1-e^2)}.
$$

The GR (Schwarzschild) precession is:
$$
\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{GR}} = \frac{6\pi GM}{c^2 a(1-e^2)}.
$$

Therefore:
$$
\boxed{\;\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{SR}} = \frac{1}{6}\,\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{GR}}\;}.
$$

## Physical interpretation
SR captures exactly 1/6 of the full GR perihelion precession. The
remaining 5/6 comes from spacetime curvature (the −2ML²/r³ term in
the Schwarzschild effective potential, absent in the SR treatment).

This connects to the paper's refinement narrative:
- Newtonian mechanics: closed ellipses (no precession)
- SR refinement: precessing ellipses (1/6 of GR value)
- GR refinement: full precession from curved spacetime

Each step adds a correction that comes from taking the kinematic
constraints more seriously.

## SymPy verification
```python
from sympy import *
G, M, m, a, e, c = symbols('G M m a e c', positive=True)
K = G*M*m
L2 = G*M*m**2*a*(1-e**2)
delta_sr = pi * K**2 / (c**2 * L2)
delta_gr = 6*pi*G*M / (c**2 * a * (1-e**2))
simplify(delta_sr / delta_gr)  # => 1/6
```

## Proposed remark for relativistic orbits paper
Add as Remark 3.3 after Section 3.1. Title: "SR precession: the orbit
is a precessing ellipse." ~10 lines of prose + 2 displayed equations.
Connects forward to Section 4's GR baseline.
