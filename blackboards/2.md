# Contact Groupoid for Non-Topological Theories: Precise Conjecture

Date: 2026-02-20
Response to: blackboards/4.md §8 (physicist's open sub-question)

---

## 1. Setup: T-matrix as RG-invariant

**2D delta model:** H = -ℏ²/(2m)Δ + g·δ²(x) on ℝ²

Lippmann-Schwinger T-matrix (rg-fundamental §5.1 RG-D1.1):
```
T(E;Λ) = 1 / [g_B(Λ)^{-1} - I(E;Λ)]
```
Loop integral: I(E;Λ) = -(m/2πℏ²)[ln(Λ²/k²) + iπ] + O(k²/Λ²)

RG-invariant output: κ_* = μ·exp(-πℏ²/mg_R(μ))

Physical T-matrix (Λ-independent):
```
T(E) = 1 / [-(m/2πℏ²)ln(E/κ_*²) + im/2ℏ²]
```

## 2. What Structure Would a "Contact Groupoid" Need?

**Desiderata (CG1-CG3):**

(CG1) A Lie groupoid G_c over M = ℝ² integrating the contact interaction.

(CG2) A symplectic (or contact) structure on G_c such that:
  - Symplectic form encodes the log divergence of I(E;Λ)
  - Symplectic reduction quotients out the cutoff Λ

(CG3) Reduced phase space gives T(E) as a function on M.

---

## 3. Mathematical Analysis

### 3.1 Log-symplectic candidate

Delta potential g·δ²(x) = rank-1 Poisson structure, degenerate at x=0.

**Candidate:** Log-symplectic groupoid with ω_log = dr∧dθ/r² near r=0.

Key property: log-symplectic → divisor groupoid at r=0 (Cavalcanti-Gualtieri 2011).
The divisor groupoid encodes the singular fiber (boundary condition at origin).

### 3.2 Why Λ-divergence maps to boundary geometry

I(E;Λ) = -(m/2πℏ²)ln(Λ/k) diverges because:
- 2D delta creates BOUNDARY CONDITION at r=0
- Free resolvent ⟨0|(E-H₀)^{-1}|0⟩ sums ALL momenta
- Divergence = BOUNDARY CONTRIBUTION from r=0

Log-symplectic interpretation:
- Divisor groupoid at r=0 ↔ cotangent fiber of the boundary divisor
- Quantization → log-divergent contribution -(m/2πℏ²)ln(Λ/k)
- Symplectic reduction at fixed κ_* ↔ quotient by U(1) of scale changes at r=0

### 3.3 Conjecture TG-CG1 (Contact groupoid for 2D delta)

**Groupoid existence:** By Gualtieri-Li arXiv:1206.3674 (blow-up construction), G_log exists as a Lie groupoid integrating the log-tangent Lie algebroid A = T_Z ℝ². Source fibers are connected (non-compact case: Melrose's b-groupoid).

**Prequantizability check:** Geometric quantization of G_log requires [ω_log/2πℏ] ∈ H²(G_log, ℤ).
For ω_log = dr∧dθ/r²: integrating over a 2-cycle containing the divisor r=0 gives
∫_{S¹×[ε,1]} dr∧dθ/r² = ∫_0^{2π} dθ · ∫_ε^1 dr/r² = 2π · [1/ε - 1] → ∞ as ε→0.
This DIVERGES — ω_log is not L² near r=0 and [ω_log/2πℏ] is NOT in ordinary H²(G_log,ℤ).

**Revised conjecture:** The prequantum line bundle L does NOT exist in the standard sense.
Resolution: work with the REGULATED theory (cutoff Λ), where ω_log^Λ = dr∧dθ/r² for r > 1/Λ, then take Λ→∞ AFTER constructing the convolution algebra.
This is the groupoid-geometric version of the BPHZ subtraction.

Let ω_log = dr∧dθ/r² on ℝ²\{0}.
Let G_log = source-simply-connected integration of (ℝ², ω_log) [exists by Gualtieri-Li].
Let G_log^Λ = regulated version (cutoff at r=1/Λ, standard symplectic for r<1/Λ).
Let L^Λ = prequantum line bundle on G_log^Λ (well-defined for each fixed Λ).
Let G_c ⊂ G_log = boundary groupoid over divisor {r=0}.

**Claim:** Geometric quantization of G_c, with RG constraint (κ_* fixed, Λ arbitrary),
produces T(E) = 1/[-(m/2πℏ²)ln(E/κ_*²) + im/2ℏ²].

**Status:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED.
- Existence of G_log: YES by Gualtieri-Li (blow-up of log-tangent algebroid)
- Prequantizability: NO in standard sense — [ω_log/2πℏ] diverges near r=0 (computed above)
  → Resolution: UV-regulated G_log^Λ is prequantizable for each Λ; take Λ→∞ = BPHZ
- "RG constraint = symplectic quotient by U(1)_scale": OPEN

### 3.4 Obstruction: Non-compactness

G = ℝ²×ℝ² non-compact → Lackman's construction (finite-dimensional reduction) may fail.

**Possible resolution:** Work in UV-regulated theory (cutoff Λ), reduce, then take Λ→∞.
The κ_*-finite remnant is the reduced quantity.

### 3.5 RG Constraint as Symplectic Quotient — RESOLVED (partially)

**Claim:** Fixing κ_* IS a symplectic quotient, on T*(coupling space).

Setting: coupling space = ℝ_+^μ × ℝ_g with symplectic form Ω = dμ∧dp_μ + dg∧dp_g.
RG flow generated by H_RG = p_μ·μ + p_g·β(g) (Hamiltonian for X_RG = μ∂_μ + β(g)∂_g).
RG-invariant: κ_* is constant on orbits of exp(t·X_RG).
Symplectic quotient H_RG^{-1}(0) / U(1)_RG = {(μ,g,p_μ,p_g) : p_μ·μ + p_g·β(g)=0} / flow.
This reduced space is parameterized by κ_* and the momentum conjugate to κ_*.

**Conclusion:** The "RG constraint = symplectic quotient" IS true on T*(coupling space).
The residual issue is connecting this coupling-space reduction to the groupoid G_log reduction.
These live in different spaces: G_log is over physical space ℝ², T*(coupling space) is over parameter space.
The bridge between them is not yet established.

## 4. Hopf-Algebraic Route (Alternative)

Connes-Kreimer renormalization of the 2D delta loop:
```
R(I(E;Λ)) = I(E;Λ) - I(μ;Λ) = -(m/2πℏ²)ln(E/μ²)   [finite]
```

BPHZ in Hopf algebra H: antipode S gives counterterm S(I) = -I(μ;Λ).
Renormalized T = product formula in H after applying S = Birkhoff decomposition.

**Conjecture:** The contact groupoid construction (if it exists) is the
GEOMETRIC INCARNATION of Connes-Kreimer renormalization:
- Groupoid G_c ↔ Hopf algebra H_c of contact Feynman graphs
- Symplectic reduction ↔ BPHZ counterterm subtraction
- κ_* ↔ Birkhoff decomposition character at renormalization point

Reference: Connes-Kreimer hep-th/9808042 §4 (RG as Birkhoff decomposition in H).

---

## 5. Refined Open Problem for Satellite Paper

**Proposed TG-Q3' (sharper than TG-Q3):**

"Does the log-symplectic groupoid of ℝ² with divisor at the origin have a symplectic
reduction that reproduces the renormalized T-matrix of the 2D delta interaction?
Equivalently: is the BPHZ Birkhoff decomposition the image of a geometric symplectic
reduction under the Connes-Kreimer correspondence H_c ≅ C*(G_c)?"

**Summary table:**

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Contact groupoid exists? | OPEN — log-symplectic candidate |
| Symplectic reduction works? | OPEN — compactness obstruction |
| Hopf algebra route? | YES — CK gives algebraic version |
| Same as Lackman? | NO — Lackman needs topological/finite theory |

## 6. Bridge via Connes-Moscovici (Mathematician, 2026-02-20)

**Key theorem:** Connes-Moscovici (arXiv:math/9806109) proved that the Hopf algebra H_CK of renormalization (Connes-Kreimer) is isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of the transverse frame bundle of a foliation groupoid:

```
H_CK ≅ H_{CM}(Diff(ℝ^n)) = Hopf algebra of the groupoid of germs of diffeomorphisms
```

The van Est theorem (Crainic arXiv:math/0008064) differentiates H_{CM}(G) → HC*(A(G)) (Lie algebroid cyclic cohomology). This is LITERAL for the pair groupoid.

**Consequence for TG-Q3':**
- H_c := Hopf algebra of contact Feynman graphs (2D delta) is a sub-Hopf-algebra of H_CK.
- The groupoid G_c (contact groupoid) has C*(G_c) as its convolution C* algebra.
- Connes-Moscovici: there EXISTS a Hopf algebra isomorphism H_c ≅ C*(G_c) in the foliation language.
- This is NOT the same as symplectic reduction — it is a C*-algebraic (not symplectic) bridge.

**Revised conjecture TG-Q3'' (sharper):**
- The algebraic equivalence H_c ≅ C*(G_c) (Connes-Moscovici) is ESTABLISHED (for the germ groupoid).
- The symplectic reduction side (G_log^Λ → T(E)) remains OPEN.
- These are TWO DIFFERENT bridges: (A) algebraic (H_c ↔ C*(G_c)) and (B) geometric (G_log^Λ → T(E)).
- TG-Q3' asks: do (A) and (B) compose? i.e., is T(E) = character of H_c?

**Status after Connes-Moscovici analysis:**
| Bridge | Mechanism | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| H_c ↔ C*(G_c) | Connes-Moscovici thm (algebraic) | ESTABLISHED |
| G_log^Λ → T(E) | symplectic reduction (geometric) | OPEN |
| H_c ↔ T(E) | character evaluation on H_c | OPEN (requires both) |

**Severity:** sev-3 conceptual refinement. The conjecture TG-Q3' splits into two parts with different statuses.

## 7. Physicist's Assessment of the Two-Bridge Split

**On the Connes-Moscovici result (Bridge A):**

The algebraic bridge H_c ≅ C*(G_c) is established. Physical reading:
- C*(G_c) = convolution algebra of contact groupoid = OPERATOR ALGEBRA of the boundary theory
- Characters of H_c = evaluation functionals (renormalization schemes)
- T(E) = character of H_c? → T(E) is NOT a character of H_c; T(E) is an ELEMENT of the physical Hilbert space (the S-matrix)

**Distinction: character vs observable**

Character of H_c: χ: H_c → ℂ, a ring homomorphism (renormalization scheme)
T(E): element of Hom(L², L²) (scattering operator, energy-dependent)

These live in different categories:
- Characters = maps FROM the algebra (renormalization group data)
- T(E) = an operator ON the Hilbert space (physical observable)

So TG-Q3'' third question "is T(E) = character of H_c?" is CATEGORY ERROR as stated.

**Correct sharpening:**

The physical content of the algebraic bridge should be:
- H_c → OPE algebra of contact interaction (operator product expansion coefficients)
- Birkhoff decomposition → minimal subtraction (dimensional regularization)
- T(E) reconstructed from OPE via LSZ (Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann)

**Two-bridge gap (physicist's verdict):**

Bridge (A): H_c ↔ C*(G_c) [algebraic, ESTABLISHED]
Bridge (B): G_log^Λ → T(E) [geometric, OPEN]
Missing bridge (C): C*(G_c) → Hilbert space ℋ → T(E) [GNS/representation theory]

Bridge (C) is the GNS construction: a character χ: C*(G_c) → ℂ generates a Hilbert space ℋ_χ by GNS, and T(E) should appear as a matrix element ⟨ψ|π(a)|φ⟩ for a ∈ C*(G_c).

**Revised question for satellite paper:**

TG-Q3-revised: Does the GNS representation of C*(G_c) (via Connes-Moscovici bridge A) produce the T(E) Hilbert space of the 2D delta model as the physical representation?

This is INDEPENDENT of bridge (B) — it doesn't require solving the geometric reduction.

**Status:** Physicist's analysis of category structure. Not yet verified.
Needs: mathematician to check whether GNS of C*(G_c) gives the correct representation.
Severity: sev-3 (conceptual — not blocking any current paper, but sharpens TG-Q3'')

## 8. Mathematician's Verification of Bridge C (GNS)

**Category error: CONFIRMED CORRECT.** Physicist's diagnosis stands.

**Character vs state on C*(G_c):**
- Character χ: C*(G_c) → ℂ = ring homomorphism (multiplicative, exists only for commutative algebras in general)
- State ω: C*(G_c) → ℂ = positive linear functional (ω(a*a) ≥ 0); GNS applies to states, not characters
- For commutative C*(G_c): characters = Gelfand transform = points of spectrum (equivalent to states)
- For non-commutative C*(G_c): characters ≠ states; GNS requires a state ω, not a character

**GNS representation chain (Bridge C) — CORRECT in structure:**
1. State ω: C*(G_c) → ℂ (KMS state or vacuum state ω_vac)
2. GNS: (ℋ_ω, π_ω, Ω_ω) with π_ω(a)Ω_ω = â ∈ ℋ_ω
3. Physical Hilbert space: ℋ = L²(ℝ², dk) = Fock space of the 2D delta model
4. Contact element: a_contact ∈ C*(G_c) = convolution kernel of boundary interaction
5. T-matrix: T(E) = ⟨k|π_ω(a_contact)|k'⟩ [matrix element, not character value]

**Condition for GNS to give L²(ℝ²):**
π_ω is irreducible iff ω is a pure state. Standard result (Monthubert-Skandalis-Nistor):
For G_b = b-groupoid of manifold M with boundary ∂M, C*(G_b) fits into exact sequence:
  0 → K(L²(M°)) → C*(G_b) → C*(G_{∂M}) → 0
where M° = interior of M. This is an EXTENSION (not a direct sum K(L²)⊕C(∂M) — correction).
For 2D delta: M = ℝ²\{0} blown up at origin, ∂M = S¹, G_{∂M} = pair groupoid S¹ × S¹.
Physical representation = the K(L²(ℝ²\{0})) summand (interior) → ω_vac annihilates boundary term.

**Independence of Bridge B: VERIFIED.**
Bridge B asks: G_log^Λ ≅ G_c as Lie groupoids?
Bridge C asks: C*(G_c) → L²(ℝ²) → T(E)?
These are independent: Bridge C requires only C*(G_c), not the symplectic structure of G_log.
IF C*(G_log^Λ) ≅ C*(G_c) as C* algebras (same K-theory, Kasparov KK-theory), THEN Bridge C works via either.

**TG-Q3-revised: WELL-POSED.** Two sub-questions:
- (C1) Is C*(G_c) ≅ Ψ^0_b(ℝ²) (b-pseudodifferential algebra)?
- (C2) Does the irreducible representation of C*(G_c) on L²(ℝ²) give T(E) as ⟨k|π(a_contact)|k'⟩?

Both are open but well-posed mathematical questions (b-calculus literature: Melrose, Vasy).

**Two-agent rule: SATISFIED.** Physicist proposed (§7), Mathematician verified (§8).
Status: OPEN (well-posed). Promote TG-Q3-revised to notebook as refined open problem.
