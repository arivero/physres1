# Distributional Obstruction for kappa -> 0
Date: 2026-02-14
Cycle: S289 (parent: D31)

## Setup

Free-particle propagator, d dimensions:

  K_t(x,y) = (m / (2 pi i kappa t))^{d/2} exp(i m |x-y|^2 / (2 kappa t))

Distributional identity condition (I):

  lim_{t -> 0^+} integral K_t(x,y) phi(x) dx = phi(y),  for all phi in C_c^infty

General short-time kernel (with potential V):

  K_t(x,y) = (m / (2 pi i kappa t))^{d/2} sqrt(D_rel(x,y;t)) exp(i S_cl(x,y;t) / kappa)

where D_rel = Van Vleck determinant relative to free particle,
S_cl = classical action on the extremal path from y to x in time t.

## 1. Free-Particle kappa -> 0 (V = 0)

Set lambda = m/(2 kappa t), u = x - y. Pairing with test function:

  <K_t(.,y), phi> = (lambda / (i pi))^{d/2} integral exp(i lambda |u|^2) phi(u + y) du

Rescale v = sqrt(lambda) u:

  = (1/(i pi))^{d/2} integral exp(i |v|^2) phi(v/sqrt(lambda) + y) dv

As lambda -> infty (kappa -> 0, t fixed):

  phi(v/sqrt(lambda) + y) -> phi(y)

Limit:

  -> phi(y) * (1/(i pi))^{d/2} integral exp(i |v|^2) dv

Fresnel identity (d dimensions):

  integral exp(i |v|^2) dv = (i pi)^{d/2}

**Result:**

  lim_{kappa -> 0} <K_t(.,y), phi> = phi(y)    [free particle, any fixed t > 0]

**Conclusion:** For V = 0, the Fresnel nascent delta is exact. Limits commute.
The stationary point x = y has S_cl(y,y;t) = 0: no residual phase.

## 2. General Potential: Stationary Phase at kappa -> 0

For general V, set lambda = 1/kappa -> infty. Stationary phase of
integral exp(i S_cl(x,y;t)/kappa) phi(x) dx:

**Stationary point equation:**

  (d/dx) S_cl(x,y;t) = 0   <=>   p_f(x,y;t) = 0

where p_f = dS_cl/dq_f is the final momentum on the classical path from y to x.

**Definition:** Let x_0(y,t) = classical endpoint reached from y in time t with p_f = 0.

For the free particle: x_0(y,t) = y.
For V != 0 generically: x_0(y,t) != y when t > 0.

### Harmonic oscillator witness (d = 1)

  V = (1/2) m omega^2 q^2

  S_cl(x,y;t) = (m omega / (2 sin omega t)) [(x^2 + y^2) cos omega t - 2xy]

  p_f = dS_cl/dx = (m omega / sin omega t) [x cos omega t - y]

  p_f = 0  =>  x_0 = y / cos(omega t)

**Residual action at stationary point:**

  S_cl(x_0, y; t) = (m omega / (2 sin omega t)) [y^2/cos omega t + y^2 cos omega t - 2y^2/cos omega t]

  = (m omega y^2 / (2 sin omega t)) [(cos^2 omega t - 1) / cos omega t]

  = -m omega y^2 tan(omega t) / 2

**This is nonzero for y != 0, t > 0.**

## 3. Three Obstructions (General V != 0, t > 0)

### Obstruction 1: Support Shift

Stationary phase gives:

  lim_{kappa -> 0} <K_t(.,y), phi> ~ C(y,t) * phi(x_0(y,t)) * exp(i S_cl(x_0,y;t)/kappa)

The test function is evaluated at x_0(y,t) != y.

  delta(x - x_0(y,t)) != delta(x - y)   for t > 0

### Obstruction 2: Oscillatory Phase (Non-Convergence)

Residual phase factor:

  exp(i S_cl(x_0(y,t), y; t) / kappa)

oscillates without limit as kappa -> 0 whenever S_cl(x_0, y; t) != 0.

**The distributional limit does not exist:** for any y != 0 and t > 0,
the pairing <K_t(.,y), phi> has unbounded oscillations in kappa.

### Obstruction 3: Non-Commutativity of Limits

**Path A** (t -> 0 first):

  lim_{t -> 0} K_t(x,y) = delta(x - y)   [for any kappa > 0]

  Then lim_{kappa -> 0} delta(x - y) = delta(x - y).   [kappa-independent]

**Path B** (kappa -> 0 first):

  lim_{kappa -> 0} K_t(x,y) does not exist as a distribution (Obstruction 2).

  Even ignoring the phase: "limit" would be delta(x - x_0(y,t)) != delta(x - y).

**The limits do not commute.**

## 4. Dimensional Check

  [K_t] = length^{-d}  for all kappa > 0.    [correct]
  [delta(x - y)] = length^{-d}.               [correct]

No dimensional obstruction in normalization. The obstruction is
**kinematic** (support shift) and **oscillatory** (phase divergence),
not dimensional.

## 5. Why the Free Particle Is Special

For V = 0, the zero-momentum classical path from y stays at y:

  x_0(y,t) = y    (for all t)

and

  S_cl(y, y; t) = 0    (zero action on stationary path)

Both obstructions vanish identically. The Fresnel nascent delta
identity is exact, and lim_{kappa -> 0} K_t = delta(x - y) as distributions.

**The free particle is the unique case where kappa -> 0 preserves
the identity limit at fixed t > 0.** Any V != 0 breaks it.

## 6. Stationary Phase Prefactors (Completeness)

Full stationary phase evaluation (d dimensions):

  integral e^{(i/kappa) S_cl(x,y;t)} A(x) phi(x) dx

  ~ (2 pi kappa)^{d/2} / sqrt(|det S_cl''(x_0)|) * e^{i pi sigma/4}
    * A(x_0) phi(x_0) * e^{i S_cl(x_0,y;t)/kappa}

Combined with normalization (m/(2 pi i kappa t))^{d/2}:

  <K_t, phi> ~ (m/t)^{d/2} / (|det S_cl''(x_0)|)^{1/2} * sqrt(D_rel(x_0,y;t))
               * (phases) * phi(x_0) * e^{i S_cl(x_0,y;t)/kappa}

The kappa dependence cancels in the prefactor (correct dimensions),
but the oscillating exponential e^{i S_cl/kappa} remains uncancelled.

## 7. Verdict for P4.2(iii)

**Theorem (Distributional obstruction for kappa -> 0).**

Let L = T - V with V != 0, and let K_t^{(kappa)} be the corresponding propagator
family. Then:

(a) For any fixed t > 0, lim_{kappa -> 0} K_t^{(kappa)} does not exist in D'(R^d x R^d).

(b) Even formally (ignoring oscillatory divergence), the "limit" kernel
    concentrates on delta(x - x_0(y,t)) with x_0 != y: the classical-trajectory
    endpoint, not the diagonal.

(c) The identity limit lim_{t -> 0} K_t = delta(x - y) and the classical limit
    kappa -> 0 do not commute.

(d) The free particle (V = 0) is the unique exception where all obstructions
    vanish and the limits commute.

**Obstruction type:** Oscillatory divergence (primary) + support shift (secondary).
The support shift alone would give a wrong delta; the oscillatory divergence
prevents even that from converging.
