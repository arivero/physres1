## 2. Dependency Table

| Paper | Cites | Cited by | Critical dependency? |
|-------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| RCPFoundations | Main | OrdEq, TanGrp, RootTree, RGFund, PathIntNorm | HUB: if RCPFound falls, 5 papers lose framework |
| HalfDensityQFT | PathIntNorm | TanGrp | MODERATE: TanGrp uses HD kernel |
| TangentGroupoid | RCPFound, HalfDens, PathIntNorm | (none) | LEAF: depends on 3 papers |
| RGFundamental | RootTree, RCPFound | PathIntNorm | MODERATE: PathIntNorm cites RG beta example |
| PathIntNormalization | RGFund | HalfDens, TanGrp | HUB: d/2 result cited by 2 papers |
| OrderingEquivalence | RCPFound, RGFund | (none) | LEAF: depends on 2 |
| RootedTreeBookkeeping | Main | RGFund | MODERATE: RGFund cites worked example |
| PlanckArea | (none explicit) | (none) | STANDALONE: d=4 sieve self-contained |
| ActionAngle | (none explicit) | (none) | STANDALONE |
| RelOrbits | (none explicit) | (none) | STANDALONE |
| DeltaObjects | (none explicit) | (none) | STANDALONE: ACCEPTED |
| DiracProbes | (none explicit) | (none) | STANDALONE: ACCEPTED |

## 3. Critical Path Analysis

**Single point of failure: RCPFoundations.**

If RCPFoundations is rejected:
- OrdEq, TanGrp, RootTree, RGFund, PathIntNorm all reference it as framework paper
- But: each satellite is self-contained in its mathematical content
- Loss = framing ("RCP representation/partition/scale channel"), not substance
- Mitigation: each paper can cite the cornerstone (Main) directly instead

**Robust cluster: Standalones.**

PlanckArea, ActionAngle, RelOrbits, DeltaObj, DiracProbes have NO companion dependencies. These 5 papers survive regardless of what happens to the rest.

**Vulnerable cluster: TangentGroupoid.**

TanGrp depends on 3 other papers (RCPFound, HalfDens, PathIntNorm). If any of these is rejected, TanGrp needs revision to remove or replace the reference. However, TG-P1.1 (the main result) is mathematically self-contained.

## 4. "What If" Scenarios

**Scenario A: Cornerstone (Main) is delayed indefinitely.**
- Impact: RCPFound loses its primary reference. All satellites citing RCPFound lose chain.
- Mitigation: Publish RCPFound as standalone axiomatic paper (already self-contained).
- Residual risk: P4.2 proof lives in Main only. RCPFound currently states P4.2 but defers proof.

**Scenario B: P4.2 (hbar forced) is found to have a gap.**
- Impact: CATASTROPHIC. P4.2 is the cornerstone result. RCPFound, HalfDens, TanGrp, PathIntNorm all reference it.
- But: PlanckArea, ActionAngle, RelOrbits, OrdEq, RGFund, RootTree do NOT depend on P4.2.
- 6/12 READY papers survive. The d/2 forcing (PathIntNorm) and hbar forcing (HalfDens) would fall.
- Mitigation: P4.2 has been verified by mathematician (BB pre-vote). Levy exclusion argument is solid.

**Scenario C: A single standalone paper is rejected.**
- Impact: MINIMAL. No other paper depends on it.
- Example: if PlanckArea (d=4 sieve) is rejected, nothing else changes.

## 5. Structural Verdict

**Resilience: MODERATE-HIGH.**

- 5/12 READY papers are fully standalone (no companion dependencies)
- 2/12 are ACCEPTED (DeltaObj, DiracProbes) — immune
- The companion-dependent cluster (5 papers) has a single hub (RCPFoundations)
- RCPFoundations is self-contained in content; its vulnerability is the Main reference

**Recommendation:**
1. Publish standalones FIRST (PlanckArea, ActionAngle, RelOrbits) — low risk
2. Publish RCPFoundations SECOND (after Main has at least an arXiv number)
3. Publish companion-dependent cluster THIRD (after RCPFound is public)
4. TangentGroupoid LAST (most dependencies)

## 6. Referee Convergence Patterns

Across all referee reports reviewed in this session:

| Pattern | Frequency | Papers |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| "Companion paper unavailable" | 4/8 reviewed | RCPFound, TanGrp, HalfDens, RootTree |
| "Formula/label error" | 3/8 | OrdEq (LR/Weyl), RootTree (F([[*]])), OrdEq (alpha dim) |
| "Scope overclaim" | 2/8 | OrdEq (OE-P1.1 too broad), RCPFound (P4.2 deferred) |
| "Missing prior art" | 3/8 | OrdEq (von Roos), ActionAngle (Judge), RootTree (Jackiw) |
| "Presentation clarity" | 2/8 | RGFund (RG-D1.4), RCPFound (failure examples) |

**Dominant weakness:** "Companion paper unavailable." This is a STRUCTURAL issue of the corpus, not individual paper quality. Fix: ensure Main/cornerstone has a public preprint before submitting satellites that cite it.
