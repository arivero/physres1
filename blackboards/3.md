# Composition-Law Derivations of QM: Literature Landscape

## Three Families

### A. Dynamical Composition (propagators/amplitudes over time)

**A1. Our P4.2** — composition semigroup as single axiom
- K(c,t₃|a,t₁) = ∫ K(c,t₃|b,t₂) K(b,t₂|a,t₁) db
- (C) + physical setup → exp(iS/ℏ), d/2, Levy exclusion
- Tools: Levy-Khintchine, characteristic exponents
- Scope: QM + deformation quantization + RG (full RCP stack)

**A2. Luiz-de Oliveira ITA (arXiv:2602.09984, Feb 2026)** — NEW, CRITICAL
- Action density convolution: g(A;c,T₁+T₂|a) = ∫ db dA' g(A';b,T₁|a) g(A-A';c,T₂|b)
- Three axioms: action additivity + Cramer-Rao + normalization
- exp(iηA) from: |χ|=1 constraint (real exponentials diverge/decay)
- Levy-Khintchine → Gaussian (same mathematical mechanism as P4.2)
- Derives: d/2 exponent, Schrodinger eq, [x,p]=iℏ, E-L equations
- **HIGH OVERLAP with P4.2.** Same thesis, different proof technique.
- NO deformation quantization, NO RCP, NO RG channel
- Same group as earlier work already cited (ref P4.2i)

**A3. Caticha entropic dynamics (2009-2025)**
- QM as Hamilton-Killing flow on statistical manifold
- MaxEnt + information geometry → Schrodinger equation
- Not compositional per se; inference replaces dynamics
- Recent: QED extension (Entropy 2025)

### B. Kinematic Composition (systems/states)

**B1. Goyal-Knuth-Skilling 2010** (ref 24, ALREADY CITED)
- Sequential measurement composition → complex amplitudes + Born rule
- No dynamics, no path integral, no ℏ necessity

**B2. Chiribella-D'Ariano-Perinotti 2011**
- 6 axioms: causality, purity of composition, local discriminability, etc.
- Purification postulate central; monoidal category structure
- Finite-dim QM only; no ℏ derivation

**B3. Masanes-Mueller 2011**
- Tomographic locality + continuous reversibility
- Rules out real/quaternionic; selects complex QM
- Active 2025 debate: Kent critique vs Masanes-Galley-Mueller response (Quantum 9, 1592)

**B4. Dakic-Brukner 2009**
- 4 axioms: information capacity, subspace, local tomography, continuous reversibility

**B5. Hardy 2001** — 5 axioms + simplicity postulate

### C. Measure-Theoretic / Interference Hierarchy

**C1. Sorkin 1994** — quantum measure theory
- Grade-2 sum rule: μ(A∪B∪C) expanded; no 3rd-order interference
- Born rule = grade-2 additivity
- Experimentally: 3rd-order < 10⁻² of 2nd-order

**C2. Barnum-Mueller-Ududec 2014**
- No higher-order interference → R/C/H QM + octonionic d=3

## Assessment for P4.2

### What P4.2 does uniquely (no other program):
1. Single axiom: composition alone (others need 3-6)
2. Deformation quantization bridge (star product from composition)
3. RG as Stage 3 (composition → QM → QFT chain)
4. RCP taxonomy (partition/representation/scale)
5. d/2 from dimensional analysis (cleanest known)
6. "Refinement compatibility" — ZERO external hits (confirmed unique)

### What Luiz-de Oliveira ITA adds:
1. Cramer-Rao route to exp(iS/ℏ) — alternative proof, possibly more transparent
2. Lagrangian emergence from composition stationary phase
3. Information-geometric interpretation
4. **Published on arXiv first (Feb 2026)**

### Priority and citation obligations:
- arXiv:2602.09984 MUST be cited in cornerstone before submission
- Independent confirmation of P4.2's thesis strengthens our claim
- Differentiation is clear: we go further (deformation quant, RG, RCP)
- Framing: "Luiz-de Oliveira [ref] independently derive the quantum propagator from action additivity using information-theoretic methods; our approach recovers their result as a special case of the broader RCP framework."

### Family B programs: NOT competitors to P4.2
- They derive state-space structure (Hilbert space, complex numbers, Born rule)
- They do NOT derive dynamics (path integral, Schrodinger equation from composition)
- P4.2 is dynamical; B-family is kinematic
- Complementary, not competing. GKS (ref 24) correctly positioned as "kinematic complement"

## Action Item Status
- arXiv:2602.09984 ALREADY CITED as ref 23 (Remark P4.2i, line 641-642)
- Comparison in P4.2i verified accurate (critic Session 11)
- **NO FURTHER ACTION NEEDED** — prior art coverage complete

## §M1. Mathematician Second-Agent: Mathematical Comparison P4.2 vs Luiz-de Oliveira
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-21 -->

**M1.1 Common mathematical core:**
Both P4.2 and LdO use the SAME mathematical backbone:
1. Convolution semigroup structure (additive → multiplicative via Fourier/characteristic function)
2. Levy-Khintchine classification of infinitely divisible distributions
3. Physical regularity (continuity, locality) → Gaussian component dominates

**M1.2 Entry point comparison:**

| | P4.2 | LdO |
|---|---|---|
| Object | Kernel \(K(x,y;t)\) | Action density \(g(A;x,T|y)\) |
| Composition | \(\int K K' \, db\) (spatial) | \(\int g g' \, db\,dA'\) (spatial+action) |
| Fourier variable | momentum \(p\) | action parameter \(\eta\) |
| Key step | \(\hat{K}_t(p) = e^{t\psi(p)}\), L-K on \(\psi\) | \(\chi(\eta) = e^{i\eta A}\), \(|\chi|=1\) forces oscillatory |
| Regularity | (I) + (D) + L^2 unitarity | Cramer-Rao + normalization |
| Output | \(e^{c_0 S/\kappa}\), d/2 | \(e^{i\eta A}\), Schrodinger, [x,p]=iℏ |

**M1.3 Mathematical verdict:**
The two derivations are NOT mathematically equivalent — they are two distinct SPECIALIZATIONS of the same abstract theorem (Levy-Khintchine classification of continuous convolution semigroups on locally compact abelian groups).

- P4.2 specializes to the GROUP \((\mathbb{R}^d, +)\) (position space). Composition is convolution of kernels.
- LdO specializes to the GROUP \((\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}, +)\) (position × action space). Composition is joint convolution.
- LdO has an extra dimension (action \(A\)) which P4.2 does not carry as an explicit variable.
- P4.2 is more abstract (works with arbitrary characteristic exponents, not just Gaussian); LdO restricts early via Cramer-Rao.

**M1.4 What this means for citation:**
- CONCUR with critic: citation is MANDATORY (independent parallel derivation).
- Framing: both derive from the same mathematical theorem (L-K) but via different physical routes.
- P4.2 differentiation: (1) single axiom (vs 3 for LdO), (2) deformation quantization bridge, (3) RG/scale channel, (4) full RCP taxonomy.
- LdO differentiation: (1) Cramer-Rao information-theoretic motivation, (2) explicit Lagrangian emergence from stationary phase, (3) published first.

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT (critic + mathematician). CONCUR on citation obligation and differentiation.**

## §P1. Physicist Third-Agent: Physical Content Assessment
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-21 -->

**P1.1 Luiz-de Oliveira overlap (A2): CONCUR — HIGH OVERLAP, correctly assessed.**
The overlap is in the PHYSICAL THESIS (composition forces hbar), not just the mathematics. Both programs start from the same physical picture: a particle propagates between spacetime points, transition amplitudes compose by integration over intermediate configurations, and this composition structure alone forces quantum mechanics. The shared claim is that quantization is not a CHOICE but a CONSEQUENCE of composition. This is the paper's central message and LdO independently confirms it.

**P1.2 Physical mechanism comparison — a GENUINE difference:**
- P4.2 excludes non-Gaussian via *dimensional homogeneity* (D): the only Levy-stable process compatible with [K]=L^{-d} and dimensional constants {m, hbar} is Gaussian (alpha=2).
- LdO excludes via *Cramer-Rao*: finite information resolution forces bounded characters, hence exp(iA/eta), and then the L-K Gaussian dominance follows.
- Physically: P4.2 says "dimension counting kills Levy flights." LdO says "finite measurement resolution kills them."
- Both valid but operationally distinct. P4.2 is more parsimonious (uses only physical dimensions); LdO adds information-theoretic content (observer resolution).

**P1.3 exp(iS/hbar) derivation — key physical distinction:**
In P4.2, the exponential form is a THEOREM of composition (Remark P4.2c: Cauchy functional equation forces log-linearity). In LdO, it follows from |chi|=1 (bounded character) + Cramer-Rao. P4.2's route is more direct: the additive->multiplicative homomorphism is uniquely exponential under continuity. LdO's route is more physically motivated: finite observational resolution forces the oscillatory form. Both are correct.

**P1.4 Family B assessment: CONCUR — kinematic vs dynamical is the right distinction.**
GKS (B1) derives complex amplitudes and Born rule — this is the ALGEBRAIC structure of QM. Chiribella+ (B2) derives the categorical structure. Neither derives hbar, the path integral, or the Schrodinger equation. P4.2 and LdO are DYNAMICAL reconstructions; B-family are ALGEBRAIC/KINEMATIC. The distinction is clean.

**P1.5 Missing from landscape (sev-4):**
The landscape omits one relevant program:
- **Nelson stochastic mechanics (1966/1985)**: derives Schrodinger from diffusion + osmotic velocity. Not compositional per se (Markovian, not semigroup-focused), but the mathematical structure (Wiener measure, Feynman-Kac formula) overlaps with the Gaussian kernel forced by P4.2. Nelson's diffusion constant is D=hbar/(2m), which is EXACTLY the composition-forced normalization (m/2pi hbar t)^{d/2} read as a diffusion kernel. This is mentioned in passing in the paper (via Oksendal reference) but not in this landscape.
- Not a competitor (Nelson does NOT derive hbar from composition), but historically relevant as the Euclidean shadow of the composition program.
- **Verdict**: sev-4 gap, no action needed. The landscape covers the genuinely compositional programs.

**P1.6 Citation framing (P4.2i): VERIFIED CORRECT.**
Read paper line 641-642. The framing is accurate, generous to LdO, and correctly notes the complementarity. The sentence "the convergence of two independent lines of argument strengthens the case that composition is the operative principle" is the right tone — not defensive, not dismissive.

**P1.7 Sorkin (C1): physically important note.**
Sorkin's grade-2 sum rule is the measure-theoretic VERSION of what P4.2 derives dynamically. Born rule = grade-2 additivity of the quantum measure. The composition law K*K = K forces exactly this grade-2 structure (bilinear in K, integrated over one intermediate point = one "interference" variable). Grade-3 would require K*K*K with TWO intermediate integrations, which is NOT what composition gives (composition only inserts ONE intermediate point at a time). So composition IMPLIES Sorkin's grade-2 constraint. This connection is not noted in the landscape.

**P1.8 Overall assessment:**
- The landscape is comprehensive and correctly structured
- The three-family taxonomy (dynamical/kinematic/measure-theoretic) is physically sound
- The differentiation of P4.2 from all competitors is accurate
- The citation obligation is met (LdO already cited as ref 23)
- Two sev-4 observations (P1.5 Nelson, P1.7 Sorkin-composition connection) — interesting but no action needed

**Verdict: APPROVE. Landscape is accurate, citation is handled, differentiation is correct.**

**STATUS: THREE-AGENT (critic + mathematician + physicist). UNANIMOUS APPROVE.**
