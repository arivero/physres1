# Husimi Function: Visualizing Action-Angle States
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S128

## Context
The action-angle paper (Example 6.1, line 96) says "their phase-space (Husimi)
distribution is a ring centered at the origin" for Fock states, but doesn't define
the Husimi function or show the formula. A brief remark making this quantitative
would make the paper more self-contained.

## Key claims

1. **Husimi definition.** The Husimi Q-function is Q(α) = ⟨α|ρ̂|α⟩/π, where
   |α⟩ are the coherent states. It is non-negative (unlike the Wigner function)
   and provides a phase-space quasiprobability distribution.

2. **Fock state Husimi.** For |n⟩:
   Q(α) = e^{-|α|²} |α|^{2n} / (πn!)

   Derivation: ⟨α|n⟩ = e^{-|α|²/2} α^n/√(n!), so |⟨α|n⟩|² = e^{-|α|²} |α|^{2n}/n!.
   In polar coords α = re^{iθ}: Q = e^{-r²} r^{2n}/(πn!), independent of θ.
   Radial maximum at r² = n, so the ring is at |α| = √n = √(J/ℏ - 1/2) ≈ √(J/ℏ).
   Uniform in θ: angle is completely delocalized. ✓

3. **Coherent state Husimi.** For |α₀⟩:
   Q(α) = e^{-|α-α₀|²}/π

   Derivation: ⟨α|β⟩ = exp(-|α|²/2 - |β|²/2 + α*β), so
   |⟨α|α₀⟩|² = exp(-|α-α₀|²). Gaussian blob centered at α₀. ✓
   Both action (radial distance) and angle (phase of α₀) localized.

4. **Diagnostic value.** The Husimi function provides a clean visual test for the
   action-angle tradeoff:
   - Fock state: ring (sharp action, delocalized angle)
   - Coherent state: blob (localized both, with uncertainty-limited width)
   - Narrow Fock superposition (e.g., |n⟩ + |n+1⟩): thin ring (sharp radial localization,
     delocalized angle)
   - Angular coherent superposition (e.g., |α₀⟩ + |α₀e^{iθ}⟩): arc or multi-blob pattern
     (localized radius, partial angle localization)

   The ring ↔ blob distinction is the phase-space manifestation of the paper's
   Fourier tradeoff (Section 4).

   Note: Standard squeezed states (squeezed vacuum, squeezed coherent) show elliptical
   Gaussian blobs, not rings or arcs. The "action-angle squeezed" states described here
   are superposition states, not the quadrature-squeezed states of typical lab terminology.

5. **Why Husimi (not Wigner).** The Wigner function W(q,p) can be negative for
   non-classical states (including Fock states with n ≥ 1). The Husimi function
   is always non-negative because it's a diagonal matrix element. For the purpose
   of "visualizing" the action-angle tradeoff, Husimi is the right tool because
   the "ring" picture is literal (non-negative probability on phase space).

## Proposed remark for action-angle satellite
Remark 6.4 (~3 lines) after Remark 6.3 or after Example 6.1. Define Q(α),
give the Fock and coherent formulas, note ring vs blob as phase-space diagnostic
of the action-angle tradeoff.

## Reviewer feedback (quantum optics experimentalist)
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Persona:** Daily work with coherent states, squeezed states, Husimi/Wigner tomography

**Claim-by-claim verdict:**

1. **Husimi definition**: **CORRECT**. Standard normalization Q(α) = ⟨α|ρ̂|α⟩/π. Non-negativity is a key practical advantage for visualization and reconstruction from homodyne data.

2. **Fock state Husimi**: **CORRECT**. Formula Q(α) = e^{-|α|²}|α|^{2n}/(πn!) is standard. Ring radius r = √n follows from maximizing the radial distribution. Connection to action J = ℏ(n + 1/2) is accurate. We measure these rings routinely in photon number state tomography.

3. **Coherent state Husimi**: **CORRECT**. The Gaussian blob Q(α) = e^{-|α-α₀|²}/π is textbook. This is what we see when characterizing laser outputs or measuring oscillator displacement.

4. **Diagnostic value**: **CORRECT WITH CAVEATS (fixed above)**. Original claim misused "number-squeezed" and "phase-squeezed" terminology. Standard squeezed states (lab terminology) produce elliptical Gaussian Husimi functions, not rings or arcs. The ring/arc patterns arise from Fock superpositions or angular coherent superpositions. Fixed the terminology to avoid confusion with quadrature squeezing, which is a different physical regime.

5. **Why Husimi (not Wigner)**: **CORRECT**. Wigner negativity for Fock states (n ≥ 1) is well-established—we see this when reconstructing number states from homodyne quadrature data. Husimi is non-negative by construction (convolution of Wigner with Gaussian, or equivalently, projection onto coherent states). Better for intuitive "phase-space probability" visualization, though Wigner contains more information (detects non-classicality via negativity).

**Overall assessment:** Solid blackboard note. The physics is correct, formulas match experimental reality. Main issue was mixing up quadrature-squeezed states (standard lab terminology) with action-angle superposition states (which would be exotic and hard to prepare). Fixed this in claim 4. The proposed remark for the paper would be helpful—many theory papers underestimate how useful an explicit Husimi formula is for experimentalists trying to visualize the state space.
