# Why D=10,11,26 Don't Bark: Special Dimensions and the Half-Density Framework
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S214

## The "Curious Incident" Observation

The half-density / RCP framework identifies d=2,3,4 as structurally special dimensions
via the exponent d/2. But the famous string-theoretic dimensions D=6,10,11,26 are
completely absent. Why?

## Two Layers of "Special Dimension"

**Layer 1 (the d/2 layer — our framework):**
Given a d-dimensional manifold, what is the canonical scaling of kernels?
- Identity kernel: ε^{-d/2}
- Heat kernel convergence: d < 2
- Sobolev embedding H^k → C^0: k > d/2
- Point interactions without renormalization: d ≤ 3
- Gravity-only monomial sieve (PA-H2.5): selects d = 4

These are properties of the **target space** treated as a manifold with a Laplacian.
Thresholds are inherently **low-dimensional** (d=2,3,4) because short-distance
singularities become uncontrollable quickly as d grows.

**Layer 2 (the field-content layer — string theory):**
Given fields on a d-dimensional manifold, which field content is self-consistent?
- Anomaly cancellation → D=10
- Supersymmetry algebra (32 supercharges max) → D=11
- Worldsheet conformal invariance (central charge) → D=26
- (2,0) superconformal → D=6

These involve constraints **beyond** measure theory — they require field content,
symmetry representations, spin-statistics.

## The Monomial Sieve Obstruction

For d=10: d/2 = 5. Gravity-only sieve gives k = 10/(2·8) = 5/8 — not integer.
With gravity + α': need 8n + 2m = 5 — parity obstruction (even = odd).

For d=26: d/2 = 13. Gravity-only gives k = 26/48 = 13/24 — not integer.
With Λ: 24n - 2m = 13 — same parity obstruction.

For d=11: d/2 = 11/2 — half-integer, unreachable by integer-dimensional couplings.

For d=6: d/2 = 3. Gravity-only gives k = 6/8 = 3/4 — not integer.
But d=6 appears in the YM sieve (PA example E3) with p=3.

**Punchline:** all these dimensions have parity-like obstructions in the integrality
sieve. The d/2 exponent produces thresholds that are inherently low-dimensional.

## The Potential Bridge (Undeveloped)

A worldsheet is a 2D manifold where d/2 = 1 and the framework identifies
transmutation as the canonical scale-generating mechanism. With D scalar fields
on the worldsheet, the anomaly-cancellation arithmetic yields D=26.

Question: does the half-density d/2 exponent on the *worldsheet*, combined with
field-content counting (D fields), reproduce the central-charge condition?
This would connect the two layers but requires incorporating field-content
counting into the framework — currently outside scope.

## Assessment

The absence is:
1. **Expected and informative** — not a gap but a feature
2. **Consistent with the project's guardrails** (research-state.md §3: keep
   half-density filters distinct from SUSY/division-algebra/holonomy filters)
3. **A structural clarification** of what the framework does and does not address:
   it provides the *stage* (canonical measure, kernel composition) on which the
   field-content *drama* plays out

## Existing Coverage

Already noted in the Planck-area paper:
- PA-H2.6: "Special dimensions do not come from half-densities alone"
- PA line 184: "division algebras, special holonomy, supersymmetry... those filters
  are separate from the half-density story and should not be conflated"
- research-state.md guardrail #3: "keep half-density/normalization distinct from
  other dimension-selection filters (SUSY/division algebras/hopf bundles)"
