# A4 Scale Channel vs Borel Singularity Positions: Resurgence Q2

## 1. The Question

**A1 (partition channel):** K_{t₁+t₂} = ∫K_{t₁}K_{t₂}
→ Forces Borel singularity structure: ζ = nA (§15), bion log coefficient (§16)

**A4 (scale channel):** R_{μ₂} = R_{μ₁→μ₂} ∘ R_{μ₁}  (RG semigroup)
→ Forces β(g) to exist (RG-P1.2, D6.4b in paper)

**Q2:** Do A1+A4 together constrain the VALUE of A (the instanton action), or
only the EXISTENCE and STRUCTURE of Borel singularities at integer multiples of A?

## 2. Setup: Borel Plane under Scaling

**Borel transform pair:**
K_t(ζ) = ∫₀^∞ dζ B(ζ) e^{-ζ/ℏ}  [formal, for Borel-summable series]
A1 forces: B(ζ) has poles at ζ = nA = n·S_inst/ℏ (for integer n≥1).

**Under the RG scaling μ → μ' (A4):**
g → g'(μ) via the RG flow: dg/d(log μ) = β(g)
S_inst(g) → S_inst(g'(μ))  [instanton action depends on coupling]

**Key question:** Does the A4 composition R_{μ₂} = R_{μ₁→μ₂} ∘ R_{μ₁} constrain
the function S_inst(g), or only the existence of β(g)?

## 3. A4 Acts on the Coupling, Not on ζ Directly

**Structure of A4:**
The scale channel axiom says the RG kernel K^{(scale)}_μ satisfies a composition law
in the scale parameter μ. The RG flow sends: coupling g ↦ g(μ) via β.

The Borel singularity position A = S_inst/ℏ depends on g:
- For SU(N) Yang-Mills: A = 8π²/g² (one-instanton action, 't Hooft 1976)
- For double-well QM: A = 4/3λ (quartic coupling)
- Under RG: g runs → A = A(μ) = S_inst(g(μ))/ℏ runs with μ

**Claim (Q2a — new):**
A4 forces the Borel singularity POSITION A(μ) to satisfy a differential equation:
    dA/d(log μ) = -(∂ log S_inst/∂ log g) · β(g(μ))

This is NOT a composition constraint on A directly — it follows from the chain rule
applied to A(μ) = S_inst(g(μ))/ℏ. A4 forces β(g) to exist; the chain rule then forces A(μ) to run.

**Conclusion (Q2a):** A4 does NOT constrain the value A₀ = A(μ₀) at any reference scale.
A₀ is a dynamical input (the instanton action at the UV scale). A4 forces the running of A,
not its initial value.

## 4. What A1+A4 Force Together

**A1 alone forces (from RES §15-16):**
- Borel singularities at ζ = nA (for fixed A)
- Non-resonant factorization: C_{n,m} = C_1^n · C_2^m
- Bion log coefficient = [S₁]²/A (forced by convolution)
- Structure of the trans-series (sectors at nA)

**A4 alone forces (from D6.4b/RG-P1.2):**
- β(g) exists: the scale-channel semigroup forces a first-order ODE for g(μ)
- β is NOT determined (its form is dynamical content)

**A1+A4 together force:**

**(F1) Consistency condition on the Borel structure under RG:**
The Borel singularity at ζ = A(μ) must remain a singularity for ALL μ along the RG flow.
This forces: if A(μ) crosses another singularity position (e.g., A(μ) = A₂/2 for some μ),
the resurgence triangle must be consistent (no cancellation that breaks A1-composition).

**(F2) Running of resurgence data:**
The Stokes constants S_n(t, μ) at ζ = nA(μ) must also satisfy composition under A4:
    S_n(t, μ₂) = RG-evolved version of S_n(t, μ₁)
This gives a "resurgence RG" — the running of Stokes constants under scale change.

**(F3) No new forcing of A₀:**
The absolute position A₀ is NOT forced. Only the FLOW A(μ) = A(g(μ)) is constrained.

## 5. New Observation: Stokes Constant RG (Mathematician, new)

**Setting:** Consider a theory with:
- A1: K_t^{(μ)} = Σ_{n≥0} a_n(μ) ℏ^n + e^{-A(μ)/ℏ} Σ_{n≥0} b_n(μ) ℏ^n + ...
- A4: a_n(μ), b_n(μ), A(μ) all run with μ via some Callan-Symanzik equations

**Composition in A1 forces (RES §15-16):** for fixed μ, the structure of the trans-series.
**Composition in A4 forces:** Callan-Symanzik equations for each coefficient a_n, b_n.

**New result:**
For the instanton sector coefficient b_n(μ):
The A4 composition gives: μ ∂b_n/∂μ = -β(g) ∂b_n/∂g + [anomalous dimension] · b_n

This is just the standard Callan-Symanzik equation for the instanton sector coefficients.
**A4 forces the Callan-Symanzik equation for the Stokes constants. This is the "resurgence RG."**

**Novelty:** The standard RG literature (Zinn-Justin, Dunne-Ünsal) derives Callan-Symanzik
equations for perturbative coefficients. The extension to Stokes constants is straightforward
but not standard. A4 forces it as a consequence of scale-channel composition.

**Explicit form for A(μ):**
    μ dA/dμ = -β(g) · dA/dg = -β(g) · (1/ℏ) · dS_inst/dg

For SU(N) YM: S_inst = 8π²/g² → dS_inst/dg = -16π²/g³
    μ dA/dμ = (16π²β(g))/(g³ℏ)

With β(g) = -b₀g³/(16π²) + ... (one-loop):
    μ dA/dμ ≈ -b₀/ℏ + O(g²)

→ A(μ) decreases as μ increases (for b₀ > 0, asymptotically free theory).
This is JUST the running of the instanton action — known physics, not a new constraint.

## 6. Negative Result: A₀ is Not Forced

**Claim (Q2b — negative, new):**
The value A₀ = S_inst(g_UV)/ℏ at the UV reference scale μ_UV is NOT constrained by
either A1 or A4. It requires a dynamical input: the UV value of the coupling g_UV.

**Argument:**
- A1 forces the STRUCTURE of singularities (at integer multiples of A, with forced bion coefficients).
- A4 forces the RUNNING of A (via β-function and chain rule).
- Neither constrains the initial value A₀ = S_inst(g_UV)/ℏ.
- Physically: A₀ depends on the gauge coupling at the UV scale — a physical input not derivable from composition axioms.

**Analogy with P4.2:**
P4.2 forces κ=ℏ (the value of the quantization constant) from (C)+(D)+(I).
BUT: P4.2 does NOT force the value of the action S — that is dynamical content.
Similarly: A1+A4 force the structure and running of Borel singularities, but NOT the instanton action value.

## 7. A New Constraint: Resonance Rigidity Under A4

**Observation (Q2c — positive, new):**
If the Borel singularity structure under A1 has a RESONANCE (A₁ = n·A₂ for some integers n,
meaning a "bion-type" singularity coincides with an integer multiple of a fundamental singularity),
then A4 must preserve this resonance under RG flow:
    A₁(μ) = n·A₂(μ) for ALL μ (if true at μ₀)

This forces: β(g) satisfies a relation:
    (1/A₁) dA₁/d(log μ) = (1/A₂) dA₂/d(log μ)

i.e., the logarithmic running rates of the two instanton actions are EQUAL.

**When does this happen?**
In theories where A₁ and A₂ are both proportional to 1/g²:
- A₁ = k₁/g², A₂ = k₂/g² → A₁/A₂ = k₁/k₂ = constant. Resonance preserved. ✓
In theories where A₁ and A₂ have different coupling dependences:
- Resonance A₁ = n·A₂ at μ₀ will generically NOT be preserved at μ' ≠ μ₀.

**This is a CONSTRAINT from A4:** If a theory has a resonance in its Borel structure that is
required for consistency (e.g., forced by A1), then A4 forces the β-functions of the relevant
couplings to satisfy a compatibility condition.

**Explicit case (SU(N) × SU(N) gauge theory):**
If A₁ = 8π²/g₁², A₂ = 8π²/g₂² and A₁ = A₂ is forced by some symmetry,
then A4 forces β(g₁) = β(g₂) (same RG running for both gauge groups).

## 8. Summary and Connection to Project

**Q2 Answer (three-part):**
- Q2a: A4 forces the RUNNING of Borel singularity positions A(μ) via the chain rule + β(g). Does NOT force A₀.
- Q2b: A₀ = S_inst(g_UV)/ℏ is dynamical content (not forced by any combination of A1-A4).
- Q2c: If A1 forces a resonance (A₁ = nA₂), then A4 forces the β-functions of the respective couplings to have equal logarithmic running rates. This IS a new A1+A4 joint constraint.

**Connection to project:**
- D6.4b (paper): "scale channel forces β to exist" ← A4 alone
- RES §15-16 (notebook): "A1 forces instanton structure" ← A1 alone
- NEW HERE (Q2c): "resonance preservation forces β-function compatibility" ← A1+A4 joint

**Strength:** Q2c is sev-2. It is a genuine new constraint (A1+A4 jointly imply something
that neither implies alone), but it only applies when a resonance is present.

**Proposed notebook entry:** Append Q2a-Q2c to notebooks/resurgence-composition-bridge.md as §17.
No paper-edit needed (Q2a/b are confirmation; Q2c is a narrow new result, below paper threshold).
