# OQ1a: Composition → Curvature Coupling → What?

## §1. The Chain

```
P4.2 (composition) → half-density measure → V_HD = -|g|^{1/4} Δ(|g|^{-1/4})
```

At RNC center: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) for ANY \((M,g)\) (BB0 §13).

On Lie groups: constancy (Prop M0.1) → \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) **everywhere** (Thm M0.3).

On constant-curvature: \(V_{\mathrm{HD,const}} = -(d-1)R/(4d)\) (Remark D9.1l). Equals \(-R/6\) iff \(d = 3\).

## §2. What Composition Forces

1. The EXISTENCE of curvature coupling (V_HD ≠ 0 when R ≠ 0)
2. The FORM of curvature coupling (ξ_eff = 1/6 at leading order, universally)
3. The VALUE of V_HD on specific manifolds (determined by geometry, no free parameters)

## §3. What Composition Does NOT Force

1. The metric \(g\) itself (external input; no Einstein equations derived)
2. The value of R (depends on the chosen manifold)
3. Gravity's existence (composition works on flat space with V_HD = 0)

## §4. Three Levels of V_HD = -R/6

| Level | Statement | Scope | Source |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Local | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) in RNC at \(p\) | Any \((M,g)\), point \(p\) | Standard |
| Semi-global | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) in normal-coordinate patch | Weak curvature, small patch | Expansion |
| **Global** | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) **everywhere** | Lie groups, products of \(S^1\) and \(S^3\) | Thm M0.3 + C5.1 |

The jump from local to global is non-trivial: most manifolds have \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} \neq -R/6\) away from the RNC center.

## §5. The D=4 Coincidence (Physical Content)

Conformal coupling: \(\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} = (D-2)/(4(D-1))\). Equals \(1/6\) iff \(D = 4\).

**In spacetime dimension D=4** (spatial d=3):
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) (composition-forced, universal)
- \(\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} R = R/6\) (conformal invariance condition)
- These are the SAME. Half-density coupling = conformal coupling.

**Physical consequence:** In D=4, the composition-forced scalar couples to curvature conformally. No free parameter \(\xi\) — composition selects \(\xi = 1/6\) uniquely.

**In D ≠ 4:** \(\xi_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1/6 \neq \xi_{\mathrm{conf}}\). Half-density coupling ≠ conformal coupling. An additional \((\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} - 1/6)R\phi^2\) term would be needed for conformal invariance.

## §6. Answer to OQ1a

**Does composition indirectly force curvature coupling?** YES.

The chain: composition (P4.2) → half-density measure → V_HD = -R/6 (at leading order).

**Does this force gravity?** NO.

Composition determines HOW matter couples to a GIVEN curved background. It does not determine WHICH background is realized. The metric is input; the curvature coupling is output.

**Precise statement:**

> Composition is a SELECTION principle for matter-gravity coupling.
> Given \((M,g)\), the coupling \(\xi = 1/6\) is forced (no free parameter).
> The metric \(g\) is not derived from composition.

## §7. Lorentzian Signature

In Hamiltonian path integral on static spacetime:
- Measure at each time slice = \(\prod_k d^d x_k\) (coordinate volume)
- Half-density correction = spatial: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = V_{\mathrm{HD}}(h)\) where \(h_{ij}\) is spatial metric
- Lapse \(N\) enters the action \(S\), not the spatial measure
- All Riemannian witnesses (S², S³, H², Lie groups) give ordering corrections directly

For static de Sitter (\(S^3\) spatial section): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\) (constant, no distortion).

For Schwarzschild: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is position-dependent (spatial R ≠ 0, not constant curvature).

## §8. Connection to Planck Area

If gravity IS present (G available):
- Composition forces \(\hbar\) (P4.2)
- Half-density forces area scale \(L^{d/2}\) in d spatial dimensions
- In D=4 (\(d=3\)): unique area scale from {G,c,ℏ} = \(L_P^2 = G\hbar/c^3\) (Buckingham, THREE-AGENT)
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) with \(R \sim 1/L_P^2\) gives \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} \sim -1/(6L_P^2)\) (Planck-scale correction)

But this is a CONDITIONAL chain: IF gravity exists, THEN Planck area is forced.
Composition alone does not force gravity's existence.

## §9. Summary for Paper

Composition forces curvature coupling \(\xi = 1/6\) universally.
This equals conformal coupling iff \(D = 4\).
The metric is input; the coupling is output.
No Stage 4 ("composition forces gravity") is supported.

These statements are already implicit in the paper (D9.1h-D9.1o + HD-D1.3b).
A concise remark in §9.4 or §10 could make this explicit.

## §10. Universal a_1 = 0 (from mathematician BB5 §10.3)

**Important correction to OQ1a notebook §620:**

The a_1 = 0 observation was listed as a D=4-specific coincidence (iii). But mathematician's BB5 M10.3 shows:

\(a_1(\Delta_{1/2}) = R/6 + V_{\mathrm{HD}} = R/6 - R/6 = 0\)

This holds in ALL dimensions, on ANY Riemannian manifold, because \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) in RNC at every point and \(a_1\) is a local invariant computed in RNC.

**Consequence:** The D=4 coincidence table in OQ1a notebook should be revised:
- (iii) "\(a_1 = 0\)" is NOT specific to D=4. It is universal.
- The genuine D=4 coincidence is ONLY (i) \((\partial\sigma)^2\) cancellation and (ii) \(\xi_{\mathrm{eff}} = \xi_{\mathrm{conf}}\).
- (iii) is a consequence of composition in ALL dimensions, not a dimension-selection criterion.

**Physical meaning:** Composition forces the half-density Laplacian to have no first-order curvature counterterm. This is a universal feature of compositionally correct quantization, not a special D=4 property. The one-loop finiteness of the curvature sector (no \(R\phi^2\) counterterm) is built into the half-density prescription everywhere.

## §11. Lorentzian V_HD: ADM Decomposition (extends D9.1m)

ADM metric: \(ds^2 = -N^2 dt^2 + h_{ij}(dx^i + N^i dt)(dx^j + N^j dt)\).

**Hamiltonian path integral measure:** \(\prod_k d^d x_k\) at each time slice (coordinate volume, not Riemannian volume). Half-density correction involves SPATIAL metric \(h_{ij}\) only:

\[V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{(\text{Lor})} = -h^{1/4}\,\Delta_h\,(h^{-1/4})\]

**Lapse and shift:** \(N, N^i\) enter the action integral
\(S = \int dt\, d^d x\, N\sqrt{h}\,\mathcal{L}\)
but NOT the spatial measure \(\prod d^d x\). No contribution to \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\).

**In spatial RNC:** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{(\text{Lor})} = -{}^{(d)}R/6\) where \({}^{(d)}R\) is the scalar curvature of the spatial section \(({\Sigma_t}, h_{ij})\).

**Gauss-Codazzi:** \({}^{(D)}R = {}^{(d)}R + K^2 - K_{ij}K^{ij} + \text{boundary}\).

Hence: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -{}^{(d)}R/6 = -({}^{(D)}R - K^2 + K_{ij}K^{ij})/6 + \text{boundary}/6\).

**Extrinsic curvature enters only through Gauss-Codazzi**, not through the half-density formula itself.

| Spacetime | Spatial section | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) | \(K_{ij}\) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Minkowski | \(\mathbb{R}^3\) | 0 | 0 |
| Static de Sitter | \(S^3\) | \(-1\) (constant) | 0 |
| Expanding FRW (\(k=+1\)) | \(S^3(a(t))\) | \(-1/a(t)^2\) (time-dep) | \(\dot{a}/a \cdot h_{ij}\) |
| Schwarzschild | non-constant \({}^{(3)}R\) | position-dep | 0 |
| Kerr | non-constant \({}^{(3)}R\) | position-dep | 0 (Boyer-Lindquist \(t\)) |

**Key result:** For static spacetimes (\(K_{ij}=0\)): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{(\text{Lor})} = V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{(\text{Riem})}(\Sigma)\). All existing Riemannian witnesses directly give Lorentzian ordering corrections.

**For non-static** (expanding universe): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) becomes time-dependent through \(h_{ij}(t)\), but at each instant the formula is the same Riemannian expression applied to the instantaneous spatial geometry.

**4D vs 3D half-density:** The spacetime 4D half-density \(|g_4|^{1/4} = N^{1/2}|h|^{1/4}\) involves the lapse. But the Hamiltonian path integral uses the SPATIAL half-density \(|h|^{1/4}\) at each time slice. The \(N^{1/2}\) factor converts proper time to coordinate time and appears in the action weighting, not in the operator ordering. This distinction resolves D9.1m's open question about Lorentzian signature.

## §12. Mathematician Second-Agent Review
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-22 -->

**M12.1 The chain (§1): VERIFIED.**
Each step is a theorem: P4.2 → half-density (composition law + Levy-Khintchine), half-density → V_HD (conjugation definition), V_HD(p) = -R(p)/6 in RNC (standard expansion). The "semi-global" level (§4) should be interpreted carefully: it is not a separate result but a statement about the coordinate patch where RNC is valid. The local statement V_HD(p) = -R(p)/6 is exact at each point p; the "semi-global" extension is the statement that V_HD approximates -R/6 in a neighborhood, which is weaker and less interesting than the local statement.

**M12.2 What composition forces/doesn't (§2-§3): PRECISE.**
The three-item list in §2 is exactly right. Item 3 in §3 ("gravity's existence") correctly delineates the boundary: composition + metric → coupling; but no metric → no coupling. This is the "selection principle" formulation.

**M12.3 Three levels (§4): CORRECT but needs precision.**
The "semi-global" level is slightly imprecise. V_HD = -R/6 is exact at each RNC center but NOT exact in the RNC patch away from the center (where higher-order terms in the metric expansion contribute). Better: "local" means pointwise (at the center of ANY RNC chart), and "global" means the function V_HD equals -R/6 everywhere (which requires additional structure like bi-invariance). There is no useful intermediate level. Suggest: collapse to two levels (local/global).

**M12.4 D=4 coincidence (§5): MATHEMATICALLY CORRECT.**
\(\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} = (D-2)/(4(D-1)) = 1/6\) iff \(D=4\): solve \(3(D-2) = 2(D-1)\), gives \(D=4\). Clean.

**M12.5 OQ1a answer (§6): CORRECT and SHARP.**
"Selection principle for matter-gravity coupling" is the right formulation. The quoted statement is mathematically precise: given \((M,g)\), \(\xi = 1/6\) is determined with no free parameter. The metric is not derived.

**M12.6 a_1 = 0 correction (§10): VERIFIED.**
This is the content of BB4 Theorem M4.1. The correction to the OQ1a notebook is important: (iii) was mislabeled as D=4-specific. It is universal. The physicist's §10 correctly identifies the error and the fix.

**M12.7 Lorentzian ADM (§11): MATHEMATICALLY VERIFIED.**
- ADM decomposition: standard (\(ds^2 = -N^2 dt^2 + h_{ij}(dx^i+N^idt)(dx^j+N^jdt)\)).
- Spatial half-density: \(|h|^{1/4}\) acts on the spatial measure at each time slice. CORRECT.
- Gauss-Codazzi: \({}^{(D)}R = {}^{(d)}R + K^2 - K_{ij}K^{ij} + 2\nabla_\mu(n^\mu K - a^\mu)\). The boundary term involves the acceleration \(a^\mu = n^\nu\nabla_\nu n^\mu\) and is often dropped. For compact spatial sections (S^3, T^3), it vanishes. CORRECT.
- Static spacetimes (\(K_{ij}=0\)): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\Sigma)\) exactly. All Riemannian witnesses apply. CORRECT.
- FRW (\(k=+1\)): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1/a(t)^2\). On \(S^3\) of radius \(a\): \(R(S^3) = 6/a^2\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6 = -1/a^2\). CORRECT.
- \(N^{1/2}\) factor: enters the action weighting, not the spatial measure. This is the standard Hamiltonian reduction: the lapse is a Lagrange multiplier for the Hamiltonian constraint, not part of the kinetic measure. CORRECT.

**M12.8 Sev-3 note on §7 (Lorentzian).**
The statement "lapse N enters the action S, not the spatial measure" is correct for the canonical path integral but needs a caveat: in the covariant (Lagrangian) path integral, one integrates over ALL spacetime metrics including N. The distinction between "action" and "measure" is sharper in the Hamiltonian formulation. This is implicit in §11 but §7 states it without the Hamiltonian qualifier.

**M12.9 Table (§11): VERIFIED.**
- Minkowski: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = 0\), \(K=0\). CORRECT.
- Static de Sitter: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\) (unit S^3), \(K=0\). CORRECT.
- FRW: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1/a^2\), \(K_{ij} = \dot{a}/a\cdot h_{ij}\) (isotropic). CORRECT.
- Schwarzschild/Kerr: non-constant spatial curvature, position-dependent V_HD. CORRECT.

**Verdict: APPROVE. Clean synthesis of OQ1a. Lorentzian extension is mathematically sound.**

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT (physicist + mathematician). APPROVED.**

## §13. OQ-FdV-1: V_HD on Symmetric Spaces G/H
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-22 -->

**Question:** Does \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|\rho|^2\) extend from Lie groups \(G\) to symmetric spaces \(G/H\)?

### §13.1. Why Constancy Fails on G/H

On \(G\): bi-invariance of metric \(\Rightarrow\) \(|g|\) bi-invariant \(\Rightarrow\) \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) constant (Prop M0.1).

On \(G/H\): metric is \(G\)-invariant but \(|g|\) in a coordinate chart is NOT constant (it depends on the chart, not just the metric). The key difference: \(G\) acts transitively on \(G/H\), but the coordinate-volume density \(|g(x)|\) transforms nontrivially under \(G\) unless the chart is adapted to the symmetry.

**Concrete witness:** \(S^2 = \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathrm{U}(1)\) in spherical coords: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1/4 - 1/(4\sin^2\theta)\). Non-constant. **Already established (BB4/BB6, FOUR-AGENT).**

### §13.2. Naive Extension: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} \stackrel{?}{=} -(|\rho_G|^2 - |\rho_H|^2)\)

Test on \(S^2 = \mathrm{SU}(2)/\mathrm{U}(1)\):
- \(|\rho_G|^2 = 1/4\) (SU(2), Killing norm \(|\alpha|^2=2\))
- \(|\rho_H|^2 = 0\) (U(1) abelian, no positive roots)
- Prediction: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1/4\) (constant)

**Reality:** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6 = -1/3\) at RNC center (\(R_{S^2}=2\) unit sphere). Non-constant globally. Value at equator in spherical coords: \(-1/2\).

**FAILS.** Neither the constant value nor the RNC value match \(-1/4\).

### §13.3. What Works: Local RNC Value

At every point \(p \in G/H\): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) in RNC at \(p\). This is universal (Thm M0.3 logic, step 1-3).

For Einstein spaces \(G/H\) (\(\mathrm{Ric} = \lambda g\)): \(R = \lambda \dim(G/H)\), so \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -\lambda \dim(G/H)/6\) at RNC center.

| Space | \(\dim\) | \(R\) | \(-R/6\) | \(|\rho_G|^2 - |\rho_H|^2\) | Match? |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|--------------------------|--------|
| \(S^2\) | 2 | 2 | \(-1/3\) | \(1/4\) | NO |
| \(S^3 = \mathrm{SU}(2)\) | 3 | 6 | \(-1\) | \(1/4\) (but different norm) | (special) |
| \(\mathbb{CP}^2\) | 4 | 24 | \(-4\) | \(2 - 1/4 = 7/4\)? | NO |

The mismatch is systematic: \(-R/6\) on \(G/H\) involves the curvature of the QUOTIENT geometry, while \(|\rho_G|^2 - |\rho_H|^2\) involves the root systems. These are related but not equal.

### §13.4. The Spectral Approach

**Alternative question:** Does the half-density SPECTRUM on \(G/H\) involve \(\rho\)-shifts?

On \(G/H\), \(\mathrm{Spec}(-\Delta) = \{C_2^G(\lambda) : \lambda \in \hat{G}, \, (\lambda|_H)^H \neq 0\}\).

Half-density spectrum: \(\mathrm{Spec}(\Delta_{1/2}) = \{C_2^G(\lambda) + V_{\mathrm{HD}}\}\) — but \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is NOT constant on \(G/H\). So the half-density Hamiltonian does NOT simply shift eigenvalues.

**Key difference from Lie groups:** On \(G\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = \text{const}\) means \(\Delta_{1/2}\) and \(-\Delta_g\) share eigenfunctions, with shifted eigenvalues. On \(G/H\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(x)\) is a nontrivial potential — the half-density Hamiltonian has DIFFERENT eigenfunctions from \(-\Delta_{G/H}\).

### §13.5. What IS Special About Lie Groups

The FdV/V_HD identity works on Lie groups because of a unique confluence:

1. **Bi-invariance** → \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) constant (Prop M0.1)
2. **RNC evaluation** → \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) at any point (standard)
3. **Bracket-curvature** → \(R = d/(4c)\) for \(g = -cB\)
4. **FdV** → \(|\rho|^2 = d/(24c)\)
5. **Combined:** \(-R/6 = -d/(24c) = -|\rho|^2\)

Step 1 FAILS for \(G/H\) (generically). Without constancy, the chain breaks: \(-R/6\) is only a local (RNC) value, not the global \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\).

### §13.6. Verdict on OQ-FdV-1

**The FdV identity \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|\rho|^2\) does NOT extend to symmetric spaces \(G/H\).**

The obstruction is constancy: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is generically non-constant on \(G/H\), so no single number can characterize it. The local identity \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) holds universally but does not reduce to a root-system formula on quotients.

**Positive statement:** The FdV identity is specific to GROUP manifolds with bi-invariant metrics. This makes the Lie group case genuinely special — the composition-forced ordering correction has a clean representation-theoretic interpretation ONLY when the configuration space is itself a group.

**Physical implication:** For a particle on a group manifold \(G\) (rigid body, gauge theory on lattice), the ordering correction is the \(\rho\)-shift. For a particle on a coset space \(G/H\) (constrained motion, sigma model target), the ordering correction is a nontrivial position-dependent potential that cannot be expressed in terms of Weyl vectors alone.

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (physicist). OQ-FdV-1 RESOLVED (negative).**
