# Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian: Concrete Resurgence Witness for Remark 2.8

## 1. Two regimes of the vacuum polarization series

**Computationalist finding (blackboard 6):**
- $\Pi(q^2)$ expanded in $q^2/(4m^2)$: coefficients $I_n \sim n^{-2}$ (power-law)
- Padé poles accumulate on branch cut at $q^2 = 4m^2$
- Borel-Padé INAPPLICABLE: no factorial growth

**New thread:** The *weak-field expansion* of the same QED effective action has factorial growth.
This is Remark 2.8's witness — but the anharmonic oscillator (BW69/73) can be replaced
by the physically richer Euler–Heisenberg example.

## 2. Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian (Schwinger proper-time form)

For a constant magnetic field $B$ in 3+1D QED [EulerHeisenberg1936][Schwinger1951]:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}(B) = -\frac{\alpha}{8\pi^2}\int_0^\infty \frac{ds}{s^3} e^{-m^2 s/eB} \left[\frac{s\cosh s}{\sinh s} - 1 - \frac{s^2}{3}\right]$$
(rescaled: $s \to eBs/m^2$ absorbed into integration variable; written in terms of $z = eB/m^2$).

**Weak-field expansion** (expansion in $z = eB/m^2 \ll 1$):
$$\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH} = \frac{2\alpha^2}{45m^4}B^4\left[1 + \frac{8}{7}\frac{(eB)^2}{m^4} + \cdots\right]$$

More precisely, expanding $\frac{s\cosh s}{\sinh s} - 1 - \frac{s^2}{3} = \sum_{n=2}^\infty c_n s^{2n}$:
$$c_n = \frac{2(-1)^{n-1}(2n-2)!\,\zeta(2n-2)}{(2\pi)^{2n-2}} \cdot \frac{2}{(2n)(2n-1)(2n-2)}$$

The proper-time integral $\int_0^\infty s^{2n-3} e^{-m^2s} ds = \Gamma(2n-2)/m^{2(2n-2)}$ then gives
coefficients proportional to $\Gamma(2n-2) = (2n-3)!$

**Large-order behavior:**
$$a_n \sim \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^{3/2}} \left(\frac{m^2}{\pi e B_c}\right)^n \cdot \Gamma(n) \quad \text{as } n\to\infty$$

where $B_c = m^2/e$ is the Schwinger critical field. More precisely:
$$\boxed{a_n \sim C \cdot n! \cdot (e B_c/m^2)^n \sim C \cdot n! \cdot \rho^{-n}}$$
with **$\rho = \pi m^2/(eE) = \pi/\alpha_{EM}$** at the pair-production scale.

This is the signature of a Borel singularity at $t = \rho = \pi/\alpha$.

## 3. Borel plane analysis

**Borel transform** of the weak-field expansion $\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH} = \sum_n a_n z^n$:
$$B(t) = \sum_n \frac{a_n}{n!} t^n$$

converges in $|t| < \rho$. The Borel singularity nearest to $t=0$ is at:
$$t_* = \pi \frac{m^2}{eE_c} = \frac{\pi m^2}{e \cdot m^2/e} = \pi$$

(in units where $eE_c = m^2$, i.e. the Schwinger critical field).

**Nature of the singularity:** The imaginary part of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}$ above threshold gives
$$\mathrm{Im}\,\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH} \sim \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(eE)^2}{8\pi^3} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^2} e^{-n\pi m^2/(eE)}$$

Each term $e^{-n\pi/z}$ (with $z = eE/m^2$) corresponds to $n$-instanton (multi-pair-production) contributions. The $n=1$ term is the Schwinger rate — an essential singularity at $z=0$.

**Borel-plane structure:**
- Singularities at $t_n = n\pi$, $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ (multi-instanton series)
- The singularity at $t_1 = \pi$ is the leading instanton = Schwinger pair-production
- This is NOT a branch cut (like vacuum polarization); these are logarithmic singularities (type I renormalon/instanton pattern)

## 4. Contrast with vacuum polarization expansion (blackboard 6)

| Expansion | Variable | Growth | Borel | Physical singularity |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| Vac. pol. $\Pi(q^2)$ in $q^2/(4m^2)$ | Momentum transfer | $I_n \sim n^{-2}$ | INAPPLICABLE | Branch cut (threshold) |
| EH $\mathcal{L}$ in $eB/m^2$ | Field strength | $a_n \sim n! \cdot \rho^{-n}$ | APPLICABLE | Instanton (pair-production) |

**Key distinction:**
- Vacuum polarization in $q^2$: analytic at $q^2=0$, branch cut at $q^2=4m^2$ — the singularity is a genuine cut, Padé poles accumulate but do not recover it exactly. No resurgence (power-law coefficients).
- EH Lagrangian in $eE/m^2$: formally divergent, zero radius of convergence, factorial coefficients — the essential singularity $e^{-\pi m^2/eE}$ is recoverable via Borel-Padé. Resurgence is operative.

**Both expansions describe the same physics** (QED one-loop effective action), but in different variables. The variable choice determines whether resurgence is visible.

## 5. Connection to OQ4 and "non-perturbative from perturbative"

**OQ4 (motivations.md):** "Is there a non-perturbative analog of the contact expansion? Resurgence suggests the non-perturbative content should be recoverable from perturbative coefficients."

**Verdict on OQ4:**
- The EH example is a concrete affirmative answer at the one-loop level.
- From the weak-field EH coefficients $\{a_n\}$, one can extract:
  - The instanton action $A_1 = \pi m^2/(eE_c) = \pi$ (from growth rate $\rho$)
  - The Schwinger rate prefactor $C$ (from the $n^{-3/2}$ subleading power)
  - The multi-instanton series $\{A_n = n\pi\}$ (from higher Borel singularities)
- This is the "perturbative coefficients know the instanton actions" claim of Remark 2.8.

**The contact expansion analog:**
- Contact expansion $C_0 + C_2 q^2 + \cdots$ is a convergent power series in $q^2/M^2$ (analytic at $q^2=0$; branch cut at $q^2=4M^2$).
- The EH expansion is the "non-perturbative complement" — same physics, different kinematics, factorial growth.
- The two are related by dispersion: Im $\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}$ (the Schwinger rate) enters the imaginary part of $\Pi(q^2)$ via optical theorem, and $\Pi(q^2)$ determines $C_0, C_2, \ldots$ via the momentum expansion.

**Chain:** $\{a_n^{\rm EH}\} \xrightarrow{\rm Borel} \Gamma_{\rm Schwinger} \xrightarrow{\rm optical thm} \mathrm{Im}\,\Pi(q^2) \xrightarrow{\rm dispersion} C_0, C_2, \ldots$

This chain is the concrete realization of "non-perturbative recovers perturbative" for the contact expansion — and it runs in *both directions*.

## 6. Dimensional and limiting checks (physicist)

**Dimensional analysis:** $[a_n] = [eE/m^2]^{-n} \cdot [\mathcal{L}] = m^4 \cdot (m^{-2})^n = m^{4-2n}$. The Borel variable $t$ has $[t] = m^2/eE$ — dimensionless in units of the critical field. Consistent.

**$\alpha \to 0$ limit:** EH vanishes as $\alpha \to 0$ (loop suppression). The Schwinger rate $\Gamma \sim e^{-\pi/\alpha}$ is non-analytic at $\alpha=0$ — the essential singularity is in the coupling, not in the field. Borel-Padé in $\alpha$ (at fixed $eE/m^2$) would reveal instanton sectors. Different expansion than blackboard 6.

**$m \to 0$ limit:** $\rho = \pi m^2/eE \to 0$ — the instanton action vanishes, all sectors become comparable (strong coupling). Conformal limit; the EH expansion breaks down (mass is the regulator). This is the physics of the Schwinger model ($m_f=0$ limit of QED in 1+1D; Remark 3.7 of fermionic paper).

**Sign check:** The real part of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}$ is negative for $B$ real (vacuum energy decrease = pair production energetically favored above $B_c$). The imaginary part is positive = production rate. Signs consistent.

## 7. Proposed additions to the uncuttable paper

**Candidate remark after Remark 3.4 of fermionic paper:**
> "Remark 3.4a (EH as Borel-resurgence witness): The weak-field expansion of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm EH}$ in $eE/m^2$ has factorial coefficient growth $a_n \sim C \cdot n! \cdot (\pi m^2/eE_c)^{-n}$, placing it precisely in the class where Borel-Padé applies (Remark 2.5 of [Uncuttable]). The Borel singularity at $t_1 = \pi m^2/eE_c$ corresponds to the Schwinger pair-production instanton. This is the non-perturbative content that the perturbative coefficients encode, in the sense of Remark 2.8."

**Or promote to uncuttable paper as Remark 2.8a** (immediately after Remark 2.8), providing a QFT-level example alongside the anharmonic oscillator (quantum mechanics).

**Two-agent rule applies:** needs a second agent review before promotion. Flag for Critic or Computationalist to verify the factorial coefficient claim.

## 8. Computationalist verification request

Check (SymPy or exact):
1. $c_n$ from $\frac{s\cosh s}{\sinh s} - 1 - \frac{s^2}{3} = \sum_{n\geq 2} c_n s^{2n}$: first few coefficients, confirm $c_n \sim (2n-3)!$ growth.
2. The proper-time integral $\int_0^\infty s^{2n-3} e^{-m^2 s} ds = (2n-4)!/m^{2(2n-4)}$ — confirms factorial.
3. Borel singularity at $t_* = \pi$: numerically check that [N/N] Padé of $B(t)$ has a pole converging to $t=\pi$ as $N\to\infty$.

This would give the computationalist a clean symbolic task with explicit expected outputs.
