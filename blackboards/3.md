# Blackboard 3 — Half-Density vs Moyal Ordering Comparison (D35/S290)
Date: 2026-02-14

## Scope
Compare half-density conjugation (Section 10.2, D9.1d) with Weyl/Moyal ordering (Section 7) and Born-Jordan ordering (de Gosson).

## Test Symbols
1. H = p^2/(2m) + V(q) — standard Hamiltonian
2. H = f(q)p^2 — position-dependent mass kinetic energy
3. H = qp — dilation generator (D23/S280 benchmark)

---

## I. Flat Space: H = p^2/(2m) + V(q)

### Half-density prescription
- g_{ij} = delta_{ij}, so |g| = 1, |g|^{1/4} = 1
- Conjugation map U: psi -> |g|^{1/4} psi = psi (identity)
- Kinetic operator: -(hbar^2/2m) Delta_g = -(hbar^2/2m) d^2/dx^2
- Potential: V(q) (multiplication operator, unchanged)

### Weyl/Moyal prescription
- p^2/(2m): Moyal product p \star_M p = p^2 (no correction, quadratic in p only)
- Weyl quantization of p^2: hat{p}^2 = -hbar^2 d^2/dx^2
- Kinetic operator: -(hbar^2/2m) d^2/dx^2
- V(q): Weyl quantization of V(q) = V(hat{q}) (no correction for q-only functions)

### Born-Jordan prescription
- For separable H = T(p) + V(q), Born-Jordan = Weyl (both reduce to standard ordering)
- Difference arises only for mixed q-p symbols

### **Result (flat, separable):** All three prescriptions agree exactly.
\[
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(q)
\]

## II. Curved Space / Position-Dependent Mass: H = g^{ij}(q) p_i p_j / 2

### Half-density prescription (D9.1d)
Start from Laplace-Beltrami on L^2(M, dvol_g):
\[
H_g = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\Delta_g, \quad \Delta_g = |g|^{-1/2}\partial_i(|g|^{1/2}g^{ij}\partial_j)
\]
Conjugate to L^2(M, dx) via U: psi -> |g|^{1/4} psi:
\[
\widetilde{H}_g = |g|^{1/4} H_g |g|^{-1/4}
\]

**Explicit expansion in 1D** with metric g(q), inverse g^{-1}(q):
\[
\Delta_g = g^{-1/2}\partial_q(g^{1/2}g^{-1}\partial_q) = g^{-1}\partial_q^2 + \frac{1}{2}g^{-1}(\partial_q \ln g)\partial_q
\]
After conjugation by |g|^{1/4}:
\[
\widetilde{H}_g = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\left[g^{-1}\partial_q^2 + Q_{HD}(q)\right]
\]
where Q_{HD} is a potential-like term (no first-derivative operator):
\[
Q_{HD} = \frac{1}{4}g^{-1}(\partial_q \ln g)^2\left(\frac{1}{4} - 1\right) + \frac{1}{2}g^{-1}\partial_q^2(\ln |g|^{1/4})
\]

**Key structural property:** The first-derivative term d/dq is eliminated. Principal symbol: g^{ij}(q)p_ip_j/2.

### Left ordering (D9.1e)
\[
H_L = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2}g^{ij}(x)\partial_i\partial_j
\]
Symmetry defect:
\[
\langle u, H_L v\rangle_{dx} - \langle H_L u, v\rangle_{dx} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}\int dx\;(\partial_i g^{ij})(\bar{u}\partial_j v - (\partial_j\bar{u})v)
\]
Non-symmetric unless dg^{ij} = 0 in chosen chart.

### Weyl ordering (Remark D9.1a)
For A(q,p) = f(q)p^2:
\[
Q_W(fp^2) = Q_L(fp^2) - i\hbar f'(\hat{q})\hat{p} - \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 f''(\hat{q})
\]
Contains O(hbar) first-derivative term: -i\hbar f'(q) d/dq.

### Comparison table (1D, f(q) = g^{-1}(q))
| Prescription | Principal symbol | O(hbar) term | O(hbar^2) term |
|---|---|---|---|
| Left | f(q)(-hbar^2)d^2/dq^2 | 0 | 0 |
| Weyl | same | -i\hbar f'(q) d/dq | -(hbar^2/4)f''(q) |
| Half-density | same | **0** (eliminated by conjugation) | geometric potential Q_{HD} |
| Born-Jordan | same | differs from Weyl by O(hbar) | differs from Weyl by O(hbar^2) |

### **Result (curved/position-dependent):**
1. **Principal symbol identical** across all prescriptions.
2. Half-density eliminates the first-derivative (connection) term, matching neither Weyl nor Left ordering in subleading terms.
3. Weyl retains a first-derivative O(hbar) correction.
4. Half-density adds a different O(hbar^2) scalar potential (geometric curvature term).

## III. Test Case: H = qp (Dilation Generator)

### Weyl ordering (Section 7, Moyal product)
\[
q \star_M p = qp + i\hbar/2
\]
\[
\hat{H}_{Weyl} = \frac{1}{2}(\hat{q}\hat{p} + \hat{p}\hat{q}) = -i\hbar(q\,d/dq + 1/2)
\]

### Half-density on R_+ (D23/S280 notebook)
Configuration space R_+ with metric g from dq:
- |g|^{1/4} = 1 (flat space, Lebesgue measure)
- Half-density gives same answer as Weyl: alpha = 1/2

But more precisely: the dilation generator on L^2(R_+, dq) is:
\[
A = -i\hbar(q\,d/dq + 1/2) = H_{1/2}
\]
This is the Stone generator of U(s)psi(q) = e^{s/2}psi(e^s q), where the e^{s/2} factor is exactly the half-density Jacobian |dq'/dq|^{1/2} = e^{s/2}.

**Key insight:** The alpha = 1/2 selection from unitarity (S280) IS the half-density prescription. The e^{s/2} prefactor in the unitary dilation group is |Jacobian|^{1/2} — this is the half-density weight.

### Born-Jordan ordering
For qp (linear in both q and p), Born-Jordan = Weyl = (qp + pq)/2. Agreement is exact.

### **Result (H = qp):** All three agree. Half-density = Weyl = Born-Jordan for bilinear symbols.

## IV. Where Prescriptions Diverge: f(q)p^2

### Explicit O(hbar) difference
**Weyl vs Half-density** for H = f(q)p^2 (1D):

Weyl gives (in position representation):
\[
\hat{H}_W = -\hbar^2\left[f\,\partial_q^2 + f'\,\partial_q + \frac{1}{4}f''\right]
\]

Half-density (via Laplace-Beltrami with g^{-1} = 2f/hbar^2) gives:
\[
\widetilde{H}_{HD} = -\hbar^2\left[f\,\partial_q^2 + \text{(scalar curvature potential)}\right]
\]

**The f' partial_q term is absent in half-density.** This is the structural difference.

### Physical interpretation
- Weyl: preserves phase-space symmetry (symmetric under q <-> p exchange)
- Half-density: preserves L^2(dx) symmetry of kinetic operator (no boundary terms in integration by parts)
- The difference is the "connection term" f' partial_q

## V. Stratification of the Freedom

### Layer 1: Principal symbol (classical, O(hbar^0))
All prescriptions agree: H_cl = g^{ij}p_ip_j/2 + V(q).

### Layer 2: Connection / first-derivative term (O(hbar))
- **Left ordering**: no correction (but breaks symmetry)
- **Weyl ordering**: adds -i\hbar f' partial_q (symmetric on flat space, not on curved)
- **Half-density**: eliminates connection term (symmetric on any manifold by construction)
- **Born-Jordan**: adds different O(hbar) correction (de Gosson: BJ != Weyl for degree >= 2)

Half-density fixes Layer 2 **uniquely** for kinetic operators.

### Layer 3: Scalar potential corrections (O(hbar^2))
- Weyl: -(hbar^2/4)f''
- Half-density: geometric scalar curvature potential
- Born-Jordan: yet another O(hbar^2) correction
- These differences are **within Section 7's deformation equivalence class**.

### Layer 4: Domain / self-adjoint extension (O(hbar^0) but non-perturbative)
D9.1f witness: same symbol, different boundary data -> inequivalent quantum theories.
Neither ordering prescription nor half-density addresses this; it requires additional input.

## VI. Verdict

**The tension is apparent, not real. Resolution is scope-dependent.**

### Precise statement:
1. **Section 7 claim** (P5.2): Different star products are related by formal automorphisms T_hbar, preserving the classical limit. Scope: formal/asymptotic deformation equivalence of the algebra.

2. **Section 10.2 claim** (D9.1a, D9.1d): Half-density conjugation selects a canonical kinetic operator with no connection term. Scope: operator realization on L^2, symmetry/self-adjointness.

3. **Compatibility:** Half-density is a **specific representative** within the deformation equivalence class that has the distinguished property of being symmetric (self-adjoint) on L^2(M, dx) for any Riemannian manifold.

### Analogy:
Section 7 says "all gauges are equivalent" (deformation freedom).
Section 10.2 says "this gauge is distinguished" (half-density = Lorenz gauge analog).
No contradiction: a gauge choice can be canonical without breaking gauge equivalence.

### Scope boundaries:
- Half-density fixes the kinetic operator uniquely (Layer 2 above)
- Deformation freedom persists for O(hbar^2) scalar corrections (Layer 3)
- Domain/extension freedom persists entirely (Layer 4)
- For separable H = T(p) + V(q) on flat space: all prescriptions agree, no tension visible

### Sharp answer to D35:
**Option 2 from D35-plan: Scope clarification.** Half-density fixes the principal-symbol realization (connection term) uniquely. The O(hbar^n) deformation freedom of Section 7 persists at subleading scalar level. The two sections address different layers of the quantization problem and are complementary.
