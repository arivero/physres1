# Mollifier–Polygon Refinement Parallel
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S206

## The parallel

Both mollifier localization (Theorem 2.1 in the dirac-probes satellite)
and Newton's polygonal construction (cornerstone §3) share a
"probe-then-refine" architecture with the same logical stages:

| Stage | Mollifier (Thm 2.1) | Polygon (§3.2) |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1. Global/discrete invariant | δS[q;η]=0 for all η ∈ C_c^∞ | ΔA_k = L·Δt/(2m) for all k |
| 2. Refinement parameter | ε (mollifier width) | Δt (impulse spacing) |
| 3. Exact at every finite scale | ∫F[q]·ρ_ε(t−t₀)u dt = 0 | Area law exact at every N |
| 4. Limit extraction | ε→0: F[q](t₀) = 0 | Δt→0: dA/dt = L/(2m) |

## The structural point

In both cases, the invariant is **not produced by the limit** — it exists
exactly at every finite scale. The limit merely converts:
- a global/averaged condition → a pointwise/continuous one (mollifier),
- a piecewise-linear/discrete orbit → a smooth curve (polygon).

The key hypothesis that enables the limit is **local regularity**:
- Mollifier: continuity of F[q] at t₀ (hypothesis H3 of Theorem 2.1).
- Polygon: consistent refinement so the polygonal trajectory converges
  to a differentiable curve (Newton's Lemma 3 / Nauenberg's reconstruction).

Without the regularity gate, both limits can fail:
- If F[q] is discontinuous, the mollifier limit gives only distributional
  information (corner/impulse conditions, Theorems 3.1–3.2).
- If the polygon vertices accumulate badly, the limit trajectory need not
  be differentiable (Pourciau's cautionary analysis).

## The bridge: Section 4.5 (N impulses → path integral)

The dirac-probes paper contains a third instance of the same pattern
in Section 4.5:

| Stage | N-impulse time slicing (§4.5) |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| 1. Discrete invariant | S_N[{q_k}] additive, composition at each junction |
| 2. Refinement parameter | Δt = T/(N+1) |
| 3. Exact at every finite N | Classical: ∂S_N/∂q_k = 0 ⟹ momentum continuity |
| 4. Limit | N→∞: path integral K(q_f,q_i;T) |

Here the regularity gate is the **half-density normalization**:
the factor (m/(2πiℏΔt))^((N+1)/2) is forced by composition at each
intermediate integration, and it is this normalization (not a formal
Lebesgue measure on paths) that makes the N→∞ limit well-defined.

## Threefold connection to the paper's thesis

The three instances of "probe-then-refine" correspond to three sections
of the cornerstone's narrative:

1. §3 (polygon): refinement of geometry → continuous dynamics.
2. §5 (mollifier): refinement of test functions → pointwise EL equations.
3. §6 (time-slicing): refinement of composition → path integral.

All three exhibit the same architecture: **exact invariant at finite
scale, local regularity as the gate for the limit, specific control
mechanism when the regularity fails.**

The difference in limit failure modes gives the paper's three control
mechanisms:
- Smooth limit exists → classical mechanics (§§3–4).
- Distributional limit (corners/impulses) → contact conditions (§5).
- Divergent limit (no naive ∫Dq) → renormalization (§§7–8).

## Proposed remark for dirac-probes (after Remark 2.2)

**Remark 2.3 (Structural parallel with polygonal refinement).**
The mollifier-localization argument of Theorem 2.1 shares its logical
structure with Newton's polygonal construction (cornerstone, Section 3):
both begin with an invariant that holds exactly at finite resolution
(stationarity against every test function / equal areas at every polygon
step), introduce a refinement parameter (ε / Δt), and extract a
continuous/pointwise statement in the limit under a local regularity
hypothesis. The equal-area law is exact at every polygon step; the
stationarity integral vanishes at every mollifier width. In the
time-slicing bridge of Section 4.5, the same pattern recurs with the
half-density normalization playing the role of the regularity gate.
This threefold repetition is a structural instance of the cornerstone's
thesis: physical laws emerge as controlled limits of composable
local refinements.

## Caveats
1. The parallel is structural, not a formal equivalence: the spaces and
   parameters differ (function space vs. configuration space).
2. The regularity hypotheses are of different mathematical type (continuity
   of a functional vs. convergence of a geometric sequence).
3. The remark should not overstate: "shares its logical structure" rather
   than "is the same theorem."
