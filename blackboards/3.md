# Composition-Law Derivations of QM: Literature Landscape

## Three Families

### A. Dynamical Composition (propagators/amplitudes over time)

**A1. Our P4.2** — composition semigroup as single axiom
- K(c,t₃|a,t₁) = ∫ K(c,t₃|b,t₂) K(b,t₂|a,t₁) db
- (C) + physical setup → exp(iS/ℏ), d/2, Levy exclusion
- Tools: Levy-Khintchine, characteristic exponents
- Scope: QM + deformation quantization + RG (full RCP stack)

**A2. Luiz-de Oliveira ITA (arXiv:2602.09984, Feb 2026)** — NEW, CRITICAL
- Action density convolution: g(A;c,T₁+T₂|a) = ∫ db dA' g(A';b,T₁|a) g(A-A';c,T₂|b)
- Three axioms: action additivity + Cramer-Rao + normalization
- exp(iηA) from: |χ|=1 constraint (real exponentials diverge/decay)
- Levy-Khintchine → Gaussian (same mathematical mechanism as P4.2)
- Derives: d/2 exponent, Schrodinger eq, [x,p]=iℏ, E-L equations
- **HIGH OVERLAP with P4.2.** Same thesis, different proof technique.
- NO deformation quantization, NO RCP, NO RG channel
- Same group as earlier work already cited (ref P4.2i)

**A3. Caticha entropic dynamics (2009-2025)**
- QM as Hamilton-Killing flow on statistical manifold
- MaxEnt + information geometry → Schrodinger equation
- Not compositional per se; inference replaces dynamics
- Recent: QED extension (Entropy 2025)

### B. Kinematic Composition (systems/states)

**B1. Goyal-Knuth-Skilling 2010** (ref 24, ALREADY CITED)
- Sequential measurement composition → complex amplitudes + Born rule
- No dynamics, no path integral, no ℏ necessity

**B2. Chiribella-D'Ariano-Perinotti 2011**
- 6 axioms: causality, purity of composition, local discriminability, etc.
- Purification postulate central; monoidal category structure
- Finite-dim QM only; no ℏ derivation

**B3. Masanes-Mueller 2011**
- Tomographic locality + continuous reversibility
- Rules out real/quaternionic; selects complex QM
- Active 2025 debate: Kent critique vs Masanes-Galley-Mueller response (Quantum 9, 1592)

**B4. Dakic-Brukner 2009**
- 4 axioms: information capacity, subspace, local tomography, continuous reversibility

**B5. Hardy 2001** — 5 axioms + simplicity postulate

### C. Measure-Theoretic / Interference Hierarchy

**C1. Sorkin 1994** — quantum measure theory
- Grade-2 sum rule: μ(A∪B∪C) expanded; no 3rd-order interference
- Born rule = grade-2 additivity
- Experimentally: 3rd-order < 10⁻² of 2nd-order

**C2. Barnum-Mueller-Ududec 2014**
- No higher-order interference → R/C/H QM + octonionic d=3

## Assessment for P4.2

### What P4.2 does uniquely (no other program):
1. Single axiom: composition alone (others need 3-6)
2. Deformation quantization bridge (star product from composition)
3. RG as Stage 3 (composition → QM → QFT chain)
4. RCP taxonomy (partition/representation/scale)
5. d/2 from dimensional analysis (cleanest known)
6. "Refinement compatibility" — ZERO external hits (confirmed unique)

### What Luiz-de Oliveira ITA adds:
1. Cramer-Rao route to exp(iS/ℏ) — alternative proof, possibly more transparent
2. Lagrangian emergence from composition stationary phase
3. Information-geometric interpretation
4. **Published on arXiv first (Feb 2026)**

### Priority and citation obligations:
- arXiv:2602.09984 MUST be cited in cornerstone before submission
- Independent confirmation of P4.2's thesis strengthens our claim
- Differentiation is clear: we go further (deformation quant, RG, RCP)
- Framing: "Luiz-de Oliveira [ref] independently derive the quantum propagator from action additivity using information-theoretic methods; our approach recovers their result as a special case of the broader RCP framework."

### Family B programs: NOT competitors to P4.2
- They derive state-space structure (Hilbert space, complex numbers, Born rule)
- They do NOT derive dynamics (path integral, Schrodinger equation from composition)
- P4.2 is dynamical; B-family is kinematic
- Complementary, not competing. GKS (ref 24) correctly positioned as "kinematic complement"

## Action Item Status
- arXiv:2602.09984 ALREADY CITED as ref 23 (Remark P4.2i, line 641-642)
- Comparison in P4.2i verified accurate (critic Session 11)
- **NO FURTHER ACTION NEEDED** — prior art coverage complete

## §M1. Mathematician Second-Agent: Mathematical Comparison P4.2 vs Luiz-de Oliveira
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-21 -->

**M1.1 Common mathematical core:**
Both P4.2 and LdO use the SAME mathematical backbone:
1. Convolution semigroup structure (additive → multiplicative via Fourier/characteristic function)
2. Levy-Khintchine classification of infinitely divisible distributions
3. Physical regularity (continuity, locality) → Gaussian component dominates

**M1.2 Entry point comparison:**

| | P4.2 | LdO |
|---|---|---|
| Object | Kernel \(K(x,y;t)\) | Action density \(g(A;x,T|y)\) |
| Composition | \(\int K K' \, db\) (spatial) | \(\int g g' \, db\,dA'\) (spatial+action) |
| Fourier variable | momentum \(p\) | action parameter \(\eta\) |
| Key step | \(\hat{K}_t(p) = e^{t\psi(p)}\), L-K on \(\psi\) | \(\chi(\eta) = e^{i\eta A}\), \(|\chi|=1\) forces oscillatory |
| Regularity | (I) + (D) + L^2 unitarity | Cramer-Rao + normalization |
| Output | \(e^{c_0 S/\kappa}\), d/2 | \(e^{i\eta A}\), Schrodinger, [x,p]=iℏ |

**M1.3 Mathematical verdict:**
The two derivations are NOT mathematically equivalent — they are two distinct SPECIALIZATIONS of the same abstract theorem (Levy-Khintchine classification of continuous convolution semigroups on locally compact abelian groups).

- P4.2 specializes to the GROUP \((\mathbb{R}^d, +)\) (position space). Composition is convolution of kernels.
- LdO specializes to the GROUP \((\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}, +)\) (position × action space). Composition is joint convolution.
- LdO has an extra dimension (action \(A\)) which P4.2 does not carry as an explicit variable.
- P4.2 is more abstract (works with arbitrary characteristic exponents, not just Gaussian); LdO restricts early via Cramer-Rao.

**M1.4 What this means for citation:**
- CONCUR with critic: citation is MANDATORY (independent parallel derivation).
- Framing: both derive from the same mathematical theorem (L-K) but via different physical routes.
- P4.2 differentiation: (1) single axiom (vs 3 for LdO), (2) deformation quantization bridge, (3) RG/scale channel, (4) full RCP taxonomy.
- LdO differentiation: (1) Cramer-Rao information-theoretic motivation, (2) explicit Lagrangian emergence from stationary phase, (3) published first.

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT (critic + mathematician). CONCUR on citation obligation and differentiation.**
