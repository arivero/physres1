# OQ1a: Composition → Curvature Coupling → What?

## §1. The Chain

```
P4.2 (composition) → half-density measure → V_HD = -|g|^{1/4} Δ(|g|^{-1/4})
```

At RNC center: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) for ANY \((M,g)\) (BB0 §13).

On Lie groups: constancy (Prop M0.1) → \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) **everywhere** (Thm M0.3).

On constant-curvature: \(V_{\mathrm{HD,const}} = -(d-1)R/(4d)\) (Remark D9.1l). Equals \(-R/6\) iff \(d = 3\).

## §2. What Composition Forces

1. The EXISTENCE of curvature coupling (V_HD ≠ 0 when R ≠ 0)
2. The FORM of curvature coupling (ξ_eff = 1/6 at leading order, universally)
3. The VALUE of V_HD on specific manifolds (determined by geometry, no free parameters)

## §3. What Composition Does NOT Force

1. The metric \(g\) itself (external input; no Einstein equations derived)
2. The value of R (depends on the chosen manifold)
3. Gravity's existence (composition works on flat space with V_HD = 0)

## §4. Three Levels of V_HD = -R/6

| Level | Statement | Scope | Source |
|-------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Local | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) in RNC at \(p\) | Any \((M,g)\), point \(p\) | Standard |
| Semi-global | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) in normal-coordinate patch | Weak curvature, small patch | Expansion |
| **Global** | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) **everywhere** | Lie groups, products of \(S^1\) and \(S^3\) | Thm M0.3 + C5.1 |

The jump from local to global is non-trivial: most manifolds have \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} \neq -R/6\) away from the RNC center.

## §5. The D=4 Coincidence (Physical Content)

Conformal coupling: \(\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} = (D-2)/(4(D-1))\). Equals \(1/6\) iff \(D = 4\).

**In spacetime dimension D=4** (spatial d=3):
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) (composition-forced, universal)
- \(\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} R = R/6\) (conformal invariance condition)
- These are the SAME. Half-density coupling = conformal coupling.

**Physical consequence:** In D=4, the composition-forced scalar couples to curvature conformally. No free parameter \(\xi\) — composition selects \(\xi = 1/6\) uniquely.

**In D ≠ 4:** \(\xi_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1/6 \neq \xi_{\mathrm{conf}}\). Half-density coupling ≠ conformal coupling. An additional \((\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} - 1/6)R\phi^2\) term would be needed for conformal invariance.

## §6. Answer to OQ1a

**Does composition indirectly force curvature coupling?** YES.

The chain: composition (P4.2) → half-density measure → V_HD = -R/6 (at leading order).

**Does this force gravity?** NO.

Composition determines HOW matter couples to a GIVEN curved background. It does not determine WHICH background is realized. The metric is input; the curvature coupling is output.

**Precise statement:**

> Composition is a SELECTION principle for matter-gravity coupling.
> Given \((M,g)\), the coupling \(\xi = 1/6\) is forced (no free parameter).
> The metric \(g\) is not derived from composition.

## §7. Lorentzian Signature

In Hamiltonian path integral on static spacetime:
- Measure at each time slice = \(\prod_k d^d x_k\) (coordinate volume)
- Half-density correction = spatial: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = V_{\mathrm{HD}}(h)\) where \(h_{ij}\) is spatial metric
- Lapse \(N\) enters the action \(S\), not the spatial measure
- All Riemannian witnesses (S², S³, H², Lie groups) give ordering corrections directly

For static de Sitter (\(S^3\) spatial section): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\) (constant, no distortion).

For Schwarzschild: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is position-dependent (spatial R ≠ 0, not constant curvature).

## §8. Connection to Planck Area

If gravity IS present (G available):
- Composition forces \(\hbar\) (P4.2)
- Half-density forces area scale \(L^{d/2}\) in d spatial dimensions
- In D=4 (\(d=3\)): unique area scale from {G,c,ℏ} = \(L_P^2 = G\hbar/c^3\) (Buckingham, THREE-AGENT)
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) with \(R \sim 1/L_P^2\) gives \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} \sim -1/(6L_P^2)\) (Planck-scale correction)

But this is a CONDITIONAL chain: IF gravity exists, THEN Planck area is forced.
Composition alone does not force gravity's existence.

## §9. Summary for Paper

Composition forces curvature coupling \(\xi = 1/6\) universally.
This equals conformal coupling iff \(D = 4\).
The metric is input; the coupling is output.
No Stage 4 ("composition forces gravity") is supported.

These statements are already implicit in the paper (D9.1h-D9.1o + HD-D1.3b).
A concise remark in §9.4 or §10 could make this explicit.

## §10. Universal a_1 = 0 (from mathematician BB5 §10.3)

**Important correction to OQ1a notebook §620:**

The a_1 = 0 observation was listed as a D=4-specific coincidence (iii). But mathematician's BB5 M10.3 shows:

\(a_1(\Delta_{1/2}) = R/6 + V_{\mathrm{HD}} = R/6 - R/6 = 0\)

This holds in ALL dimensions, on ANY Riemannian manifold, because \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) in RNC at every point and \(a_1\) is a local invariant computed in RNC.

**Consequence:** The D=4 coincidence table in OQ1a notebook should be revised:
- (iii) "\(a_1 = 0\)" is NOT specific to D=4. It is universal.
- The genuine D=4 coincidence is ONLY (i) \((\partial\sigma)^2\) cancellation and (ii) \(\xi_{\mathrm{eff}} = \xi_{\mathrm{conf}}\).
- (iii) is a consequence of composition in ALL dimensions, not a dimension-selection criterion.

**Physical meaning:** Composition forces the half-density Laplacian to have no first-order curvature counterterm. This is a universal feature of compositionally correct quantization, not a special D=4 property. The one-loop finiteness of the curvature sector (no \(R\phi^2\) counterterm) is built into the half-density prescription everywhere.

## §11. Lorentzian V_HD: ADM Decomposition (extends D9.1m)

ADM metric: \(ds^2 = -N^2 dt^2 + h_{ij}(dx^i + N^i dt)(dx^j + N^j dt)\).

**Hamiltonian path integral measure:** \(\prod_k d^d x_k\) at each time slice (coordinate volume, not Riemannian volume). Half-density correction involves SPATIAL metric \(h_{ij}\) only:

\[V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{(\text{Lor})} = -h^{1/4}\,\Delta_h\,(h^{-1/4})\]

**Lapse and shift:** \(N, N^i\) enter the action integral
\(S = \int dt\, d^d x\, N\sqrt{h}\,\mathcal{L}\)
but NOT the spatial measure \(\prod d^d x\). No contribution to \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\).

**In spatial RNC:** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{(\text{Lor})} = -{}^{(d)}R/6\) where \({}^{(d)}R\) is the scalar curvature of the spatial section \(({\Sigma_t}, h_{ij})\).

**Gauss-Codazzi:** \({}^{(D)}R = {}^{(d)}R + K^2 - K_{ij}K^{ij} + \text{boundary}\).

Hence: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -{}^{(d)}R/6 = -({}^{(D)}R - K^2 + K_{ij}K^{ij})/6 + \text{boundary}/6\).

**Extrinsic curvature enters only through Gauss-Codazzi**, not through the half-density formula itself.

| Spacetime | Spatial section | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) | \(K_{ij}\) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Minkowski | \(\mathbb{R}^3\) | 0 | 0 |
| Static de Sitter | \(S^3\) | \(-1\) (constant) | 0 |
| Expanding FRW (\(k=+1\)) | \(S^3(a(t))\) | \(-1/a(t)^2\) (time-dep) | \(\dot{a}/a \cdot h_{ij}\) |
| Schwarzschild | non-constant \({}^{(3)}R\) | position-dep | 0 |
| Kerr | non-constant \({}^{(3)}R\) | position-dep | 0 (Boyer-Lindquist \(t\)) |

**Key result:** For static spacetimes (\(K_{ij}=0\)): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{(\text{Lor})} = V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{(\text{Riem})}(\Sigma)\). All existing Riemannian witnesses directly give Lorentzian ordering corrections.

**For non-static** (expanding universe): \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) becomes time-dependent through \(h_{ij}(t)\), but at each instant the formula is the same Riemannian expression applied to the instantaneous spatial geometry.

**4D vs 3D half-density:** The spacetime 4D half-density \(|g_4|^{1/4} = N^{1/2}|h|^{1/4}\) involves the lapse. But the Hamiltonian path integral uses the SPATIAL half-density \(|h|^{1/4}\) at each time slice. The \(N^{1/2}\) factor converts proper time to coordinate time and appears in the action weighting, not in the operator ordering. This distinction resolves D9.1m's open question about Lorentzian signature.

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (physicist). Needs second-agent review.**
