# Padé Approximants and Resummation as Controlled Extrapolation
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S136

## Context
The uncuttable paper's Section 2 develops a "counterterm tower" theme:
- Example 2.1: derivative as renormalized limit
- Remark 2.2: higher-order Taylor subtractions
- Remark 2.3: Euler–Maclaurin correction tower
- Remark 2.4: Richardson extrapolation (Romberg tableau)

All these use polynomial information (Taylor/power series) to systematically
improve approximations. But power series often diverge or converge slowly.
Padé approximants are the natural next step: rational functions [L/M] = P_L/Q_M
that reproduce a given power series to order L+M, often giving access to
analytic structure (poles, branch cuts) invisible in truncated series.

## Key claims

1. **Padé approximant definition.** Given f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x² + ···,
   the [L/M] Padé approximant is the ratio P_L(x)/Q_M(x) of polynomials of
   degree L and M such that the Taylor expansion of P_L/Q_M matches f through
   order x^{L+M}. The coefficients are determined by a linear system (L+M+1
   constraints from matching).

2. **Convergence beyond radius of convergence.** For meromorphic functions, Padé
   approximants can converge outside the disk of convergence of the Taylor
   series: poles of the Padé approximate poles of f, and convergence holds in
   the cut plane (Montessus de Ballore theorem). This is controlled extrapolation:
   the finite data (Taylor coefficients) gives access to the function beyond the
   region where naive truncation works.

3. **Borel–Padé resummation.** For asymptotic (divergent) series, the Borel
   transform B(t) = Σ (c_n/n!) t^n often has finite radius of convergence.
   Applying Padé to B(t) and then Laplace-transforming back gives f(x) =
   ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} [L/M]_B(xt) dt. This "Borel–Padé" method can resum divergent
   perturbation series in QFT and quantum mechanics, extracting finite answers
   from formally divergent expansions.

4. **Connection to uncuttable theme.** The Padé/Borel method is another instance
   of "the limit requires a controlled procedure": a divergent series has no
   naive limit, but a systematic resummation (Borel transform + rational
   approximation + Laplace) extracts the intended quantity. The resummation
   prescription is part of the definition — just as the counterterm subtraction
   in Example 2.1 is part of the definition of the derivative.

## Proposed remark
Remark 2.5 (~3 sentences) after Remark 2.4. Note that Padé approximants extend
the counterterm tower by replacing polynomial approximation with rational
approximation, giving access to analytic structure (poles, cuts) beyond truncated
series, and enabling resummation of divergent series through Borel–Padé — another
instance where "the limit requires a controlled procedure."

### Claim 1: Padé approximant definition
**ERROR.** The blackboard states "matches f through order x^{L+M}" (line 23) but
also claims "L+M+1 constraints from matching" (lines 23-24). This is inconsistent.

**Correction:** The [L/M] Padé approximant P_L(x)/Q_M(x) is defined such that
    f(x)·Q_M(x) - P_L(x) = O(x^{L+M+1})
i.e., the Taylor series match through order x^{L+M} inclusive (orders 0,1,...,L+M),
which gives L+M+1 constraints. Typically one fixes Q_M(0)=1 (normalization), so
the total number of free parameters is L+1+M, exactly matching L+M+1 constraints.
The statement "through order x^{L+M}" is CORRECT; the phrase "order L+M+1" in
line 15 is INCORRECT. The blackboard should say "order L+M", not "L+M+1".

### Claim 2: Montessus de Ballore theorem
**CORRECT.** The Montessus de Ballore theorem (1902) states: if f is meromorphic
in |z| < R with exactly M poles (counted with multiplicity), then the sequence of
diagonal or near-diagonal Padé approximants [L/M] with M fixed converges uniformly
to f in compact subsets of the disk minus the poles, as L→∞. The convergence
extends beyond the radius of convergence of the Taylor series if the only
singularities in the disk are poles (not branch cuts). The description on
lines 26-31 is accurate.

### Claim 3: Borel-Padé resummation
**ERROR (minor but important).** The Borel transform definition on line 34 is
INCORRECT.

**Correction:** For an asymptotic series f(x) ~ Σ c_n x^n with divergent factorial
growth (e.g., c_n ~ n!), the Borel transform is defined as
    B(t) = Σ (c_n / n!) t^n,
NOT "Σ c_n t^n / n!" as written (which is ambiguous). The division by n! is
crucial: if c_n ~ n!, then B(t) has finite radius of convergence. The resummed
function is then
    f(x) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} B(xt) dt.
For Borel-Padé, one approximates B(t) by its [L/M] Padé approximant and computes
    f_{L,M}(x) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-t} [L/M]_B(xt) dt.
The description is conceptually correct but the notation "Σ c_n t^n / n!" should
be clarified as "Σ (c_n/n!) t^n" to avoid ambiguity.

**Additional technical note:** Borel-Padé is most effective when B(t) has isolated
singularities on the positive real axis (e.g., instantons in QFT). The Padé
approximant can approximate the analytic continuation of B(t) around these
singularities, and the Laplace integral defines the lateral resummation. If B(t)
has a branch cut on [0,∞), the method requires careful contour prescription
(Borel-Leroy variants, conformal mapping, etc.).

### Claim 4: Connection to uncuttable theme
**CORRECT & WELL-MOTIVATED.** The analogy is sound: just as the derivative requires
a counterterm subtraction (Example 2.1), divergent series require a resummation
prescription to extract finite physics. The Borel-Padé procedure is a "controlled
extrapolation" — a systematic algorithm that elevates an ill-defined sum into a
well-defined integral via transform + rational approximation + inverse transform.
This fits naturally into the "counterterm tower" narrative of Section 2.

### Other issues
1. **Terminology precision.** The phrase "non-perturbative information" (lines 15,
   50) is common in physics but can be misleading: Padé approximants are still
   rational functions (finite data), so they capture at most a finite number of
   poles/residues. They cannot recover true non-perturbative features like
   essential singularities or infinitely many branch points. More precise: "Padé
   approximants give access to analytic structure (poles, branch cuts) not visible
   in truncated power series."

2. **Montessus vs. general convergence.** Montessus de Ballore covers the case of
   isolated poles. For branch cuts, one typically uses diagonal sequences [N/N] or
   multipoint Padé, and convergence is weaker (logarithmic rate in some cases).
   The blackboard conflates "poles" and "cuts" — only poles are guaranteed by
   Montessus.

3. **Proposed remark scope.** The proposed Remark 2.5 is appropriate for a brief
   mention (3 sentences as noted). To avoid overclaiming, emphasize that Padé is
   "one tool among many" for controlled extrapolation (alongside Richardson,
   Shanks, Wynn epsilon, etc.), and that Borel-Padé is specifically for divergent
   series with factorial growth (not all divergences).

### Summary
- Fix line 15: "order L+M+1" → "order L+M"
- Fix line 34: "Σ c_n t^n / n!" → "Σ (c_n/n!) t^n" (clarify notation)
- Soften "non-perturbative information" to "analytic structure beyond truncation"
- Otherwise, the note is accurate and the connection to the uncuttable theme is
  well-motivated.
