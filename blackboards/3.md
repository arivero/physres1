# Upgrading H6.3: Scale-Channel Witness from Heuristic to Theorem

## 1. The Gap (D10.1c in Cornerstone)

Remark D10.1c identifies three crown witnesses for RCP channels:
- (1) Partition: P4.2 forces ℏ (constructive). ✓
- (2) Representation: D9.1f (self-adjoint extension parameter). ✓
- (3) Scale: H6.3 is a HEURISTIC (not a theorem). ✗

H6.3 says: "local contact-expansion data, combined with analyticity, reconstructs non-perturbative
global structure." This is a demonstration, not a uniqueness proof.

**Goal:** Replace H6.3 with a theorem using RCP-Res-P1.1 (two-model sev-2 result).

## 2. RCP-Res-P1.1 as Scale-Channel Theorem

From notebooks/resurgence-composition-bridge.md §11 (four-agent complete, two models):

**RCP-Res-P1.1 (Instanton Lattice Rigidity Theorem):**
If K_t satisfies the partition composition law (C) and g_R(μ) satisfies the scale channel
RG semigroup (A4, RG-P1.2), then the Borel transform B[K_t] has singularities ONLY at
{n/g_R(μ) : n = 0, 1, 2, ...} and these run RIGIDLY under RG:
∂_{log μ} ζ_n = n · β(g_R)/g_R²

Verified in two models: 2D delta (QM) and CP(1) sigma model (QFT).

## 3. Why This Upgrades H6.3

H6.3's claim: "local data reconstructs non-perturbative global structure."

**RCP-Res-P1.1 makes this precise:**
- "Local data" = the perturbative coefficients a_n in K_t ~ Σ a_n ℏ^n
- "Non-perturbative global structure" = the Borel singularity lattice {n·ζ*}
- "Reconstruction" = the Leibniz rule forcing the FULL lattice from the leading singularity

**The theorem:** Given (a) the Borel transform B[K_t] has a leading singularity at ζ_1 = 1/g_R(μ)
and (b) the composition law (C), the FULL instanton lattice {nζ_1} is forced (not just ζ_1).

This is the scale-channel theorem: composition (C) + RG (A4) → instanton lattice is uniquely
determined by the leading singularity (single-instanton sector).

## 4. Proposed New Derivation D6.4b (Scale Witness)

To replace/strengthen H6.3:

**Derivation D6.4b (Instanton Lattice from Partition + Scale):**
Let K_t be a path integral kernel satisfying:
(C) K_{t₁+t₂} = K_{t₁} ∘ K_{t₂}   [partition sewing law]
(A4) g_R(μ) satisfies μ d/dμ g_R = β(g_R)   [scale RG semigroup]

Then the Borel transform B[K_t] satisfies:
(i) Alien Leibniz rule: Δ_{nA}(K_{t₁+t₂}) = Σ Δ_{jA}(K_{t₁})·Δ_{(n-j)A}(K_{t₂})
(ii) Scale rigidity: the lattice {n·ζ_1} runs rigidly under RG
(iii) Physical observable (energy/mass gap) is μ-independent

Demonstrated in: 2D delta (bound state E_B = -e^{-1/g_R}); CP(1) (mass gap M = μ·e^{-2π/g_R}).

**This IS a theorem (not a heuristic) for the stated class of models.**

## 5. Remaining Gap in H6.3

H6.3 also claims "uniqueness": the reconstruction is unique.
RCP-Res-P1.1 does NOT prove uniqueness — it proves that the partition law FORCES nζ_1 given ζ_1.
But it does NOT prove:
(a) That ζ_1 is uniquely determined by composition alone (it requires additional input: g_R(μ))
(b) That no other singularity structures are compatible with composition

**Honest D6.4b scope:** The theorem proves conditional uniqueness — given the leading singularity,
the full lattice is determined. The leading singularity itself requires separate physical input (coupling).

## 6. Proposed Paper-Edit

**Target:** paper/main.md, Remark D10.1c (line ~1566)

**Replace:** "The third witness (scale channel) is at present a structural heuristic (H6.3)"

**With:** "The third witness (scale channel) is now partially constructive: Derivation D6.4b shows
that the partition composition law (C) forces the full instanton lattice {nζ_*} uniquely from
the leading singularity (RCP-Res-P1.1, verified in the 2D delta model and CP(1) sigma model).
The uniqueness proof is conditional — it determines the RELATIVE positions of multi-instanton
singularities given the leading singularity, but not the leading singularity itself (which requires
additional physical input). H6.3 remains a heuristic for the unconditional reconstruction; D6.4b
provides the conditional theorem."

**Severity:** sev-2 (upgrades a heuristic gap in D10.1c to partial theorem, with honest scope).

## 7. Status

PHYSICIST'S ANALYSIS. See §8 (Critic), §9 (Mathematician) below.

## 8. Critic Assessment
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-20 -->

**Verdict: PARTIALLY SOUND. The upgrade is genuine but more limited than claimed.**

### C1: RCP-Res-P1.1 does upgrade H6.3 — for essential singularities only

H6.3 covers three singularity types: (1) poles (Pade), (2) branch cuts (dispersion),
(3) essential singularities (Borel/instanton). RCP-Res-P1.1 addresses ONLY type (3).

For type (3): RCP-Res-P1.1 proves that composition (C) forces the instanton lattice
{n * zeta_1} from the leading singularity. This IS a genuine conditional theorem,
and the conditionality (§5) is honestly stated.

But H6.3 as written in the cornerstone presents all three types together. The upgrade
only applies to the Borel/instanton part, not to Pade (algebraic) or dispersion (cuts).

### C2: "Derivation D6.4b" label — imprecise

The proposed D6.4b is verified in two SPECIFIC models (2D delta QM + CP(1) QFT),
not proven in full generality. The alien Leibniz rule from composition (C) is general,
but the specific lattice structure zeta_n = n/g_R requires:
- Single-instanton action S_1 = 1/g_R (model-dependent)
- Multiplicative instanton sector decomposition (holds for topological sectors, not all models)

Calling this a "Derivation" (= theorem in our labeling) overstates. It is a
PROPOSITION (= verified in specific models, expected general). Recommendation:
label as "Proposition D6.4b" or "Result D6.4b," not "Derivation."

### C3: Stokes constants not addressed

RCP-Res-P1.1 determines the POSITIONS of Borel singularities (the lattice {n * zeta_1})
but NOT the Stokes constants (residues at each singularity). The Stokes constants encode
the physical content of the non-perturbative sector (e.g., instanton-anti-instanton contributions).

The "uniqueness proof" gap in H6.3 is partly about whether the reconstruction from local
data is unique. For essential singularities: lattice positions are unique (RCP-Res-P1.1),
but Stokes constants require additional input (not forced by composition alone).

### C4: Proposed paper-edit — well-calibrated with one fix

The proposed replacement text (§6) is honest about conditionality and scope.
One amendment needed: replace "Derivation D6.4b" with "Proposition D6.4b"
throughout, to match the verification-in-models status (not a general theorem).

### Verdict

**Approve for promotion as Proposition (not Derivation).**

The upgrade genuinely narrows the H6.3 gap: the scale-channel witness goes from
"structural heuristic" to "conditional proposition verified in two models."
This is a real improvement. But the gap is narrowed, not closed:
- Positions of Borel singularities: DETERMINED (by RCP-Res-P1.1)
- Stokes constants: NOT DETERMINED (require additional input)
- Poles and cuts (types 1-2 of H6.3): NOT ADDRESSED by this upgrade

**Sev-2 confirmed.** Paper-edit can proceed with the Proposition label correction.

TWO-AGENT for BB3: Physicist (§1-7) + Critic (§8). Awaiting mathematician for three-agent.

## 9. Mathematician's Assessment
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-20 -->

### M9.1: Is D6.4b a theorem?

**Claims (i)-(iii) status:**

(i) Alien Leibniz rule: THEOREM. Follows from Borel convolution semigroup structure (Écalle 1981, §4 of resurgence notebook). No gap. Standard prior art, here applied to P4.2.

(ii) Scale rigidity ∂_{log μ} ζ_n = n · β(g_R)/g_R²: TAUTOLOGY. Since ζ_n = n/g_R(μ), this is the chain rule. Zero mathematical content beyond the definition.

(iii) μ-independence of observables: THEOREM (given model setup). Standard cancellation: ∂_μ[μ · e^{-2π/g_R(μ)}] = 0 by chain rule. Not new; two explicit verifications add credibility.

**Critical structural issue (Borel singularity type):**

Claim §3: "FULL instanton lattice {nζ_1} is FORCED."

Precise scope: The Borel convolution of a function with a simple pole at ζ_1 produces a function with a simple pole at ζ_1 and a double pole at 2ζ_1 (convolution of two simple poles). The POSITION 2ζ_1 is forced; the CHARACTER changes (double pole ≠ simple pole). For n-fold convolution: position nζ_1 forced; character = n-th order pole (or logarithm if resonant).

This is correct for POSITIONS. The physicist's §3 statement "FULL instanton lattice {nζ_1} is forced" is TRUE for singularity POSITIONS. Accurate as stated.

**Agreement with Critic §8, C1:**
RCP-Res-P1.1 covers Borel/essential singularity type only. Poles (Padé) and cuts (dispersion) in H6.3 are NOT addressed. Correct.

**Agreement with Critic §8, C2:**
"Derivation D6.4b" label is too strong for two-model verification. "Proposition" is correct.

### M9.2: Conditionality check

§5(a) "ζ_1 requires additional input g_R(μ)": CORRECT.
§5(b) "no other singularity structures compatible with composition": INCORRECT.

Any semigroup-valued singularity set is compatible with composition (e.g., {n·ζ_1 + m·ζ_2 : n,m ≥ 0} for two-instanton-type models). The composition law forces a COMMUTATIVE ADDITIVE SEMIGROUP structure on positions; the integer lattice {nζ_1} is the rank-1 case.

**Required fix (M-F1):** Replace §5(b) with:
"(b) That no other singularity structures are compatible with composition: composition forces an ADDITIVE SEMIGROUP on Borel singularity positions; {nζ_1} is the rank-1 case (one instanton scale). Two-scale models would have rank-2 lattices."

### M9.3: Net Assessment

D6.4b is a VALID PROPOSITION (not a Derivation), subject to:
- Proposition label (not Derivation): Critic C2, Mathematician concurs
- Simple-pole assumption made explicit
- §5(b) corrected per M-F1
- Scope restricted to Borel/instanton type (not Padé or dispersion)

The upgrade from H6.3 "demonstration" → "conditional proposition verified in two models" is GENUINE. The mathematician endorses the upgrade with the above corrections.

### M9.4: Final fixes for paper-edit (§6)

Three fixes to §6 proposed text:
- **M-F1** (§5b): additive semigroup framing, not "no other structures"
- **M-F2** (§6 text): "Derivation D6.4b" → "Proposition D6.4b" (matches C2)
- **M-F3** (§6 text): add "(simple-pole Borel singularity type)" to scope clause

**THREE-AGENT COMPLETE:** Physicist (§1-7) + Critic (§8) + Mathematician (§9).
Sev-2 confirmed. Paper-edit can proceed with fixes M-F1, M-F2, M-F3 applied.
