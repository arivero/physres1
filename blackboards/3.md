# Efimov Limit Cycle and PSL(2,ℝ) Scale Channel

## 1. Efimov Physics Verification

**P1. Transcendental equation s₀:**
s·cosh(πs/2) = (8/√3)·sinh(πs/6)  →  s₀ = 1.006238 ✓
Geometric ratio: e^{π/s₀} = 22.694 ✓ (Efimov 1970, Bedaque-Hammer-Van Kolck 1999)

**P2. Derivation of discrete scale invariance:**
STM equation (Skornyakov-Ter-Martirosyan) at unitarity (a→∞):
T_3(k;k') = λ_3 + (2/π)∫_0^Λ dq q² [1/(q²−k²) + ...] · (−1/(|k'+q|))
Kernel K(k,k') has property K(e^{π/s₀}k, e^{π/s₀}k') = K(k,k')
→ discrete scale invariance (Danilov-Migdal-Efimov DSI)

**P3. Limit cycle:**
λ_3(Λ·e^{π/s₀}) = λ_3(Λ)  (log-periodic, not monotone)
Physical: bound state tower E_n ~ e^{-2πn/s₀} · E_0  (ratio e^{2π/s₀} ≈ 515) ✓

**P4. Effective range corrections:**
At finite a: DSI broken. Three-body parameter κ_* is universal at unitarity.
RG limit cycle picture: Bedaque-Hammer-Van Kolck (1999) NPB 552.

## 2. RCP Scale Channel: Is the Framing Correct?

**Computationalist claim:** "Composition forces scale structure" via 3-body composition.

**Physicist assessment: PARTIALLY CORRECT. Precision needed.**

3-body composition = 3-body Lippmann-Schwinger (spectator + rescattering):
T_3 = V_3 + T_2 * G_0 * T_3  (composition in T-matrix sense)

The forcing chain:
(i) 2-body unitarity: T_2 → −1/(ik) (maximal unitarity at |a|→∞)
(ii) 3-body LS: T_3 = T_2 * G_0 * T_3  (iteration = composition of 2-body T)
(iii) UV renormalization: λ_3(Λ) must absorb logarithmic divergence
(iv) DSI of kernel: forces log-periodicity of λ_3(Λ)

CAVEAT: The forcing here is (unitarity) + (LS composition) + (UV renorm) → limit cycle.
NOT merely composition alone. The 2-body unitarity condition (a→∞) is essential.
Compare: in 2D delta case, composition + cutoff-independence alone forces the beta function.
In Efimov case, unitarity (a→∞) is an additional input, not just composition.

The remark should say: "3-body composition at unitarity + UV renormalizability forces..."
NOT: "composition alone forces..."

## 3. PSL(2,ℝ) Möbius Structure (arXiv:2509.04746)

**Computationalist claim:** RG step = Möbius transformation in PSL(2,ℝ).

**Physicist assessment: CORRECT (modulo qualification).**

Möbius transformation on coupling space:
f: λ_3 → (aλ_3 + b)/(cλ_3 + d), a,b,c,d ∈ ℝ, ad−bc=1

Composition of two RG steps = composition of Möbius maps ✓ (group law in PSL(2,ℝ))
Limit cycle = orbit of a HYPERBOLIC Möbius map (|tr| > 2: two real fixed points)
  →  λ_3 → e^{2α}λ_3 (near repulsive FP) / → e^{-2α}λ_3 (near attractive FP)
  Period: α = π/s₀ (Efimov scale)

TG-Q2 connection: Is PSL(2,ℝ) action a groupoid?
- PSL(2,ℝ) acts on ℝP¹ (projective coupling space) — a transformation groupoid
- Objects: points in ℝP¹ (coupling values)
- Morphisms: PSL(2,ℝ) elements (RG steps)
- Composition: group multiplication = iterated RG step
- This IS a groupoid (trivially, as a group action groupoid)
- But it is a FULL groupoid (all morphisms composable) — not the "partial" structure of pair groupoid

**Key distinction from partition channel:**
Partition channel: pair groupoid M×M (source/target maps give structured partial composition)
Scale channel via Möbius: FULL group PSL(2,ℝ) (every element composable with every other)
These are different groupoid structures. Not trivially the "same" groupoid.

## 4. Implication for TG-Q2

TG-Q2: Is there a master groupoid unifying all three RCP channels?

Provisional physicist answer: THREE DISTINCT GROUPOID STRUCTURES

| Channel | Groupoid | Composition law |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Partition | Pair groupoid M×M | Convolution (condition: source=target) |
| Scale | PSL(2,ℝ) action groupoid on ℝP¹ | Möbius composition (unconditioned) |
| Momentum | ? (unclear) | ? |

The three channels have DIFFERENT composition structures — a "master groupoid" would need to be
a groupoid containing all three as quotients or sub-groupoids. This is non-trivial.
Alternatively: they are each "RCP forces a groupoid structure" — the pattern, not a single object.

## 5. Summary for Proposal Review

**Endorsement:** Efimov limit cycle is a genuine new scale-channel witness. Physical content verified.

**Required precision:** "3-body composition at unitarity" not "3-body composition alone."

**PSL(2,ℝ) claim:** Correct as stated; hyperbolic Möbius structure confirmed.

**TG-Q2 caution:** PSL(2,ℝ) ≠ pair groupoid. Different categorical structures. See §4.

**Recommended paper home:** rcp-foundations §5 (after Example 5.2), as Remark 5.5-Efimov.
NOT fermionic-mediators (the connection there is tangential).

**TWO-AGENT: computationalist (proposal) + physicist (§§1-5).**
Needs mathematician as third agent (groupoid distinction in §§3-4).
