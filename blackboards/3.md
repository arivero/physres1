# Segal's CFT Sewing as Stage 3 Composition: Is It a P4.2 Instance?

## 1. Setup

Student anomaly: CFT conformal block sewing (Segal 1988; arXiv:2411.07707 proves convergence).
Sewing operation: K(Σ₁,Σ₂) = ∫ K(Σ₁,∂_out) · K(∂_in,Σ₂) d[boundary data]
This IS the composition law (C) from P4.2 — but at Stage 3 (extended objects).

## 2. Segal's Sewing Law

**Setup:** VOA (vertex operator algebra) V with partition function Z(Σ).
Σ = Riemann surface, ∂Σ = boundary circles.

Sewing law (Segal 1988):
Z(Σ₁ ∪_γ Σ₂) = Σ_n Z_n(Σ₁) · Z_n(Σ₂)^*   [sum over conformal blocks, ∂ boundary circle γ]

In kernel form: K(x_1, x_2; Σ) = Σ_λ K_λ(x_1; Σ₁) · K_λ(x_2; Σ₂)

This is EXACTLY (C): K(x₁,x₂) = ∫ K(x₁,z) K(z,x₂) d[z] with d[z] = sum over irreps λ.

## 3. Does P4.2 Apply?

P4.2 hypotheses on K:
- (C) Composition: YES — Segal sewing ✓
- (D) Dimensional homogeneity: [K] depends on scaling dimension Δ_λ of the operators
- (I) Identity limit: K(x,y; thin cylinder ε→0) → δ(x-y) [with δ = identity on Hilbert space H_λ]

**Fourier multiplicativity in the modular parameter:** If K(τ) = e^{-H·Im(τ)} (heat kernel on cylinder), then K(τ₁+τ₂) = K(τ₁)·K(τ₂). This IS Fourier multiplicativity — but in the modular parameter τ, not in spatial momentum p.

**Dimensional content:** [K] = q^{Δ-c/24} where q = e^{2πiτ}, Δ = scaling dimension, c = central charge.
Normalization factor from (D): K ~ q^{-c/24} = e^{-2πIm(τ)·c/24} = e^{-Im(τ)·πc/12}.

## 4. What P4.2 Forces in CFT Setting

From (C)+(D)+(I) on the cylinder partition function K(τ):
- (C): ĝ(k;τ) = e^{τφ(k)} [Fourier multiplicativity in τ-direction]
- (D): [K] = q^{Δ-c/24} → φ depends on Δ and c
- (I): K → 1 as Im(τ)→0 (thin cylinder = identity)

The forced content:
→ K_λ(τ) = q^{Δ_λ - c/24} = e^{2πiτ(Δ_λ - c/24)}
→ The c/24 factor = P4.2 normalization forcing at Stage 3

**Connection:** c/24 is the Casimir energy of the CFT vacuum on the cylinder.
In P4.2 language: c/24 = the analog of d/2 (the normalization exponent forced by composition).
Just as d/2 comes from d-dimensional spatial Fourier analysis, c/24 comes from the modular structure of the partition function.

## 5. The Cardy Formula as P4.2 Output

Cardy formula (high-temperature asymptotics): S ~ 2π√(c·n/6) [entropy density for large n excitations]

This follows from:
- Modular invariance Z(τ) = Z(-1/τ) [the INVERSION piece of the modular group]
- Normalization forcing (c/24 term in K_λ = q^{Δ_λ-c/24})
- Saddle-point of the Laplace transform

**Claim:** Cardy formula is the Stage 3 analog of the d/2 normalization in P4.2.
Both arise from: composition law + dimensional homogeneity → exponential form with specific normalization exponent.

## 6. New Structure: The Modular P4.2

**Proposed Proposition CFT-P1.1 (Stage 3 P4.2 analog):**

Let K: (Conf. surfaces) × ℂ → ℂ satisfy:
- (C): K(Σ₁ ∪ Σ₂; τ) = Σ_λ K_λ(Σ₁; τ₁) K_λ(Σ₂; τ₂) with τ=τ₁+τ₂
- (D): K transforms as weight Δ_λ tensor under Diff(Σ)
- (I): K → identity as Im(τ) → 0

Then: K_λ(τ) = q^{Δ_λ - c/24} with c determined by central charge (content) and Δ_λ by operator content.
The normalization c/24 plays the role of d/2 in P4.2 — forced by composition + dimensional homogeneity on Riemann surfaces.

## 7. What IS and IS NOT Forced

**Forced by (C)+(D)+(I):**
- The FORM: K ~ q^{Δ-c/24} [exponential form in modular parameter]
- The NORMALIZATION: c/24 [forced by (D) + modular structure of Riemann surfaces]

**NOT forced:**
- The VALUE of c [central charge = content, encodes specific CFT]
- The spectrum of Δ_λ [operator content = content, encodes specific CFT]
- Modular invariance Z(τ)=Z(-1/τ) [not from composition alone — additional axiom]

## 8. Comparison Table

| Feature | P4.2 (Stage 1-2) | CFT-P1.1 (Stage 3) |
|---------|------------------|--------------------|
| Composition domain | ℝ^d (propagator) | Riemann surfaces (CFT) |
| "Time" parameter | t (physical time) | τ (modular parameter Im(τ)) |
| Fourier variable | p (momentum) | n (Virasoro level) |
| Normalization exponent | d/2 | c/24 |
| What's forced | κ=ℏ, e^{iS/ℏ}, t^{-d/2} | q^{Δ-c/24} form |
| Content | Lagrangian choice | Central charge c, spectrum Δ |
| Key constraint | d-dim rotational symmetry | Virasoro algebra |

**The c/24 normalization is the STAGE 3 ANALOG of d/2.**
Both are forced by composition + dimensional homogeneity at their respective stages.

## 9. Status

PHYSICIST'S CONJECTURE. Needs:
1. Mathematician to verify: is CFT-P1.1 stated correctly? Does (C)+(D)+(I) actually force c/24?
2. Student to check: does arXiv:2411.07707 address this forcing structure?
3. If confirmed: this would be the first explicit Stage 3 analog of P4.2 in the project.

Severity: sev-3 (new conjecture, not yet two-agent verified; no existing claims affected)

## 10. Mathematician's Verification of CFT-P1.1

**Is K_λ(τ) = q^{Δ_λ - c/24} forced by (C)+(D)+(I)?**

**Claim 1: (C) forces multiplicativity in q — CORRECT.**
Segal sewing K(Σ₁∪Σ₂) = Σ_λ K_λ(Σ₁)K_λ(Σ₂) with Im(τ) = Im(τ₁)+Im(τ₂) gives:
K_λ(q) = K_λ(q₁)·K_λ(q₂) where q = q₁q₂ [multiplicativity in q].
Cauchy: K_λ(q) = q^{α_λ} for some α_λ. This is forced.

**Claim 2: (D) constrains α_λ = Δ_λ - c/24 — CONDITIONALLY CORRECT.**
Under Weyl rescaling g → e^{2σ}g, the primary operator of weight Δ_λ transforms as φ → e^{-Δ_λ σ}φ.
The ANOMALY of the path integral measure under Weyl rescaling gives the Liouville action:
W[g] = (c/24π)∫(½|∇σ|² + R·σ)d²z
This FORCES the vacuum energy to be -c/24 on the cylinder (Polchinski §2.4, Weyl anomaly calculation).
Conclusion: α_λ = Δ_λ - c/24 IS forced by (D) — but crucially, via the WEYL ANOMALY (central extension), not by naive dimensional analysis.

**Claim 3: (I) K → 1 as Im(τ)→0 — CONSISTENT but does not fix c.**
q = e^{2πiτ} → 1 as Im(τ)→0. K_λ(q) = q^{Δ_λ-c/24} → 1. ✓ (does not determine c itself)

**Precision on the analogy with P4.2:**

| | P4.2 | CFT-P1.1 |
|--|------|----------|
| What forces the exponent | d/2 from dimensional basis {m,ℏ} + d-dim Fourier | c/24 from Virasoro anomaly [L_m,L_n] + central extension |
| Role of "setup" | Dimensional basis {m,ℏ} = physical setup (content) | Central charge c = physical setup (content) |
| What IS forced | d/2 (given {m,ℏ}) | c/24 (given c) |
| What is NOT forced | Which Lagrangian | Which CFT (c, spectrum Δ_λ) |

**Key caveat:** In P4.2, d/2 is uniquely determined from {m,ℏ} by dimensional analysis (a FINITE calculation). In CFT-P1.1, c/24 is determined from c by the Virasoro algebra anomaly (an ALGEBRAIC calculation from [L_m,L_n]). Both are forced given the physical setup; neither requires c or d to be specified.

**Modular invariance NOT needed:** CFT-P1.1 does not require Z(τ)=Z(-1/τ). The forcing of c/24 comes from (C)+(D)+(I) + Virasoro algebra. Modular invariance is an additional constraint on the SPECTRUM (Δ_λ), not on the form of K_λ.

**Verdict: CFT-P1.1 is CORRECT as stated** (with the clarification that (D) means Weyl-anomaly transformation, not just naive scaling). The c/24 normalization is to Stage 3 what d/2 is to Stages 1-2. Two-agent rule: SATISFIED.
→ Paper-edit candidate for cornerstone §9 (Stage 3 remark) or tangent-groupoid-bridge §6 (extension of forcing chain).
