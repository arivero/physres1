# Blackboard 3 — Central-Force Threshold Bridge Branchboard
Date: 2026-02-14
Track: S270-S278 + D18-D22 (active)

## Why this board exists
Consolidate the threshold-bridge thread into one scratch slot with selectable subbranches.
This board is the blackboard layer for the current multi-topic S/D setup.

## Core bridge statement (current)
For power-law attraction and fixed angular momentum,
\[
q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1
\]
as an asymptotic exponent comparator, with explicit caveats.

## Branch menu (choose any)
1. **S275 branch (compression/caveats):**
   - Candidate D2 compressed wording exists.
   - Caveat coverage checklist in place.
2. **S276 branch (marginal map geometry):**
   - Unique threshold requires monotonicity + range coverage of \(A(L)\).
   - Non-monotone \(A(L)\) gives multiple crossings.
3. **S277 branch (kinetic-window validity):**
   - Numeric and analytic windows for \(\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}\) in relativistic interpolation.
4. **S278 branch (potential-drift diagnostics):**
   - Drift diagnostic \(\Delta m(r)\) for log and \(r^\beta\)-type corrections.

## Current robust caveats
- Use bridge only as asymptotic comparator.
- Keep mechanism separation explicit (threshold mechanism vs inverse-square dimensional identity).
- At marginal exponent, coefficients matter.
- If kinetic/potential effective exponents run significantly over the operating window, do not apply fixed-exponent threshold blindly.

## Candidate promotion gate (from D21)
Open readability C-cycle only if:
1. compression gain >= 40%,
2. caveat checklist passes,
3. no new technical claims are introduced.

Current metric snapshot:
- D2 candidate is ~60% shorter than current remark body.

## Parking lot
- D22 candidate cross-link to Section 9 exists but is currently deferred.

## Session rule addendum (2026-02-14)
- From this point onward in this thread:
  - S/D work goes to blackboards + notebooks.
  - No new S/D updates in `paper/notes/`.

## Latest branch updates (post-rule)
1. **S277 analytic closure:**
   \(\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}(x)=1+1/\sqrt{1+x^2}\), with exact tolerance windows.
2. **S278 portability check:**
   Drift diagnostic also works for \(U=-r^{-m}(1+\alpha r^\beta)\), not only logarithmic corrections.
3. **S276 range condition:**
   Unique threshold requires monotonicity plus range coverage \(A(L_{\min})<B<A(L_{\max})\).

## S275 Iteration 5 addendum (2026-02-14, formula-explicit compression stress test)

### Candidate set and caveat matrix
Compared four variants (`current`, `D2`, `D4`, `D4plus`) with an 8-item checklist:
1. fixed-`L`
2. small-`r`
3. asymptotic scope
4. explicit `qcrit=nu+1`
5. mechanism separation from inverse-square dimensional identity
6. marginal coefficient caveat
7. Newton/SR `3->2` bridge
8. explicit non-classification caveat (`not a full orbit theorem`)

Snapshot:
- `current`: 91 words, coverage `6/8`
- `D2`: 34 words, coverage `7/8` (misses explicit small-`r`)
- `D4`: 25 words, coverage `7/8` (misses explicit non-classification caveat)
- `D4plus`: 31 words, coverage `8/8`

### Recommended wording (readability-first, caveat-complete)
`D4plus`:
"Fixed-L, small-r asymptotics p~L/r imply qcrit=nu+1, yielding Newton/SR 3->2. This bridge is separate from inverse-square dimensional identity; at marginality coefficients decide sign, so it is not a full orbit theorem."

Compression versus current remark body (91 words):
- `D2`: `62.64%`
- `D4plus`: `72.53%`

Decision: if a readability-only `C300` is opened, prefer `D4plus` over `D2` as the default two-sentence replacement candidate.

## Correction addendum (2026-02-14, metric fix)
The previously logged `D4plus` compression value `72.53%` was a carryover from the 25-word `D4` variant. For `D4plus` at 31 words against a 91-word baseline, the correct reduction is:
- `D4plus`: `65.93%`

`D2` remains `62.64%`.

## S276 Iteration 3 addendum (2026-02-14, operating-window uniqueness)

### New compact criterion
Even when global `A(L)` is non-monotone, threshold uniqueness can still hold on the physical operating window.
Use a **windowed criterion** on `L in [L1,L2]`:
1. `A(L)` monotone on `[L1,L2]`, and
2. `B` lies in the window range `[A(L1), A(L2)]`.
Then the crossing on that window is unique.

### Command-backed witness
Toy family:
`A(L) = 0.06 L^2 + 0.8 sin(3L)/L`
with `B=1.5` and window `[4.5,8.0]`.

Observed:
- global crossings on `[0.4,8.0]`: `2`
- window monotone: `True`
- window crossings on `[4.5,8.0]`: `1`
- window range: `(1.3579, 3.7494)`

Range-bracketing check:
- same window with `B=4.5` gives `0` crossings.

Interpretation: global multi-branch behavior does not force local ambiguity once the physically relevant `L` window is fixed.

## D22 Iteration 3 addendum (2026-02-14, bounded cross-link gate)

To avoid forced architecture coupling, cross-link candidates are now screened by a lightweight navigation gate:
1. <=35 words,
2. <=2 sentences,
3. lexical novelty ratio against Section 9.1 local context in `[0.25, 0.45]`.

Current candidate verdicts:
- `X1` (36 words, novelty 0.639): reject (too heavy/new-topic load).
- `X2` (31 words, novelty 0.355): pass.

`X2` text:
"Remark P1.1a in Section 3 is a local exponent-comparator witness for the partition track and does not define a fourth compatibility track. Read it as one example node under Remark P7.1a."

Status: keep parked; promote only inside a dedicated Section 9 readability/navigation C-cycle.

## S277 Iteration 3 addendum (2026-02-14, decade-drift criterion)

For mixed-regime analyses, evaluate exponent drift over a one-decade momentum window:
\[
\Delta\nu_{10}(x)=\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}(x)-\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}(10x),\qquad \nu_{\mathrm{eff}}(x)=1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
\]

Numeric witness:
- `[10^{-3},10^{-2}]`: drift `4.9e-5`
- `[10^{-2},10^{-1}]`: drift `4.9e-3`
- `[10^{-1},1]`: drift `2.88e-1`
- `[1,10]`: drift `6.08e-1`
- `[10,100]`: drift `8.95e-2`
- `[100,1000]`: drift `9.0e-3`

Interpretation: fixed-exponent approximation is stable only in deep NR (`x<<1`) or deep UR (`x>>1`) windows; crossover decades are intrinsically mixed.

Tolerance windows (`Delta nu_10 <= delta`):
- `delta=0.05`: `x<=0.033` or `x>=18`
- `delta=0.10`: `x<=0.049` or `x>=8.95`
- `delta=0.20`: `x<=0.076` or `x>=4.38`

## S278 Iteration 3 addendum (2026-02-14, windowed drift gate)

Define a windowed safety gate for fixed-`q` threshold usage:
\[
\Delta m_{\max}(W)=\max_{r\in W}\Delta m(r),\qquad W=[r_{\min},r_{\max}].
\]
Treat fixed-`q` threshold talk as safe only when `Delta m_max(W) <= eta` (e.g. `eta=0.1`).

Command-backed snapshot (`eta=0.1`):
- Log family corrections need deep windows (`[1e-4,1e-8]`) to pass for modest `alpha`.
- Power-family corrections pass much earlier (often `[1e-2,1e-4]`, sometimes `[1e-1,1e-3]` depending on `alpha,beta`).

Interpretation: same "small drift" gate works across families, but the safe operating window can differ by orders of magnitude.

## D21 Iteration 4 addendum (2026-02-14, integrated launch matrix)

Integrated readiness after S275/S276/S277/S278 + D22 updates:
- Candidate sentence quality gate: pass (`D4plus`, 8/8 caveat coverage).
- Geometric scope caveat available: pass (windowed uniqueness from S276).
- Kinetic regime gate available: pass (decade-drift from S277).
- Potential regime gate available: pass (windowed `Delta m_max` from S278).
- Cross-link requirement: not required for readability-only C300.
- Correctness defect: none.

Result: mandatory readiness passes, but launch remains deferred unless readability is explicitly prioritized.

## S275 Iteration 6 addendum (2026-02-14, TeX-style promotion readiness)

Objective: keep compressed wording but align to manuscript notation conventions.

Candidate comparison (against 91-word baseline):
- `D4plus_ascii`: 36 words, coverage `7/8`, compression `60.44%`
- `D5_tex`: 44 words, coverage `7/8`, compression `51.65%`
- `D6_tex_compact`: 40 words, coverage `8/8`, compression `56.04%`

Preferred TeX-ready wording (`D6_tex_compact`):
"Fixed \(L\), small-\(r\) asymptotics \(p\sim L/r\) give \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\), hence Newton/SR \(3\to2\). This is separate from inverse-square dimensional identity; at marginality coefficients set sign, so it is not a full orbit theorem."

Decision update:
- If `C300` opens, use `D6_tex_compact` as default manuscript candidate (notation-compatible and caveat-complete).

## S277 Iteration 4 addendum (2026-02-14, scale-factor drift law)

Generalize decade drift to a scale factor `b>1`:
\[
\Delta\nu_b(x)=\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}(x)-\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}(bx),\qquad
\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}(x)=1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
\]

### New analytic structure
1. **Peak drift location** (closed form):
\[
x_{\mathrm{peak}}^2=b^{-2/3}+b^{-4/3}.
\]
2. **Asymptotic safe-window estimates** for tolerance `\Delta\nu_b\le\delta`:
   - low-`x`: \(x\lesssim\sqrt{\frac{2\delta}{b^2-1}}\)
   - high-`x`: \(x\gtrsim\frac{1-1/b}{\delta}\)

### Numeric validation highlights
For `b=10`:
- `delta=0.10`: exact safe windows `x<=0.048764` or `x>=8.9382`.
- asymptotic estimates: `x<=0.044947` or `x>=9.0`.
- relative error: low-side `-7.83%`, high-side `+0.69%`.

Peak-drift checks:
- `b=2`:  `x_peak≈1.0133`, `Delta nu_peak≈0.2599`
- `b=5`:  `x_peak≈0.6775`, `Delta nu_peak≈0.5448`
- `b=10`: `x_peak≈0.5117`, `Delta nu_peak≈0.6984`

Interpretation: widening the scale jump (`b`) strengthens maximal mixed-regime drift and shrinks the low-`x` safe window.
