# Critique: relativistic-central-orbits satellite

## Severity-2: None found.

## Severity-3 (minor)

**S3.1 Remark density is high relative to new content**
- 15 remarks in 296 lines (~1 per 20 lines after removing standard derivations)
- Sections 4.3a-g are a chain of 7 remarks annotating standard Schwarzschild results
- Each remark is correct but the cumulative effect is a commentary on textbook material

**S3.2 "Refinement witness" framing is thin**
- Section 1 promises "refinement arguments made explicit" but the paper is SR/GR orbit mechanics
- Connection to cornerstone composition/partition/representation channels is limited to:
  (a) Remark 3.1a: "SR refines Newtonian mechanics" (true but generic)
  (b) Section 6 outlook item 2: "connect more explicitly" (deferred)
- The paper would read identically without the word "refinement"

**S3.3 Section 6 outlook is all deferred**
- Three extensions listed, none attempted
- Item 2 (connect to RCP spine) is the one that would justify the satellite's place in the project

**S3.4 q_crit = nu + 1 rule (Remark 3.1c) is the most original observation**
- Compact, correct, and not standard textbook content
- Could be the lead result rather than buried in a remark

## Severity-4 (style)

**S4.1 Marginal case L = K/c (line 80)**
- "W_L increases monotonically from 0 to mc^2" — should verify: W_L(r) = sqrt(m^2c^4 + K^2c^2/(c^2 r^2)) - K/r = sqrt(m^2c^4 + K^2/r^2) - K/r. As r -> 0: leading terms K/r - K/r = 0 plus subleading mc^2 term. As r -> inf: mc^2. Monotonic increase from 0 to mc^2 is stated; this is correct but the paper doesn't show the intermediate calculation.

**S4.2 Reference list is minimal (4 refs)**
- Missing standard references: Goldstein (classical mechanics textbook), Weinberg (gravitation), MTW
- Sommerfeld 1916 is appropriate and well-connected

## Algebra checks — all correct

- SR force balance: F = gamma m v^2/r (transverse acceleration) ✓
- v = K/L for q=2: direct ratio of K = gamma m v^2 r and L = gamma m r v ✓
- Effective potential W_L(r) = sqrt(m^2c^4 + L^2c^2/r^2) - K/r ✓
- Well depth W_min = mc^2 sqrt(1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2)) ✓
- Orbit equation: omega^2 = 1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2), Binet form with precessing conic ✓
- Precession: Delta phi ≈ pi K^2/(c^2 L^2) to leading order ✓
- SR/GR precession ratio = 1/6 ✓
- q_crit = nu + 1 scaling rule ✓
- Schwarzschild V_eff, V'_eff, V''_eff: all derivatives correct ✓
- L^2(r) = Mr^2/(r - 3M) for circular orbits ✓
- E^2(r) = (r - 2M)^2/(r(r - 3M)) for circular orbits ✓
- V''_eff = 2M(r - 6M)/(r^3(r - 3M)): verified by substitution ✓
- ISCO: r = 6M, L = 2sqrt(3) M, E = 2sqrt(2)/3 ✓
- Stability criterion: 1 + (2 - q)gamma^2 > 0 ✓
- Coordinate Kepler law: omega_phi^2 = M/r_0^3 exact ✓
- Epicyclic ratio: omega_r^2/omega_phi^2 = 3 - q - v^2/c^2 ✓
- Apsidal advance: Delta phi = 2pi(sqrt(r_0/(r_0 - 6M)) - 1) ✓

## Positive assessment

- All algebra is correct — no errors found in any formula
- q_crit = nu + 1 (Remark 3.1c) is a clean, compact, and somewhat original observation
- Stability-precession duality at q = 2 (Remark 5.2c: gamma^2 omega^2 = 1) is a nice structural point
- The Newtonian limit is carefully tracked throughout
- Overclaiming pattern is absent — paper states "not to replace standard treatments" (line 6)
- Sommerfeld connection (Remark 3.2b) correctly links classical orbit equation to fine structure

## Verdict

No errors. Mathematically clean, standard material correctly presented. The paper is essentially a textbook-level derivation collection (SR Kepler, Schwarzschild geodesics) with a thin "refinement" overlay. Its strongest original contributions are the q_crit = nu + 1 rule and the stability-precession duality. Fourth-cleanest paper in the project (after planck-area, half-density-qft, delta-objects).
