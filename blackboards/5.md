# Critique: rg-fundamental satellite

## Severity-2 (significant gaps)

**S2.1 "RG is definitional" overclaims (RG-H1.17, line 703)**
- Claim: RG is "a structural requirement for any definition of a continuum theory via composition of local pieces"
- Reality: The calculus micro-model (Section 3) shows some limit procedures require subtraction; does not prove RG invariance is the unique or correct compatibility condition
- The analogy (derivative = counterterm subtraction) is evocative but not a derivation
- Cross-paper overclaiming pattern: "evocative analogy" presented as "structural requirement"
- Fix: "RG invariance can be *read as* a compatibility condition" (not "is the compatibility condition")

**S2.2 Two-layer QFT claim imprecise (RG-H1.18, line 710)**
- Claim: "Layer 1 constrains structure, Layer 2 constrains content" with "logically independent" layers
- Reality: Layer 1 (per-mode quantization) already depends on the interaction (potential in the Hamiltonian); Layer 2 (assembly/renormalization) constrains admissible interactions
- Logical independence is stated without proof
- Fix: State the two-layer decomposition as a *heuristic organizational principle*, not a theorem

**S2.3 Crown witness overclaim repeats rcp-foundations error (RG-H1.16, line 696)**
- Noether's theorem as "partition crown witness" — Noether follows from action + symmetry, not composition
- Same issue flagged in rcp-foundations review (Task #19, S2.1)
- The ordering and scale witnesses are sound

## Severity-3 (minor)

**S3.1 Hopf-algebra content is descriptive only (Section 4.3)**
- Coproduct formulas for trees of order 1-3: correct
- RG-H1.13 ("coproduct encodes counterterm recursion"): stated at slogan level
- No actual counterterm computed via Hopf algebra in this paper
- Content deferred to companion [RootedTreeBookkeeping]

**S3.2 Self-citation in 1D contact section (Section 5.8.2)**
- [BoyaRivero1994Contact] is the author's own work
- Citation is appropriate and relevant
- The U(2) family result is standard (anchored independently via [BonneauFarautValent2001SAE], [TsutsuiFulopCheon2002Connection])

**S3.3 Gaussian coarse-graining (Section 6) is textbook**
- Schur complement / Gaussian elimination: standard Wilsonian treatment
- RG-D1.7 through RG-H1.8: correct but not novel
- Presented as insight ("makes semigroup structure visible") when it is the standard construction

**S3.4 Robin boundary derivations elementary (RG-D1.6a/b)**
- Quantization condition $\tan(kL) = -k/\lambda$: textbook QM
- Reframing as "RG fixed points as quantization rules" (RG-H1.11): interesting but undeveloped
- The connection between scale-invariant boundary conditions and quantization rules could be a real result if proved generally, but here it is only a single example

## Severity-4 (style)

**S4.1 Label proliferation**
- ~30 labeled items (RG-P1.x, RG-H1.x, RG-D1.x, RG-E1.x)
- The "1" in P1.x does not correspond to section numbering
- Non-sequential: RG-H1.8a follows RG-H1.8 but RG-H1.9 is in Section 7

**S4.2 Length vs content ratio**
- 724 lines for: calculus analogy + tree bookkeeping (deferred) + 2D delta example + Schur complement toy
- Sections 5.1-5.9 (the 2D delta material) are well-done but could be ~30% tighter

## Positive assessment

- 2D delta potential treatment (Sections 5.1-5.7): explicit, correct, clean dimensional transmutation
- Wilsonian shell integration (RG-D1.2a): pedagogically valuable semigroup demonstration
- 1D/2D/3D comparison (Section 5.8) with explicit formulas: useful reference
- Convention map (Section 5.9): genuine service to reader
- RG-H1.12 (half-density kernel for point interactions): nice conceptual bridge to ordering-equivalence paper
- Explicit 1D delta scattering (RG-E1.1): clean, correct, well-presented

## Algebra checks

**RG-D1.1 (loop integral):** $I(E;\Lambda) = -\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}[\ln(\Lambda^2/k^2) + i\pi]$
- Standard result. The $i\pi$ from $\ln(-1)$ when continuing $\ln(E - \hbar^2q^2/2m)$ past the pole. Correct.

**RG-D1.2 (beta function):** $\beta(g_R) = \frac{m}{\pi\hbar^2} g_R^2$
- From $\mu d(1/g_R)/d\mu = -m/(\pi\hbar^2)$ and $d(1/g)/d\mu = -g^{-2} dg/d\mu$. Correct.

**RG-D1.2a (shell integration):** $I_{\text{shell}}(0; \Lambda', \Lambda) = -\frac{m}{\pi\hbar^2}\ln(\Lambda/\Lambda')$
- At $E=0$: $\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\Lambda'}^{\Lambda} q\,dq \cdot (-2m/\hbar^2 q^2) = -\frac{m}{\pi\hbar^2}\ln(\Lambda/\Lambda')$. Correct.

**RG-P1.6 (dimensional analysis):** $[g] = \text{length}^{d-2}$
- $[\delta^{(d)}] = L^{-d}$, $[H] = E = L^{-2}$ (natural units), so $[g] = L^{-2}/L^{-d} = L^{d-2}$. Correct.

**RG-D1.6b (Robin scaling):** $\beta_{\hat\lambda} = -\hat\lambda$
- $[\lambda] = L^{-1}$, $\hat\lambda = \lambda/\mu$, $\mu d\hat\lambda/d\mu = -\hat\lambda$ (engineering). Correct.

**3D loop integral (Section 5.8.1):** $I_{3D} = -\frac{m}{\pi^2\hbar^2}\Lambda - i\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}k + O(k^2/\Lambda)$
- Linear divergence in 3D: $\int_0^\Lambda q^2 dq / (k^2 - q^2) \sim -\Lambda$. The prefactor: $(2\pi)^{-3} \cdot 4\pi \cdot (-2m/\hbar^2) \cdot \Lambda = -m\Lambda/(\pi^2\hbar^2)$. Correct.

## Verdict

No fatal errors. The 2D delta material (Sections 5.1-5.9) is the paper's core strength and is mathematically sound. The interpretive framing ("RG is definitional," "two-layer QFT," "crown witnesses") continues the overclaiming pattern identified in the cross-paper diagnostic (notebooks/cross-paper-overclaiming-diagnostic.md). The Noether crown-witness issue is a direct repeat of the rcp-foundations error (S2.3 = Task #19 S2.1). Recommendations: (1) soften "RG is a structural requirement" to "RG can be read as a compatibility condition"; (2) mark two-layer decomposition as heuristic, not theorem; (3) fix Noether crown-witness claim consistently across rg-fundamental and rcp-foundations.
