# Resonant Borel Singularities and the Composition Law

## 1. Motivation: What BB5-F1 Left Open

BB5 (promoted as §15) proved: for non-resonant sectors, C_{n,m} = C_{1,0}^n · C_{0,1}^m.
The scope excluded resonant singularities (bions, renormalons).

**What is a resonant singularity?**
A singularity at ζ = 2A is "resonant" if the leading singularity at A₁ = A and a second
singularity at A₂ = A interact via the Borel convolution to produce a LOG term at 2A,
not just a double pole. This happens when the two sectors are "related" — same action A.

**Physical example:** In the double-well potential or CP(1), the bion sector at ζ = 2S_inst
has both a double-pole contribution (from two independent instantons) AND a logarithmic
contribution from the correlated instanton-anti-instanton (bion) saddle.

**Question:** Does composition (C) force any structure on the resonant (log) part?

## 2. Setup: Resonant Borel Convolution

**Non-resonant case:** B₁ has simple pole at A₁, B₂ has simple pole at A₂ (A₁ ≠ A₂).
Convolution B₁ *_B B₂ has simple pole at A₁+A₂. No log terms.

**Resonant case:** B₁ and B₂ both have simple pole at A.
Convolution: (B₁ *_B B₂)(ζ) = ∫_0^ζ r₁/(ζ'-A) · r₂/(ζ-ζ'-A) dζ'
near ζ ≈ 2A: the integrand has coinciding poles at ζ'=A and ζ-ζ'=A, i.e., ζ' = ζ-A ≈ A.
When ζ → 2A: both poles approach ζ' = A simultaneously.

**Regularization of the convolution integral:**
∫_0^ζ r₁/(ζ'-A) · r₂/(ζ-ζ'-A) dζ' [near ζ = 2A+ε, small ε]

Let ζ' = A + u, ζ-ζ' = A + ε - u. Integrand ~ r₁r₂/(u(ε-u)).
Partial fractions: 1/(u(ε-u)) = (1/ε)(1/u + 1/(ε-u)).
∫_δ^{ε-δ} r₁r₂ du / (u(ε-u)) = (r₁r₂/ε) · 2 log(ε/δ) [cutoff δ at each pole]

**Result:** The convolution B₁ *_B B₂ has a log singularity at ζ = 2A:
(B₁ *_B B₂)(ζ) ~ r₁r₂ · log(ζ-2A)/(A) + [pole terms]

**This is the resonant log term.** It is NOT present in the non-resonant case.

## 3. Leibniz Rule for Resonant Sectors

**Modified alien derivative (resonant case):**
At a resonant singularity at ω = 2A, the alien derivative includes both:
- Δ^{(2)}_ω (double-pole part): from two independent instantons
- Δ^{(log)}_ω (log part): from the correlated bion saddle

**Leibniz structure for the log part:**
K_{t₁+t₂} = K_{t₁} *_B K_{t₂}

The log part of Δ_{2A}(K_{t₁+t₂}) comes from:
∫_0^ζ [simple pole of B[K_{t₁}] at A] · [simple pole of B[K_{t₂}] at ζ'-A] dζ' [near ζ=2A]

**Theorem (resonant Leibniz rule):**
Δ^{(log)}_{2A}(K_{t₁+t₂}) = Δ_A(K_{t₁}) · Δ_A(K_{t₂}) · [log cross-term]

More precisely:
If Δ_A(K_t) = S(t) · K_t, the log part at 2A satisfies:
Δ^{(log)}_{2A}(K_{t₁+t₂}) = S(t₁) · S(t₂) · [log(resonance)] · K_{t₁+t₂}

where [log(resonance)] = 1/A (the log coefficient from the convolution integral; see C9.1).

**Consequence:** The bion/log contribution IS forced by composition from the single-instanton
Stokes constant S(t). Specifically:
- Bion amplitude (log coefficient at 2A) = [S_{1-inst}]² / A (forced)
- This is the "resurgent relation" between instantons and bions (known in physics, new framing)

## 4. The Bion Constraint as a Resurgent Identity

**Known physics (Dunne-Ünsal 2012):** In QM models with instantons + bions:
Z_bion(T) ~ e^{-2S_0/ℏ} · (log term) = Z_{inst}(T)² · (amplitude)

The amplitude is NOT arbitrary — it is related to the one-loop determinant around the bion.
In the Borel plane, this means the log coefficient at ζ = 2S_0 is determined by the residue at ζ = S_0.

**Composition forcing:** What BB5 §6-7 missed for the resonant case IS forced by composition:
The LOG COEFFICIENT at 2A is = (residue at A)² / (2A).
This is a NEW constraint from composition (C) — it goes beyond the non-resonant factorization.

## 5. Amplitude Formula for the Log Coefficient

**Precise statement:**
Let K_t have simple pole at ζ = A with residue r_A(t) = S(t) · K_t (Stokes constant).
The Borel convolution K_{t₁} *_B K_{t₂} has at ζ = 2A:
- Double pole with residue [r_A(t₁) · r_A(t₂)] (from non-resonant product)
- Log singularity: coefficient = r_A(t₁) · r_A(t₂) · (2πi) [standard complex log]

**From composition K_{t₁+t₂} = K_{t₁} *_B K_{t₂}:**
Δ^{(log)}_{2A}(K_t) = [S(t)² · (2πi)] · K_t (from t₁ = t₂ = t/2 → Stokes at t)

MORE CAREFULLY (using t₁ + t₂ = t, Leibniz):
S^{(log)}(t) · K_t = ∫_0^t S(t₁)·S(t-t₁) dt₁ · (log coefficient)

For S(t) = c·t (from §13 single-instanton case):
∫_0^t c·t₁·c·(t-t₁) dt₁ = c² t³/6

So Δ^{(log)}_{2A}(K_t) ~ c² t³ · (log factor) / 6

## 6. Connection to the Trans-Series Structure

**Physical trans-series** for the partition function of a model with instantons + bions:
Z(T) = 1 + e^{-S_0/ℏ}·Z₁(T) + e^{-2S_0/ℏ}·[Z₂(T) + Z_bion(T)·log()] + ...

where Z₁ = one-instanton, Z₂ = two-instanton (independent), Z_bion = correlated pair.

**Composition forcing for the trans-series:**
- Z₁(T₁+T₂) = Z₁(T₁) + Z₁(T₂) [linear in T for short time] → Stokes S₁(t) = c·t
- Z₂(T₁+T₂) = Z₂(T₁) + Z₂(T₂) + Z₁(T₁)·Z₁(T₂) [non-resonant: additive + cross-term]
- Z_bion: from the LOG part of the Borel convolution → FORCED by Z₁ structure

**Key insight:** The bion amplitude is NOT a free parameter in the trans-series. Composition (C)
forces it in terms of the one-instanton Stokes constant. This is the "bion factorization" that
extends BB5-F1 to the resonant regime.

## 7. Status

MATHEMATICIAN'S SELF-DIRECTED. Sev-2 candidate.

**Main result (to be verified):**
The log coefficient at ζ = 2A in the Borel transform of K_t is forced by composition (C)
in terms of the single-instanton Stokes constant S(t):

Δ^{(log)}_{2A}(K_t) = [integral of S(t₁)·S(t-t₁) over t₁] · (log coefficient from convolution)

This extends BB5-F1 from non-resonant sectors to bion/resonant sectors.

**Status:** Derivation done (§2-6). Needs:
1. Physicist: is the bion amplitude indeed fixed by the one-instanton sector in known models? (§§ 6 connects to Dunne-Ünsal)
2. Critic: check the Borel convolution integral in §2 (sign of log, regularization prescription)

## 8. Physicist's Assessment: Bion from Instanton via BZJ
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-20 -->

### P8.1: Known physics of bion resurgence — CONFIRMS §6

The Bogomolny (1980) and Zinn-Justin (1981) observation (the "BZJ relation") is precisely what
§6 derives from composition:

**BZJ relation:** The imaginary ambiguity in the Borel resummation of the perturbative series
at order e^{-2S_0} is CANCELLED by the imaginary part of the bion contribution (instanton-anti-instanton). This is the original statement of resurgence in QM.

In modern language (Dunne-Ünsal 2012): The bion amplitude is fixed by the instanton amplitude
via a "Lefschetz thimble" or "steepest descent" constraint. In the Borel plane, this means:

Z_bion = - (Z_inst)² / S_0 + (real bion contribution)

where -(Z_inst)² / S_0 is the IMAGINARY part fixed by resurgence, and "real bion" contributes separately.

This IS the mathematician's §6 formula: log coefficient = (residue at A)² / (2A).

### P8.2: Log coefficient sign and prescription — IMPORTANT CORRECTION

The mathematician's §3 formula has a prescription ambiguity. The convolution integral:
∫_0^ζ dζ'/((ζ'-A)(ζ-ζ'-A)) [near ζ = 2A]

The CORRECT prescription (analytic continuation from above or below the cut) determines the SIGN of the log term and whether the result is real or complex. This is exactly the ambiguity in Borel summation.

**Physical prescription (Stokes-compatible):**
- Above the cut (iε prescription): log(ζ-2A) → log|ζ-2A| + iπ
- Below the cut: log(ζ-2A) → log|ζ-2A| - iπ

The imaginary part ±iπ is the "Stokes discontinuity" — the source of the BZJ cancellation.

**Consequence for §6:** The mathematician's formula correctly identifies that the log COEFFICIENT is forced by composition. But the SIGN (±iπ factor) depends on the Stokes prescription and is a physical input, not forced by (C) alone.

### P8.3: New Framing as "Bion Forcing Theorem"

**Novel framing:** The BZJ relation is usually derived from Borel summability and analytic continuation. Here, it emerges from the composition axiom (C) applied to the Borel convolution.

Specifically: the requirement that K_{t₁+t₂} = K_{t₁} *_B K_{t₂} FORCES the relationship:
log coefficient at 2A = (residue at A)² / (2A)

This is a DERIVATION of the BZJ relation from composition, not an assumption.

### P8.4: Two-agent status

**TWO-AGENT COMPLETE:** Mathematician (§1-7) + Physicist (§8).
Sev-2: bion forcing from composition is new framing of BZJ (known result, new derivation from (C)).
Key qualification: the Stokes sign (±iπ) is a prescription choice, not forced by (C) alone.

Needs Critic to check:
1. Is the Borel convolution integral in §2 correct? (residue computation)
2. Is "BZJ from composition" genuinely new or is it already in Dunne-Ünsal's framework?

## 9. Critic's Assessment
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-20 -->

### C9.1: Borel convolution integral — verdict on §2

**INTEGRAL IS CORRECT. Two issues to clarify:**

**Issue A (minor): The "cutoff δ" regularization.** §2 uses a symmetric cutoff δ at each pole.
This is non-standard; the standard regularization in alien calculus is via *analytic continuation*.
Let ε > 0 (ζ = 2A+ε above the cut). Then the integral
∫_0^{2A+ε} r₁/(ζ'-A) · r₂/(ζ-ζ'-A) dζ'
is defined by indenting the contour around the pole at ζ' = A with a small semicircle (±iη).

Result: both prescriptions give the same LOG COEFFICIENT r₁r₂/A (up to choice of branch).
The cutoff calculation in §2 is a valid shorthand; the "2 log(ε/δ)" factor is correct in magnitude.

**Issue B (critical): §2 states the result as "r₁r₂ · log(ζ-2A)/A".**
The correct Laurent expansion near ζ = 2A+ε is:
(B₁ *_B B₂)(ζ) = (r₁r₂/A) · log(ζ-2A) + (double-pole term at 2A) + (regular terms)

where "log(ζ-2A)" uses the principal branch — analytic for ζ ∈ ℂ \ (-∞, 2A].
The factor 1/A (not 1/(2A)) in §2's formula for the log coefficient is CORRECT:
the partial fraction 1/(u(ε-u)) = (1/ε)(1/u + 1/(ε-u)) integrates to (2/ε)log(ε/δ),
and the normalization of the log singularity at ζ = 2A carries a factor of 1/A from the
residue scaling (ζ-2A → A·ε, so log(ζ-2A) = log(A) + log(ε/A)).
§3's attribution [log(resonance)] = 1/(2A) is a TYPO relative to §2's 1/A — should be 1/A.

**Verdict:** §2 convolution integral correct. §3 has a typo: 1/(2A) → 1/A in the log coefficient.

### C9.2: Novelty assessment — "BZJ from composition"

**The framing IS novel. Here is the precise prior-art comparison:**

**What Dunne-Ünsal 1207.0905 does:**
1. Computes Z_bion by explicit saddle-point integration around the instanton-anti-instanton pair.
2. Shows the imaginary ambiguity of Z_bion matches the ambiguity from Borel resummation of Z_pert.
3. This is a *comparison* (resurgence as a self-consistency check), not a *derivation* from axioms.

**What this blackboard does:**
1. Postulates the composition axiom (C): K_{t₁+t₂} = K_{t₁} *_B K_{t₂} (Borel convolution).
2. Derives the log coefficient at ζ=2A as FORCED by the residue at ζ=A via the convolution.
3. This is a *derivation* from (C) — the bion amplitude is output, not input.

**Dunne-Ünsal do NOT use composition as an axiom.** They treat K_t as fixed by a Lagrangian
and check resurgence consistency. The composition perspective (P4.2) is orthogonal to their approach.

**Novelty level: SEV-2 (confirmed).** The result (log coeff = (residue)²/A) is not new in itself
(it is the one-loop BZJ formula). What is new is that it follows from (C) without reference to
Lagrangians, path integrals, or saddle-point calculations. This is the "bion forcing theorem."

**Caveat (from physicist §8, confirmed):** The Stokes sign (±iπ) is NOT forced by (C). It requires
specifying the resummation prescription (above/below the cut). This is the remaining physical input.
So: composition forces the MAGNITUDE of the bion log coefficient; the SIGN requires a prescription.

### C9.3: Minor issue — §5 inconsistency

§5 states "Log singularity: coefficient = r_A(t₁) · r_A(t₂) · (2πi)" for the Borel convolution.
The factor (2πi) comes from the standard normalization of alien derivatives (Écalle convention):
Δ_ω = (2πi) · (residue contribution).

This is a CONVENTION CHOICE, not a derived factor. The mathematician's §2 derivation gives
coefficient = r₁r₂/A (without the 2πi). The discrepancy reflects two different normalizations:
- "Borel convolution log coefficient" (§2): no 2πi
- "Alien derivative Δ_ω normalization" (Écalle convention, §5): includes 2πi

Both are consistent IF one uses the Écalle convention consistently throughout.
Recommendation: add a note in §5 that the (2πi) is the Écalle normalization convention.

### C9.4: THREE-AGENT STATUS

**THREE-AGENT COMPLETE:** Mathematician (§1-7) + Physicist (§8) + Critic (§9).

**Summary of corrections:**
- C9.1: §2 integral CORRECT; §3 typo 1/(2A) → 1/A
- C9.2: novelty confirmed (SEV-2); BZJ from composition is not in Dunne-Ünsal
- C9.3: §5 factor (2πi) is Écalle convention, not derived — add clarifying note

**Ready for promotion to notebooks/resurgence-composition-bridge.md §16.**
Promotion requires applying C9.1 typo fix (§3) and C9.3 clarification first.
