# V_HD on Riemannian Products: Additivity and d=4 Selection

## §1. Product Additivity Theorem

**Theorem C5.1.** Let \((M_1, g_1)\), \((M_2, g_2)\) be Riemannian manifolds. On \((M_1 \times M_2, g_1 \oplus g_2)\):
\[V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_1 \times M_2) = V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_1) + V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_2)\]
in product coordinates.

**Proof:**
1. \(|g_M| = |g_1| \cdot |g_2|\) (block-diagonal).
2. \(|g_M|^{-1/4} = |g_1|^{-1/4} \cdot |g_2|^{-1/4}\).
3. \(\Delta_M = \Delta_1 + \Delta_2\) (no cross terms).
4. \(\Delta_M(|g_M|^{-1/4}) = |g_2|^{-1/4}\Delta_1(|g_1|^{-1/4}) + |g_1|^{-1/4}\Delta_2(|g_2|^{-1/4})\).
   Cross terms vanish: \(\partial_{x_1}(|g_2|^{-1/4}) = 0\), \(\partial_{x_2}(|g_1|^{-1/4}) = 0\).
5. \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -|g_M|^{1/4}\Delta_M(|g_M|^{-1/4}) = V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_1) + V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_2)\). \(\square\)

## §2. Corollaries

**Corollary C5.2 (Constancy criterion).** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant on \(M_1 \times \cdots \times M_k\) iff constant on each \(M_i\).

**Corollary C5.3 (Sphere products).** On \(S^{d_1} \times \cdots \times S^{d_k}\) (geodesic polar coords):
\(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant \(\iff\) every \(d_i \in \{1, 3\}\).

**Corollary C5.4 (R/6 on products of constant-V_HD factors).** If \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_i)\) is constant for each \(i\), then \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M) = -R(M)/6\) everywhere on \(M\).
*Proof:* Each factor has \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R_i/6\) (RNC + constancy, Thm M0.3 logic). Sum: \(-\sum R_i/6 = -R/6\).

## §3. S^2 x S^2 Verification (d=4, NON-constant V_HD)

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^2 \times S^2) = \left[-\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4\sin^2\theta_1}\right] + \left[-\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4\sin^2\theta_2}\right]\)

Numerical finite-difference verification (8 points, all match to \(< 10^{-5}\)):

| \(\theta_1\) | \(\theta_2\) | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) analytic | FD numeric | diff |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|------|
| \(\pi/2\) | \(\pi/2\) | \(-1.0000\) | \(-1.0000\) | \(8 \times 10^{-8}\) |
| \(\pi/3\) | \(\pi/4\) | \(-1.3333\) | \(-1.3333\) | \(10^{-6}\) |
| \(\pi/6\) | \(\pi/2\) | \(-1.7500\) | \(-1.7500\) | \(10^{-6}\) |
| \(\pi/5\) | \(\pi/7\) | \(-2.5516\) | \(-2.5516\) | \(9 \times 10^{-6}\) |

\(R(S^2 \times S^2) = 4\). \(-R/6 = -2/3\). But \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) ranges \([-\infty, -1]\). **NOT constant.**

## §4. S^3 x S^1 (d=4, CONSTANT V_HD)

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^3) = -1\) (FOUR-AGENT, BB4). \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^1) = 0\) (flat).

By C5.1: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^3 \times S^1) = -1\). **Constant.**

\(R(S^3 \times S^1) = 6\). \(-R/6 = -1\). **MATCH** (Corollary C5.4).

## §5. d=4 Uniqueness Among Sphere Products

All partitions of 4 (as sphere dimensions):

| Product | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) constant? | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| \(S^4\) | NO (\(d=4 \notin \{1,3\}\)) | — |
| \(S^3 \times S^1\) | **YES** | \(-1\) |
| \(S^2 \times S^2\) | NO (\(d=2 \notin \{1,3\}\)) | — |
| \(S^2 \times S^1 \times S^1\) | NO (\(d=2\)) | — |
| \(T^4 = (S^1)^4\) | YES (trivially: flat) | \(0\) |

**\(S^3 \times S^1\) is the unique nontrivial d=4 sphere product with constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\).**

## §6. Extended Catalogue (Constant-V_HD Products)

| Product | dim | \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) | \(-R/6\) | Match? |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| \(S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^n\) | \(3+n\) | \(-1\) | \(-1\) | YES |
| \(S^3 \times S^1\) | 4 | \(-1\) | \(-1\) | YES |
| \(S^3 \times S^3\) | 6 | \(-2\) | \(-2\) | YES |
| \(\mathrm{SU}(N)\) | \(N^2-1\) | \(-N(N^2-1)/24\) | same | YES |
| \(H^3 \times S^3\) (unit radii) | 6 | \(0\) | \(0\) | YES |
| \(T^n\) | \(n\) | \(0\) | \(0\) | YES |

All constant-\(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) spaces have \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) (RNC value extended globally).

## §7. Connection to D=4 Coincidence (BB2)

The BB2 result: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) on \(S^{D-1}\) constant iff \(D=4\).

Product theorem adds: among products of spheres totaling \(d\) dimensions, constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) requires all factors \(\in \{S^1, S^3\}\). The minimal nontrivial solution at \(d = D-1 = 3\) is \(S^3\) itself. At \(d=4\): \(S^3 \times S^1\).

Physical interpretation: \(S^3 \times S^1\) arises as Euclidean de Sitter \(\times\) thermal circle (Gibbons-Hawking). Constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) on this background = no position-dependent ordering correction in thermal quantum gravity on de Sitter.

## §8. Non-Homogeneous Witness Summary

\(S^2 \times S^2\) is the first example with:
- Constant scalar curvature (\(R = 4\))
- NON-constant sectional curvature
- NON-constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) despite constant \(R\)
- Total dimension 4

This proves that **constant \(R\) does NOT imply constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\)**. The Lie group theorem (Prop M0.1) uses bi-invariance, not constant curvature.

**Scripts:** `tmp/product_vhd.py`, `tmp/product_vhd_v3.py`.

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (computationalist). Proof + numeric verification complete. Needs second agent.**

## §9. Physicist Second-Agent Review
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-22 -->

**P9.1 Theorem C5.1 (product additivity): VERIFIED.**
Proof is elementary (block-diagonal determinant, separable Laplacian). No subtlety missed. The key step is that cross terms vanish because |g_1| depends only on x_1 coordinates and |g_2| only on x_2 coordinates.

**P9.2 Corollaries C5.2-C5.4: CORRECT.**
- C5.2 follows trivially from additivity.
- C5.3 uses the established alpha(alpha-1)=0 criterion (BB4/BB6 FOUR-AGENT).
- C5.4 uses Theorem M0.3 logic (RNC + constancy → -R/6 globally). The sum formula R(M1 x M2) = R(M1) + R(M2) for product metrics is standard (Ricci curvature separates, no cross terms).

**P9.3 S^2 x S^2 witness (§3, §8): IMPORTANT.**
This is the cleanest demonstration that constant R does NOT imply constant V_HD. Physical content: S^2 x S^2 has constant R = 4 but V_HD ranges from -1 to -infinity (approaching the poles). The ordering correction is genuinely position-dependent despite homogeneous curvature. This settles the natural question "is V_HD a function of R alone?" — NO.

**P9.4 S^3 x S^1 (§4, §7): PHYSICALLY INTERESTING.**
S^3 x S^1 = Euclidean de Sitter x thermal circle (Gibbons-Hawking, temperature T_GH = H/(2pi)). Constant V_HD = -1 means: in the thermal partition function of a scalar on de Sitter, the half-density ordering produces NO position-dependent correction. The thermal trace Z = Tr(e^{-beta H_tilde}) treats all spatial points equally.

**P9.5 d=4 uniqueness (§5): VERIFIED.**
Partition enumeration complete. S^3 x S^1 and T^4 are the only d=4 sphere products with constant V_HD. The non-trivial answer is S^3 x S^1 (the flat torus T^4 is trivial).

**P9.6 Catalogue (§6): CHECKED.**
- SU(N): V_HD = -dim·h^vee/24, R/6 = dim·h^vee/24 with proper normalization. Match.
- H^3 x S^3: V_HD = (+1/4) + (-1) = -3/4. R = 3/2 (S^3, R=6/4=3/2 for suitable radius) — WAIT. Need to check normalization. For unit S^3: R = 6, V_HD = -1. For unit H^3: R = -6, V_HD = -1/4 (from BB6 formula -(d-1)R/(4d) = -2(-6)/(12) = +1). So V_HD(H^3 x S^3) = 1 + (-1) = 0? Let me recheck.

**Sev-3 RESOLVED:** §6 H^3 x S^3 entry corrected from -3/4 to 0 (unit H^3: V_HD=+1, unit S^3: V_HD=-1, sum=0). R(H^3 x S^3)=0, -R/6=0. MATCH.

**P9.7 Connection to Lorentzian signature.**
The product theorem has an important physical consequence: in the Hamiltonian path integral on a static spacetime, V_HD is determined by the SPATIAL metric alone (not the full 4D metric). For static spacetimes with spatial section M, V_HD = V_HD(M). The lapse function N does not contribute because it enters the action, not the spatial measure. This means our Riemannian witnesses (S^2, S^3, H^2, Lie groups) directly give the ordering corrections in the corresponding Lorentzian spacetimes.

**Verdict: APPROVE. Sev-3 already fixed in §6.**

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT (computationalist + physicist). APPROVED.**

## §10. Mathematician Third-Agent Review
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-22 -->

**M10.1 Theorem C5.1 (product additivity): VERIFIED.**
Proof is rigorous. Key: (a) block-diagonal determinant factorizes, (b) product Laplacian separates, (c) Leibniz gives exactly two terms with no cross derivatives. No hidden hypothesis needed (works for any product, not just compact factors).

**M10.2 Corollary C5.4 (V_HD = -R/6 on constant-V_HD products): IMPORTANT.**
Generalizes Theorem M0.3 (BB0 §13) beyond Lie groups: ANY Riemannian manifold with constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) has \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -R/6\) globally. Proof: evaluate at any \(p\) in RNC centered at \(p\); \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) (general fact). If constant, this equals \(-R/6\) everywhere.

**M10.3 New observation: a_1 = 0 universally.**
The Seeley-DeWitt first coefficient for \(\Delta_{1/2} = \Delta_g + V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is:
\[a_1(\Delta_{1/2}) = R/6 + V_{\mathrm{HD}}.\]
Since \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(p) = -R(p)/6\) in RNC at \(p\), and \(a_1\) is a local invariant computed in RNC: \(a_1 = 0\) EVERYWHERE, on ANY Riemannian manifold, in ANY dimension. Composition forces the half-density Laplacian (P4.2), which automatically has \(a_1 = 0\) — no first-order curvature counterterm. This extends the D=4 observation in notebooks/oq1a §620 to all \(d\).

**M10.4 S^2 x S^2 (§3, §8): CORRECT.**
Confirms \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is NOT a function of \(R\) alone. Sharp witness.

**M10.5 d=4 enumeration (§5): VERIFIED.**
Partition enumeration of 4 complete. \(S^3 \times S^1\) is the unique nontrivial answer.

**M10.6 H^3 x S^3 (§6): CORRECT.**
Unit H^3: \(R=-6\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = +1\). Unit S^3: \(R=6\), \(V_{\mathrm{HD}} = -1\). Sum = 0 = \(-R/6\). Table is correct.

**Verdict: APPROVE. Theorem C5.1 is clean, corollaries correct, witnesses sharp.**

**STATUS: THREE-AGENT (computationalist + physicist + mathematician). UNANIMOUS APPROVE.**
