# Heat-Kernel Witness in Half-Density Language (S283)

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent: D26 (heat-kernel / half-density semantics as QFT-grade witness)

## 1. Setup: conventions and the half-density heat kernel

Let \((M,g)\) be a closed Riemannian \(D\)-manifold (compact, no boundary). Consider
the scalar kinetic operator
\[
P = -\nabla^2 + \xi R + m^2,
\]
symmetric in the metric pairing \((\phi_1,\phi_2)_g = \int_M \sqrt{|g|}\,\phi_1\phi_2\,d^Dx\).

**Half-density conjugation.** Define \(\psi = |g|^{1/4}\phi\). The conjugated operator
\[
\widetilde{P} = |g|^{1/4} P |g|^{-1/4}
\]
is symmetric in the **coordinate** pairing \(\langle\psi_1,\psi_2\rangle = \int \psi_1\psi_2\,d^Dx\).

**Heat kernel.** The scalar heat kernel \(K(t;x,y)\) satisfies
\((\partial_t + P_x)K = 0\) with \(K(0;x,y) = \delta_g(x,y) := |g(x)|^{-1/2}\delta^{(D)}(x-y)\).
The half-density heat kernel is
\[
\widetilde{K}(t;x,y) := |g(x)|^{1/4}\,K(t;x,y)\,|g(y)|^{1/4}.
\]
It satisfies \((\partial_t + \widetilde{P}_x)\widetilde{K} = 0\) with initial condition
\[
\widetilde{K}(0;x,y) = \delta^{(D)}(x-y),
\]
the **canonical** (coordinate) delta, with no \(\sqrt{|g|}\) factor.

This is the first key point: \(\widetilde{K}(t) \to K_{\mathrm{Id}}\) as \(t\to 0^+\),
where \(K_{\mathrm{Id}}(x,y) = \delta^{(D)}(x-y)\,|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}\) is the
identity kernel in the bi-half-density sense.

## 2. DeWitt-Schwinger expansion in half-density form

The standard short-time asymptotic expansion [DeWitt1965, Vassilevich2003] reads
\[
K(t;x,y) \sim (4\pi t)^{-D/2}\,\Delta^{1/2}(x,y)\,e^{-\sigma(x,y)/(2t)}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(x,y)\,t^n,
\]
where \(\sigma(x,y) = \tfrac{1}{2}d(x,y)^2\) is Synge's world function, \(\Delta(x,y)\)
is the Van Vleck-Morette determinant, and \(a_n(x,y)\) are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients
(\(a_0(x,x)=1\)).

Conjugating to half-densities:
\[
\widetilde{K}(t;x,y) = (4\pi t)^{-D/2}\,
\underbrace{|g(x)|^{1/4}\,\Delta^{1/2}(x,y)\,|g(y)|^{1/4}}_{\text{bi-half-density transport factor}}
\,e^{-\sigma(x,y)/(2t)}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(x,y)\,t^n.
\]

The combination \(|g(x)|^{1/4}\,\Delta^{1/2}(x,y)\,|g(y)|^{1/4}\) transforms as a
bi-half-density under coordinate changes in both slots. At coincidence (\(x=y\)):
\(\Delta(x,x) = 1\) and \(\sigma(x,x)=0\), so
\[
\widetilde{K}(t;x,x) = (4\pi t)^{-D/2}\,|g(x)|^{1/2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n(x,x)\,t^n.
\]

**The \(D/2\) exponent.** The prefactor \((4\pi t)^{-D/2}\) is universal: it is forced
by the requirement that \(\widetilde{K}(t) \to \delta^{(D)}\) as \(t\to 0^+\). Explicitly,
the Gaussian approximate identity
\[
\rho_t(x) = (4\pi t)^{-D/2}\exp\!\bigl(-|x|^2/(4t)\bigr)
\]
satisfies \(\int \rho_t\,d^Dx = 1\) (by rescaling \(x = \sqrt{t}\,u\), which produces
the factor \(t^{D/2}\) cancelling the prefactor). The same \(D/2\) appears:
- in the identity kernel normalization (HD-D1.1a),
- in the heat kernel leading term,
- in the propagator via Schwinger parametrization: \(G = \int_0^\infty K(t)\,dt\)
  gives \(\Gamma(D/2-1)/(4\pi)^{D/2}\) (flat-space massless case),
- in the UV divergence degree: proper-time cutoff at \(t_{\min}=\Lambda^{-2}\)
  yields \(\int_0^{\Lambda^{-2}} t^{n-D/2}\,dt \sim \Lambda^{D-2-2n}\),
- in dimensional regularization: the \(\Gamma\)-function pole at \(D = 2(n+1)\).

All five manifestations trace to the single fact that the half-density identity kernel
on \(\mathbb{R}^D\) scales as \(\varepsilon^{-D/2}\).

## 3. The conjugation potential: universal \(V(p) = \tfrac{1}{6}R\)

The conjugated kinetic operator \(\widetilde{P}_{\mathrm{kin}} = -|g|^{1/4}\nabla^2|g|^{-1/4}\)
differs from \(-\partial^2\) by a zeroth-order potential term (the "conjugation potential").
Writing \(\omega = \tfrac{1}{4}\ln|g|\), one has
\[
\widetilde{P}_{\mathrm{kin}} = -\partial^2 + (\text{first-order terms}) + V,
\qquad V = |\nabla\omega|_g^2 - \Delta_g\omega.
\]

**Normal-coordinate computation (universal).** In Riemannian normal coordinates
centered at a point \(p\), the metric determinant expands as
\[
|g(x)| = 1 - \tfrac{1}{3}R_{\mu\nu}x^\mu x^\nu + O(x^3),
\]
hence \(\omega(x) = -\tfrac{1}{12}R_{\mu\nu}x^\mu x^\nu + O(x^3)\). At \(p\):
- \(\nabla\omega|_p = 0\) (quadratic in \(x\)),
- \(\Delta_g\omega|_p = \delta^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\partial_\nu\omega|_0 = -\tfrac{1}{6}\delta^{\mu\nu}R_{\mu\nu} = -\tfrac{1}{6}R\).

Therefore
\[
\boxed{V(p) = \tfrac{1}{6}R}
\]
for **any** Riemannian metric in **any** dimension \(D\). This is a universal
consequence of the half-density weight, not a convention or gauge choice.

## 4. Connection to \(a_1\) and conformal coupling

The first Seeley-DeWitt coefficient at coincidence for \(P = -\nabla^2 + \xi R + m^2\) is
\[
a_1(x,x) = \bigl(\tfrac{1}{6} - \xi\bigr)R.
\]
In the half-density framework, this arises as follows. The conjugated operator is
\[
\widetilde{P} = -\partial^2 + (\text{1st order}) + V + \xi R + m^2,
\]
where \(V = \tfrac{1}{6}R\). The curvature content of \(a_1\) at coincidence is
the effective potential of \(\widetilde{P}\), which is \((\tfrac{1}{6}+\xi-\xi)R = \tfrac{1}{6}R\)
minus the \(\xi R\) contribution from the original operator, giving
\((\tfrac{1}{6}-\xi)R\). (More precisely, \(a_1\) receives contributions from
both the connection and the endomorphism/potential of the operator; the
computation above captures the scalar case.)

**Conformal coupling.** Conformal coupling corresponds to \(\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} = (D-2)/(4(D-1))\).
The total curvature potential of the conformally coupled half-density field is
\[
V_{\mathrm{tot}} = \bigl(\tfrac{1}{6} - \xi_{\mathrm{conf}}\bigr)R
= \frac{(D-4)(D+2)}{12(D-1)(D)}\,\cdot\,D\,R
= \frac{(D-4)(D+2)}{12(D-1)}R.
\]
Wait -- let me compute this cleanly.

\(\tfrac{1}{6} - \tfrac{D-2}{4(D-1)} = \tfrac{2(D-1) - 3(D-2)}{12(D-1)} = \tfrac{2D-2-3D+6}{12(D-1)} = \tfrac{-D+4}{12(D-1)} = \tfrac{4-D}{12(D-1)}\).

So:
\[
a_1(x,x)\big|_{\xi=\xi_{\mathrm{conf}}} = \frac{4-D}{12(D-1)}\,R.
\]

This vanishes **if and only if \(D=4\)**.

**Interpretation.** At \(D=4\), the half-density conjugation potential \(V = \tfrac{1}{6}R\)
exactly equals the conformal coupling \(\xi_{\mathrm{conf}}R = \tfrac{1}{6}R\). The
conformally coupled half-density field has no leading curvature correction to
its heat kernel at coincidence: the half-density weight absorbs the conformal
coupling entirely. This is a coincidence special to \(D=4\); in other dimensions,
there is a residual \(a_1 \neq 0\).

## 5. The trace and the D/2 pole structure

The heat-kernel trace in the half-density framework is
\[
\mathrm{Tr}\,e^{-tP} = \int_M \widetilde{K}(t;x,x)\,d^Dx
= (4\pi t)^{-D/2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} A_n\,t^n,
\]
where \(A_n = \int_M a_n(x,x)\sqrt{|g|}\,d^Dx\) are the integrated Seeley-DeWitt
coefficients (geometric invariants of \((M,g,P)\)). The key point: the factor
\(\sqrt{|g|}\) in \(A_n\) comes from \(\widetilde{K}(t;x,x) = (4\pi t)^{-D/2}|g|^{1/2}\sum a_n t^n\).

The spectral zeta function \(\zeta_P(s) = \mathrm{Tr}\,P^{-s}\) has poles at
\(s = D/2 - n\) (\(n = 0,1,2,\ldots\)), with residues proportional to \(A_n\).

In dimensional regularization (continuing \(D\)), the \(n\)-th counterterm has
a \(\Gamma\)-function pole at \(D = 2(n+1)\):
- \(n=0\) (mass counterterm): pole at \(D=2\), degree \(\Lambda^{D-2}\),
- \(n=1\) (wave-function counterterm): pole at \(D=4\), degree \(\Lambda^{D-4}\),
- \(n=2\) (curvature-squared counterterms): pole at \(D=6\), degree \(\Lambda^{D-6}\).

This hierarchy is **scheme-independent**: the \(D/2\) exponent organizes it
identically whether one uses proper-time cutoff, zeta-function, or dim-reg.

## 6. What is canonical vs what is scalarization

**Canonical (convention-free):**
- The identity kernel \(K_{\mathrm{Id}} = \delta^{(D)}(x-y)|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}\).
- The heat kernel as bi-half-density \(\widetilde{K}(t;x,y)\) and its \(t\to 0^+\) limit.
- The \((4\pi t)^{-D/2}\) normalization (forced by \(\int\rho_t = 1\)).
- The Seeley-DeWitt coefficients \(a_n(x,y)\) as geometric invariants.
- The integrated coefficients \(A_n\) and the resulting pole structure.
- The conjugation potential \(V(p) = \tfrac{1}{6}R\) (universal, all \(D\), all metrics).

**Scalarization (convention-dependent):**
- The choice to use \(|g|^{1/4}\) as the reference half-density (this is "metrically natural"
  but not the only option; any nowhere-vanishing half-density would work).
- The split between "half-density conjugation artifact" (\(V\)) and "physical curvature
  coupling" (\(\xi R\)) in the kinetic operator: only their difference \((\tfrac{1}{6}-\xi)R\)
  is physical in the sense of appearing in \(a_1\).
- The conformal-class cancellation \(D(4-D)(\partial\sigma)^2\) (specific to conformal
  metrics; not a property of the half-density formalism per se, but of the metric
  structure within a conformal class).

## 7. Summary statement (promotable)

> In the half-density convention, the heat kernel \(\widetilde{K}(t;x,y) = |g(x)|^{1/4}K(t;x,y)|g(y)|^{1/4}\) is a proper bi-half-density whose \(t\to 0^+\) limit is the canonical identity kernel \(\delta^{(D)}(x-y)\,|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}\). The leading normalization \((4\pi t)^{-D/2}\) is the same \(D/2\) exponent that controls the UV divergence degree in proper-time regularization and the \(\Gamma\)-function pole location in dimensional regularization. The first curvature correction \(a_1(x,x) = (\tfrac{1}{6}-\xi)R\) decomposes into a universal conjugation potential \(V = \tfrac{1}{6}R\) (the half-density artifact, present for any metric in any dimension) and the explicit curvature coupling \(\xi R\). Conformal coupling \(\xi_{\mathrm{conf}} = (D-2)/(4(D-1))\) exactly cancels \(V\) if and only if \(D=4\): only in four dimensions does the conformally coupled half-density field have a vanishing leading heat-kernel curvature correction.
