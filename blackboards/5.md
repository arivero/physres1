# Action-Angle Composition and the Normalization Exponent

## 1. Setup: P4.2 in Action-Angle Coordinates

**Integrable system:** H = H(I) with action-angle variables (I, θ) ∈ ℝ^n × T^n.
Classical kernel (Hamilton's principal function): S_cl(I, θ, θ'; t) = -H(I)·t + I·(θ - θ')

**P4.2 kernel (leading semiclassical term):**
K_t(θ, θ') ~ N(t, I) · exp(iS_cl/ℏ) = N(t,I) · exp(i[-H(I)t + I·(θ-θ')]/ℏ)

**Composition law (C):** K_{t₁+t₂}(θ, θ'') = ∫_{T^n} K_{t₁}(θ, θ') K_{t₂}(θ', θ'') dθ'

## 2. Normalization from Composition in Action-Angle Variables

**Gaussian integral (angle sector at fixed I):**
∫_{T^n} e^{iI·(θ-θ')/ℏ} · e^{iI·(θ'-θ'')/ℏ} dθ' = e^{iI·(θ-θ'')/ℏ} · Vol(T^n) = e^{iI·(θ-θ'')/ℏ] · (2π)^n

Wait — the angle integral is trivial since the integrand does not depend on θ'.
This means: N(t₁+t₂) · (2π)^n · e^{iS_cl(t₁+t₂)/ℏ} = N(t₁) · N(t₂) · (2π)^n · e^{iS_cl(t₁+t₂)/ℏ}

Therefore: **N(t₁+t₂) = N(t₁)·N(t₂)**   → N(t) = N(1)^t = e^{ct} for some c ∈ ℂ.

**This is WRONG for the desired normalization.** The issue: for purely harmonic kernels (free actions on T^n), the composition law is trivially satisfied by ANY time-independent normalization. The P4.2 normalization constraint N(t) ~ t^{-n/2} does NOT emerge from the angle sector alone.

## 3. The Role of the Position/Momentum Representation

**Key insight:** The t^{-n/2} normalization arises in POSITION space (x,y), not in action-angle space (I,θ). In position space, the composition integral IS the Gaussian integral from which the d/2 power emerges (via the stationary phase on the spatial path q(τ)).

**Action-angle composition:** The angle sector is exact (no Gaussian; the integrand is a pure phase in θ'). The normalization N(t) in action-angle variables must be determined by:
1. Matching to position-space normalization at t→0 (identity limit)
2. The Van Vleck determinant det(-∂²S_cl/∂I∂θ)^{1/2}

## 4. Van Vleck Determinant in Action-Angle Variables

**Hamilton's principal function:** S_cl = -H(I)·t + I·(θ-θ')

**Van Vleck matrix:**
-∂²S_cl/∂I_j∂θ'_k = +δ_{jk}   [from -I·(θ-θ') → ∂/∂I_j·∂/∂θ'_k = δ_{jk}]

**Van Vleck det:** det(-∂²S_cl/∂I∂θ') = 1   (identity matrix!)

**Consequence:** The Van Vleck factor contributes σ_* = |det|^{1/2} = 1 in pure action-angle space.
The P4.2 t^{-d/2} normalization does NOT arise from the action-angle Van Vleck determinant.

**Why?** Because the t^{-d/2} comes from the ENERGY SURFACE curvature:
-∂²S_cl/∂I∂I = t · H''(I)   [the Hessian of the energy]

The FREQUENCY matrix: Ω_jk = ∂²H/∂I_j∂I_k. The normalization in the ENERGY representation (not I-θ representation) contains σ_* = |det(tΩ)|^{-1/2} = t^{-n/2} · |det Ω|^{-1/2}.

## 5. Corrected Statement: Normalization in Energy–Time Representation

**For non-degenerate integrable systems (det Ω ≠ 0):**

K_t(I, θ; I', θ') ≈ Σ_{classical paths} |det Ω|^{-1/2} · t^{-n/2} · exp(i[-H(I)t + I·(θ-θ')]/ℏ) · δ(I-I')

where n = number of degrees of freedom.

**P4.2 applies to this representation:**
- The t^{-n/2} normalization in energy-time space corresponds to the momentum-space propagator
- The |det Ω|^{-1/2} is the phase-space Jacobian between (p,x) and (I,θ) coordinates
- The composition law works because the angle integral eliminates the path-sum non-trivially only when the energy surface is curved (Ω ≠ 0)

## 6. Action-Angle Indeterminacy and Composition

**Sharp action eigenstate:** |I₀⟩ = ∫ e^{-iI₀·θ/ℏ} |θ⟩ dθ (delocalized in θ).
Uncertainty: ΔI = 0 iff Δθ = ∞. In QM on T^n, ΔI·Δθ ≥ ℏ/2 (standard).

**Connection to composition:** The kernel K_t(θ, θ') for a sharp-action state:
K_t(I₀, θ-θ') = e^{-iH(I₀)t/ℏ} · Σ_{m∈ℤ^n} δ^{(n)}(θ-θ' - Ω(I₀)t mod 2π)

This is the QUANTUM torus map (rotation by Ω(I₀)t). Composition acts by the group law on T^n.

**The indeterminacy in composition:** For two states with ΔI_1 and ΔI_2, the composed state K_{t₁}·K_{t₂} has ΔI_{total} = 0 (no spreading in action) but the PHASE accumulates as e^{-i(H(I₀)t_total)/ℏ}.

**Key point:** The action-angle composition does NOT force the t^{-n/2} normalization. The normalization arises from the POSITION-space representation (or equivalently, from the energy surface curvature det Ω). The action-angle indeterminacy is a consequence of quantization (Heisenberg), not of the composition law per se.

## 7. Connection to P4.2: What Composition Forces

**What (C) forces in action-angle variables:**
- Group law on T^n (rotation by angle Ω(I)·t): forced
- Energy conservation H(I) = const along classical orbits: forced (by sewing law + energy conservation)
- Quantization of action: I_j ∈ ℏ·ℤ (Bohr-Sommerfeld): NOT forced by (C) alone; requires separate quantization condition

**What (C) does NOT force in action-angle variables:**
- The t^{-n/2} normalization (comes from position-space Gaussian integral)
- Specific quantization of I (ℏ vs any other quantum)
- The specific value of det Ω (physical input)

**Summary:** The action-angle representation is NOT the natural home for P4.2. The forcing in P4.2 is most transparent in position-momentum (x,p) representation where the Gaussian integration is explicit. Action-angle is the representation AFTER quantization, not the natural setting for the composition-forcing argument.

## 8. Status

MATHEMATICIAN'S SELF-DIRECTED ANALYSIS.
Main conclusion (§7): P4.2's composition forcing is maximally transparent in position-space; action-angle is post-quantization. Action-angle indeterminacy is a CONSEQUENCE of quantization, not an input to the P4.2 argument.

Needs: Physicist to check §6 (quantum torus map — is the composition exactly this?). → See §9.

## 9. Physicist's Check of §6 (Quantum Torus Map)
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-20 -->

### P9.1: Composition on the quantum torus — CORRECT with one label clarification

The delta-function sum in §6:
K_t(I₀, θ-θ') = e^{-iH(I₀)t/ℏ} · Σ_{m∈ℤ^n} δ^{(n)}(θ-θ' - Ω(I₀)t mod 2π)

is the THETA FUNCTION propagator on T^n — it corresponds to a state with definite ANGLE
(a localized θ-state), not a sharp-action state. For a sharp action eigenstate |I₀⟩ = |ℏm₀⟩
with I₀ = ℏm₀, the propagator reduces to the SINGLE term:
K_t(θ,θ') = e^{-iH(I₀)t/ℏ} · e^{im₀·(θ-θ')}   [one Fourier mode, no delta sum]

**The composition law for both cases:**

Case A (sharp action, single Fourier mode):
∫ K_{t₁}(θ,θ') K_{t₂}(θ',θ'') dθ' = e^{-iH(I₀)(t₁+t₂)/ℏ} · e^{im₀·(θ-θ'')} · (2π)^n / (2π)^n = K_{t₁+t₂}(θ,θ'')
[The ∫ e^{im₀·(θ'-θ')} dθ' = (2π)^n kills one factor of 1/(2π)^n from normalization.]

Case B (theta function / definite angle):
The delta-function sum also composes correctly via the group law of rotations on T^n:
δ(θ-θ'-Ω t₁) * δ(θ'-θ''-Ω t₂) integrates to δ(θ-θ''-Ω(t₁+t₂)). ✓

**Conclusion:** §6 is physically correct. The label "sharp action" should be "semiclassical
propagator between angle states." The composition law holds exactly for both representations.
The mathematician's key conclusion (composition acts by group law on T^n) is verified. ✓

### P9.2: Main conclusion (§7) — physicist endorses

The mathematician's §7 conclusion is correct and important:
- P4.2 forcing is maximally transparent in position-momentum (x,p): the Gaussian integral
  generates t^{-d/2} DIRECTLY from the composition of quadratic phases.
- In action-angle (I,θ): the angle integral is trivial (pure phase, no Gaussian), so
  t^{-d/2} must come from the energy-surface curvature det Ω. This is AFTER the semiclassical
  reduction has already been done — not the natural starting point.
- Action-angle indeterminacy (ΔI·Δθ ≥ ℏ/2) is a consequence of quantization (canonical
  commutation relations), not a direct output of the composition law (C).

**Physicist's addition:** There is one case where action-angle IS the natural home for
composition: the TORUS QUANTIZATION problem (Bohr-Sommerfeld). The quantization condition
I = ℏ·m DOES follow from requiring single-valuedness of K_t under θ → θ+2π — a composition
constraint (K_t must be periodic). This is a minor exception to §7's conclusion.

### P9.3: Two-agent status

**TWO-AGENT COMPLETE:** Mathematician (§1-8) + Physicist (§9).
Sev-3 (clarification; no new results beyond the label fix in §6). Ready for promotion to
action-angle indeterminacy notebook or Thread 10 seed note.

## 10. Critic Assessment
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-20 -->

**Verdict: CORRECT. Sev-3 (clarification, no new results).**

### C1: Angle integral trivial (§2) — CORRECT
The pure-phase integral over T^n gives (2pi)^n; no Gaussian mechanism, no t^{-n/2}.
The normalization equation N(t1+t2) = N(t1)*N(t2) has only exponential solutions.

### C2: Van Vleck det = 1 (§4) — CORRECT
-d^2S/dI_j dtheta'_k = delta_jk for S_cl = -H(I)t + I(theta-theta'). Standard.
The t^{-n/2} arises from the energy Hessian t*Omega_jk, not the angle-action VV matrix.

### C3: Main conclusion (§7) — ENDORSED
P4.2 forcing is transparent in position-space (Gaussian integral generates t^{-d/2}).
In action-angle, the forcing is hidden behind the energy-surface curvature det Omega.
Correctly stated as a representation-dependence observation, not a weakness of P4.2.

### C4: Physicist's Bohr-Sommerfeld exception (§9.2) — NOTED
Single-valuedness K_t(theta+2pi) = K_t(theta) as a composition constraint on T^n is correct.
This gives I = hbar*m — a quantization condition from periodicity. Minor exception, properly scoped.

THREE-AGENT COMPLETE: Mathematician (§1-8) + Physicist (§9) + Critic (§10). Sev-3.
