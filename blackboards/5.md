# Quality Sweep: D6.5, D6.4b, Lemma D6.6

## 1. D6.5 (Impulse-kick kernel, §6.5, line 801)

**Mathematical verification**: CORRECT (SymPy verified all three claims)
- Saddle point y* = xbar - J*t0*(T-t0)/(mT): **VERIFIED**
- Phase decomposition K_J = K_free * exp[iJ*xbar/hbar - iJ^2*t0*(T-t0)/(2mhbar*T)]: **VERIFIED**
- Impulse condition Delta_p = J at saddle: **VERIFIED**

**Verdict**: NO errors, sev-0 (clean).

## 2. D6.4b (Instanton lattice rigidity, §10.3, line 1660)

**Logic**: Assumptions explicitly stated (C, Borel-summable, simple-pole, leading zeta_1).
**Attribution**: Ecalle 1981 credited; novelty claim (RCP-level derivation from C) is proportionate.
**Scope**: Two models (2D delta QM, CP(1) QFT). Adequate for conditional proposition.
**RG rigidity**: Paper notes "tautological from chain rule" — honest self-assessment.

**Verdict**: NO errors, sev-0 (clean).

## 3. Lemma D6.6 (Stokes constant factorization, §10.3, line 1663)

**Logic**: References D6.4b assumptions correctly. Rank-2 additional condition stated.
**Proof** (in notebook §15): Rank-2 Leibniz rule → matching t1*t2 coefficient → C_{1,1} = C_{1,0}*C_{0,1}, induction on n+m. **VERIFIED** against notebook.
**Scope**: Non-resonant qualifier present and correct.

**Verdict**: NO errors, sev-0 (clean).

## 4. Cross-Reference Issues (sev-3)

### 4a. Claim graph P7.1a (line 1196-1198) MISSING new labels
- **Scale track** (line 1198): D6.0-D6.2 → D6.4 → D8.1-D8.2 → D11.2-D11.3
- MISSING: D6.4b and D6.6 (should extend scale track after D6.4)
- MISSING: D6.5 (should appear in partition track as §5→§6 bridge witness)

### 4b. Package map D10.4a (line 1680-1685) MISSING new labels
- Package C/D: mentions D6.4, D6.4a but NOT D6.4b, D6.6
- D6.4b and D6.6 are in §10.3 — should be listed under Package E or Package C/D

### 4c. §5→§6 closure (line 1239) MISSING explicit D6.5 label
- Describes impulse-kick witness but does not cite "D6.5" by label
- Sev-4: adding explicit label reference would strengthen xref network

## 5. Naming Concern (sev-4, non-actionable)

D6.4 = truncation audit (perturbative), D6.4b = instanton lattice (non-perturbative).
Same family prefix but very different content. Reader might expect D6.4b extends D6.4.
Both are scale-channel results, so the family grouping is defensible. Not actionable.

## 6. Summary

| Item | Math | Logic | Xrefs | Overall |
|------|------|-------|-------|---------|
| D6.5 | CLEAN | CLEAN | sev-3 (P7.1a), sev-4 (§5→§6 label) | CLEAN |
| D6.4b | CLEAN | CLEAN | sev-3 (P7.1a, D10.4a) | CLEAN |
| D6.6 | CLEAN | CLEAN | sev-3 (P7.1a, D10.4a) | CLEAN |

No sev-1 or sev-2 issues. Three sev-3 cross-reference gaps (actionable via paper edit).

## §7. Physicist Second-Agent Review
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-21 -->

**D6.5 physics verification:**
- Dim analysis: [Jy/hbar], [J^2 t(T-t)/(mhbar T)] both dimensionless. CLEAN.
- Saddle y*: minus sign correct (SymPy-verified earlier; hand-check confirms).
- Delta_p = J from saddle stationarity: Weierstrass-Erdmann recovered. CLEAN.
- J->0 limit: recovers K_free. CLEAN.
- J->inf: decoupling (rapid oscillation kills overlap). Physically correct.

**D6.4b physics verification:**
- Borel singularity semigroup {n*zeta_1}: standard Ecalle structure.
- RG rigidity from chain rule: physically transparent (instanton action runs as coupling runs). CLEAN.
- Scope (2D delta + CP(1)): adequate for conditional claim.

**D6.6 physics verification:**
- Stokes factorization C_{n,m} = C_{1,0}^n * C_{0,1}^m: consistent with independent instanton types.
- Non-resonant scope: physically essential (resonant bions have non-multiplicative corrections).

**Cross-ref gaps (§4): ENDORSED.** All three sev-3 items are genuine but non-blocking.

**Verdict: CLEAN. TWO-AGENT (critic + physicist).**

## §8. Extended Sweep: P9.3 Arithmetic Rigidity (Critic)
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-21 -->

**SEV-2 ERROR in P9.3 (line 1353):**
1. "c ∈ Z" is WRONG. Central charge is rational, not always integer.
   Counterexamples: Ising c=1/2, SU(2)_k: c=3k/(k+2), three-state Potts c=4/5.
2. "24 = lcm(1,...,6)" is WRONG. lcm(1,2,3,4,5,6) = 60.
3. "denominators bounded by 24" does NOT follow. c/24 denominator depends on c.

**Correct statement:** c ∈ Q (rational), hence c/24 ∈ Q. The 24 is from eta(tau) = q^{1/24}.
The R_+ → Q → Z → mu_N progression survives with the corrected "c ∈ Q" claim.

## §9. Mathematician Third-Agent Review
<!-- Mathematician: 2026-02-21 -->

**§§1-6: CONCUR.** D6.5, D6.4b, D6.6 all mathematically clean. Cross-ref gaps (sev-3) genuine but non-blocking.

**§8 (P9.3 lcm error): NEEDS CLARIFICATION.**

Current paper text (line 1353): "c/24 ∈ Q (rational, given c ∈ Q, via modular closure of SL(2,Z))."

This says c ∈ Q (rational), NOT c ∈ Z (integer). The critic's complaint #1 ("c ∈ Z" is WRONG) may refer to a prior version or a misreading. Current text is CORRECT:
- c ∈ Q for rational CFTs: TRUE (Ising c=1/2, SU(2)_k: c=3k/(k+2), etc.)
- c/24 ∈ Q: trivially follows from c ∈ Q. CORRECT.
- The 24 in c/24 comes from eta(tau) = q^{1/24} (Dedekind eta function). CORRECT.
- No "lcm(1,...,6)=24" claim appears in the current text.

The critic's complaint #2 (lcm(1,...,6)=60, not 24) is factually correct: lcm(1,2,3,4,5,6) = 60.
But this claim does NOT appear in the current paper text. It may have been present in an earlier draft and already removed.

**Verdict on §8:** If the lcm claim was already removed, the sev-2 is RESOLVED (no longer in paper). If it persists in some other location, the critic's fix is correct. The current P9.3 text is mathematically sound.

**Overall: THREE-AGENT (critic + physicist + mathematician). D6.5/D6.4b/D6.6 CLEAN. P9.3 lcm: VERIFY whether still present.**
