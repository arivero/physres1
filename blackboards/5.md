# Anomalies as Half-Density Composition Defects (S210)
Date: 2026-02-13
Open question #5: what is the "uncuttable" content of anomalies?

## 1. Standard anomaly story (already in manuscripts)

Uncuttable Remark 4.5: anomalies are topological constraints on the
refinement limit. No single regulator preserves all classical symmetries;
the anomaly coefficient e²/(16π²) is universal (index theorem).

Fermionic Remark 6.6: 't Hooft anomaly matching as RG invariant. UV
anomaly coefficients = IR anomaly coefficients. Constrains fermion-to-
composite chain via Wess-Zumino-Witten term.

## 2. RCP reframing: anomaly = composition-law defect

The core composition law for propagators:
  K(3,1) = ∫ K(3,2) K(2,1) d(measure at 2)

requires a CANONICAL measure at the intermediate point. For bosonic fields,
the half-density normalization provides this (HD-QFT §2, identity kernel).

For fermionic fields (Berezin integration), a symmetry G acts on kernels:
  K → K^G.

If G commutes with composition:
  [∫ K(3,2) K(2,1)]^G = ∫ K^G(3,2) K^G(2,1)
then G is non-anomalous (it respects the sewing operation).

If G does NOT commute with composition, the defect = anomaly:
  [∫ K K]^G = ∫ K^G K^G × exp(i × anomaly × θ)

## 3. Connection to Fujikawa's derivation

Fujikawa (1979): the fermion measure D[ψ̄]D[ψ] is built from the
eigenmodes φ_n of the Dirac operator. Under chiral rotation
ψ → e^{iθγ₅}ψ, the measure transforms:

  D[ψ̄]D[ψ] → D[ψ̄]D[ψ] × exp(-2iθ × index(D̸))

The index = n₊ - n₋ (difference in zero-mode chiralities).

In half-density language: the fermionic path integral "measure" is a
section of a determinant line bundle over field space. Its transformation
under chiral rotations is determined by the spectral asymmetry of D̸.
The half-density (square root of the functional determinant) is NOT
chirally invariant, and the AMOUNT of non-invariance is topological.

## 4. The three-level diagnostic

| Level | Question | Answer |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1. Conceptual | Does RCP reframe anomalies cleanly? | YES: anomaly = failure of symmetry to commute with the composition/sewing operation |
| 2. Geometric | Does half-density viewpoint localize the anomaly? | PARTIALLY: anomaly lives in the Jacobian of the intermediate-point measure transformation. This is Fujikawa in geometric dress. |
| 3. New constraints | Does this produce predictions beyond standard anomaly matching? | NO: the constraints are already captured by index theorem + 't Hooft matching. No new quantitative content. |

## 5. What the half-density program specifically adds

(a) BOSONIC composition is anomaly-free because the half-density weight
    (|det g|^{1/4} at each point) transforms as a scalar density under
    coordinate changes — no topological obstruction.

(b) FERMIONIC composition has a potential anomaly because the fermionic
    "half-density" (det D̸)^{1/2} has a PHASE that depends on the
    spectral asymmetry. This phase is the eta-invariant (APS, 1975).

(c) The anomaly coefficient is the INDEX of the Dirac operator, which is
    a topological invariant of the background gauge field. This is why
    anomaly matching is an exact RG invariant: the index is independent
    of the metric/regulator, depending only on topology.

(d) **Key sentence for a potential remark**: "The chiral anomaly is the
    topological obstruction to extending the half-density composition
    law from bosonic to fermionic fields while preserving chiral symmetry."

## 6. Honest verdict

RCP provides a CLEANER GEOMETRIC LANGUAGE for anomalies (composition-law
defect, half-density Jacobian) but does NOT generate new constraints.
The standard anomaly-matching story is already complete.

The uncuttable Remark 4.5 covers the standard material well. The only
gap is the explicit half-density connection (§5 above), which could be
a 2-sentence addendum to the HD-QFT paper's §7 (BV outlook) if space
permits — but HD-QFT is at 234 lines (4pp), so this is marginal.

**Recommendation**: update motivations.md question #5 status to
"partially resolved — conceptual reframing only, no new constraints."
Do NOT force a promotion cycle; the material is honest but thin.
