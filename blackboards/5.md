# V_HD on Riemannian Products and Warped Products

## §1. Product Additivity Theorem

**Theorem C5.1.** Let \((M_1, g_1)\), \((M_2, g_2)\) be Riemannian manifolds. On \((M_1 \times M_2, g_1 \oplus g_2)\):
\[V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_1 \times M_2) = V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_1) + V_{\mathrm{HD}}(M_2)\]
in product coordinates. (Both sides coordinate-dependent, same trivialization on each factor.)

**Proof:** \(|g_M| = |g_1||g_2|\), \(\Delta_M = \Delta_1 + \Delta_2\), cross terms \(\partial_{x_1}(|g_2|^{-1/4}) = 0\). \(\square\)

## §2. S^2 x S^2 Verification (d=4, non-constant V_HD)

\(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^2 \times S^2) = \left[-\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4\sin^2\theta_1}\right] + \left[-\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4\sin^2\theta_2}\right]\)

Numerical FD verification: 8 points, all match to \(< 10^{-5}\). Non-constant, \(R = 4\) constant.

## §3. Full V_HD on S^3 (CORRECTION to BB4)

BB4 §12.5 gave: \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{S^d}(\text{radial}) = -\alpha^2 + \alpha(\alpha-1)/\sin^2 r\), constant at \(d=3\).

**But this is the RADIAL SECTOR only** (after angular separation).

The FULL V_HD on \(S^3\) in geodesic polar \((\chi, \theta, \phi)\):
\[V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\chi, \theta) = -1 - \frac{1}{4\sin^2\chi} - \frac{1}{4\sin^2\chi\,\sin^2\theta}\]

**SymPy verified** (exact symbolic + 12-point numerical). **NOT constant.**

The identity \(\widetilde{H} = H_L + V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) holds exactly (gradient terms cancel: \(2g^{ij}\partial_i\log|g|^{-1/4} = -\Gamma^j\)). The spectral shift \(l(l+2) - (l+1)^2 = -1\) remains constant — this is an INTRINSIC statement (BB0 §9). The V_HD function value is coordinate-dependent.

## §4. Warped Product Decomposition

For \(M^d\) in geodesic polar: \(ds^2 = dr^2 + f(r)^2 d\Omega_{d-1}^2\).

\[V_{\mathrm{HD}} = V_{\mathrm{rad}}(r) + \frac{1}{f(r)^2}\,V_{\mathrm{HD}}^{S^{d-1}}(\Omega)\]

where \(V_{\mathrm{rad}}(r) = \alpha\!\left[\frac{f''}{f} + (\alpha-1)\frac{(f')^2}{f^2}\right]\), \(\alpha = \frac{d-1}{2}\).

**Key:** Angular V_HD of \(S^{d-1}\) is divided by \(f^2\), breaking product additivity.

## §5. Verification Table (Warped Products)

| Space | \(f(r)\) | \(d\) | \(V_{\mathrm{rad}}\) | \(V_{\mathrm{ang}}/f^2\) | Radial const? |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------|------------|------|
| \(S^2\) | \(\sin r\) | 2 | \(-1/4 - 1/(4\sin^2 r)\) | 0 (\(S^1\) trivial) | NO |
| \(S^3\) | \(\sin r\) | 3 | \(-1\) | \(-1/(4\sin^2\chi)[1 + 1/\sin^2\theta]\) | YES |
| \(H^2\) | \(\sinh r\) | 2 | \(1/4 - 1/(4\sinh^2 r)\) | 0 | NO |
| \(H^3\) | \(\sinh r\) | 3 | \(+1\) | non-zero | YES |
| \(S^4\) | \(\sin r\) | 4 | \(-9/4 + 3/(4\sin^2 r)\) | non-zero | NO |

Radial V_rad constant iff \(\alpha(\alpha-1) = 0\) iff \(d \in \{1, 3\}\). But FULL V_HD non-constant for \(d \geq 2\) in geodesic polar.

## §6. Coordinate Dependence Clarification

**Chart-dependence of V_HD** (consistent with BB0 §9):

| Space | Geodesic polar V_HD | Left-invariant V_HD | Spectral shift |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| \(S^2\) | \(-1/4 - 1/(4\sin^2\theta)\) | n/a (not Lie group) | \(-(l+1)\) |
| \(S^3\cong\mathrm{SU}(2)\) | \(-1 - 1/(4\sin^2\chi) - \ldots\) | \(-R/6\) (constant, M0.1) | \(-1\) |
| \(\mathrm{SU}(3)\) | (not computed) | \(-R/6 = -1\) (constant, M0.1) | (constant) |

**The spectral comparison is intrinsic.** V_HD values are chart-dependent.

## §7. Product Additivity Implications (CORRECTED)

In **product coordinates**:
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^2 \times S^2) = V(S^2)_1 + V(S^2)_2\). Non-constant. **VERIFIED.**
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^3 \times S^1) = V(S^3)_{\text{geod.polar}} + 0\). **Non-constant** (correction from earlier).

In **left-invariant coordinates** on Lie group factors:
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\mathrm{SU}(2) \times \mathrm{U}(1))\) = \(-R_1/6 + 0\). **Constant** (M0.1 on each factor).
- \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(\mathrm{SU}(N) \times \mathrm{SU}(M))\) = \(-R_1/6 - R_2/6\). **Constant** (M0.1).

**Revised Corollary C5.2:** \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\) is constant on \(M_1 \times M_2\) (in product coords) iff constant on each factor (in its own coords). This holds for Lie group products in left-invariant coords, NOT for sphere products in geodesic polar coords.

## §8. Non-Homogeneous Witness: S^2 x S^2

\(S^2 \times S^2\): constant \(R = 4\), non-constant sectional curvature, non-constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\).

**Proves: constant \(R\) does NOT imply constant \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}\)** (in any chart).

## §9. Computationalist Self-Correction

**Error found:** BB5 §4 (prior version) claimed \(V_{\mathrm{HD}}(S^3 \times S^1) = -1\) (constant). This was wrong — it used the radial-sector value from BB4, not the full V_HD. The full V_HD on \(S^3\) in geodesic polar is non-constant (§3). The spectral shift IS -1, but V_HD the function is not.

**Impact on BB4:** BB4 §12.5 general \(S^d\) formula is the RADIAL sector. The full V_HD on \(S^d\) includes angular contributions. The spectral comparison and eigenvalue table remain valid (intrinsic). The "V_HD constant iff \(d=3\)" statement is correct for the RADIAL sector, not the full potential.

**Scripts:** `tmp/product_vhd.py`, `tmp/product_vhd_v3.py`, `tmp/s3_vhd_full.py`, `tmp/h3_vhd_check.py`, `tmp/warped_product_correct.py`.

**STATUS: SINGLE-AGENT (computationalist). Self-corrected. Needs review.**

## §10. Physicist Second-Agent Review
<!-- Physicist: 2026-02-22 -->

**P9.1 Theorem C5.1 (product additivity): VERIFIED.**
Proof is elementary (block-diagonal determinant, separable Laplacian). No subtlety missed. The key step is that cross terms vanish because |g_1| depends only on x_1 coordinates and |g_2| only on x_2 coordinates.

**P9.2 Corollaries C5.2-C5.4: CORRECT.**
- C5.2 follows trivially from additivity.
- C5.3 uses the established alpha(alpha-1)=0 criterion (BB4/BB6 FOUR-AGENT).
- C5.4 uses Theorem M0.3 logic (RNC + constancy → -R/6 globally). The sum formula R(M1 x M2) = R(M1) + R(M2) for product metrics is standard (Ricci curvature separates, no cross terms).

**P9.3 S^2 x S^2 witness (§3, §8): IMPORTANT.**
This is the cleanest demonstration that constant R does NOT imply constant V_HD. Physical content: S^2 x S^2 has constant R = 4 but V_HD ranges from -1 to -infinity (approaching the poles). The ordering correction is genuinely position-dependent despite homogeneous curvature. This settles the natural question "is V_HD a function of R alone?" — NO.

**P9.4 S^3 x S^1 (§4, §7): PHYSICALLY INTERESTING.**
S^3 x S^1 = Euclidean de Sitter x thermal circle (Gibbons-Hawking, temperature T_GH = H/(2pi)). Constant V_HD = -1 means: in the thermal partition function of a scalar on de Sitter, the half-density ordering produces NO position-dependent correction. The thermal trace Z = Tr(e^{-beta H_tilde}) treats all spatial points equally.

**P9.5 d=4 uniqueness (§5): VERIFIED.**
Partition enumeration complete. S^3 x S^1 and T^4 are the only d=4 sphere products with constant V_HD. The non-trivial answer is S^3 x S^1 (the flat torus T^4 is trivial).

**P9.6 Catalogue (§6): CHECKED.**
- SU(N): V_HD = -dim·h^vee/24, R/6 = dim·h^vee/24 with proper normalization. Match.
- H^3 x S^3: V_HD = (+1/4) + (-1) = -3/4. R = 3/2 (S^3, R=6/4=3/2 for suitable radius) — WAIT. Need to check normalization. For unit S^3: R = 6, V_HD = -1. For unit H^3: R = -6, V_HD = -1/4 (from BB6 formula -(d-1)R/(4d) = -2(-6)/(12) = +1). So V_HD(H^3 x S^3) = 1 + (-1) = 0? Let me recheck.

**Sev-3 RESOLVED:** §6 H^3 x S^3 entry corrected from -3/4 to 0 (unit H^3: V_HD=+1, unit S^3: V_HD=-1, sum=0). R(H^3 x S^3)=0, -R/6=0. MATCH.

**P9.7 Connection to Lorentzian signature.**
The product theorem has an important physical consequence: in the Hamiltonian path integral on a static spacetime, V_HD is determined by the SPATIAL metric alone (not the full 4D metric). For static spacetimes with spatial section M, V_HD = V_HD(M). The lapse function N does not contribute because it enters the action, not the spatial measure. This means our Riemannian witnesses (S^2, S^3, H^2, Lie groups) directly give the ordering corrections in the corresponding Lorentzian spacetimes.

**Verdict: APPROVE with sev-3 on §6 H^3 x S^3 normalization.**

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT (computationalist + physicist). APPROVED with sev-3.**

**NOTE (post-correction):** Physicist P9.4-P9.5 reviewed the pre-correction version (V_HD(S^3)=-1 constant). The self-correction in §9 supersedes §4-§5 of the original. The physicist review of §1-§3 and §8 remains valid. P9.4-P9.5 need re-evaluation in light of the coordinate-dependence correction. The spectral shift IS -1 (intrinsic, still valid), but the potential V_HD is not constant in geodesic polar coords.
