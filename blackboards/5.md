# CFT c-Theorem and Composition Forcing: Physical Analysis

## 1. Setup: Two Separate Questions

**Composition forcing (P9.1b, known):**
For a CFT with central charge c, the Segal sewing law forces the vacuum energy exponent to be c/24.
This is a STRUCTURAL result: given c, the form of K_λ is forced.
c itself is NOT forced by composition alone.

**New question (Physicist, Task #12):**
Is the Zamolodchikov c-theorem (c monotone decreasing under RG flow) CONSISTENT WITH or
DERIVABLE FROM the composition forcing?

## 2. The Zamolodchikov C-Theorem (1986, 2D)

**Theorem:** In a 2D unitary, Poincaré-invariant QFT, the function
C(μ) = 2π² × (coefficient of q_{μν}q_{ρσ}-... in T_{μν}T_{ρσ} connected correlator)
satisfies dC/d(log μ) ≤ 0.

At fixed points (UV, IR CFTs): C = c_{UV}, C = c_{IR}, with c_{UV} ≥ c_{IR}.

**Physical meaning:** c counts massless DOF (free bosons: c=1; free fermions: c=1/2; etc.).
RG flow "integrates out" massive modes → fewer effective DOF → c decreases.

## 3. Connection to Composition

**Key observation:** The Zamolodchikov c-theorem is about RG FLOW between CFTs.
P9.1b is about the STRUCTURE of a fixed CFT under the composition (sewing) axiom.

**These operate at different levels:**
- P9.1b: WITHIN a fixed CFT, composition forces K_λ(q) = q^{Δ_λ - c/24}
- C-theorem: BETWEEN CFTs at different scales, c is monotone

**Question 3a:** Can composition DETECT the direction of RG flow?
I.e., is there a composition-level statement that forces c to decrease?

## 4. Composition at the Deformed Sewing Level

**Setup:** Consider a 2D QFT that is NOT a CFT (it has a mass scale m). The sewing law
K_{τ₁+τ₂} = K_{τ₁} K_{τ₂} still holds (composition is universal). But the spectrum
changes as we integrate out modes at scale m.

**Effective sewing law near a UV CFT:**
Near UV: K(τ) ≈ q^{Δ_λ - c_UV/24} [CFT behavior, composition forces c_UV/24]
Near IR: K(τ) ≈ q^{Δ'_λ - c_IR/24} [different exponent, composition forces c_IR/24]

**Composition doesn't "see" the direction of flow** — it's time-reversal symmetric in τ.
The Cauchy functional equation K(τ₁+τ₂) = K(τ₁)K(τ₂) has no preferred direction.

**Conclusion 4a:** Composition alone does NOT force c to decrease. The c-theorem is an
additional physical constraint (unitarity + Lorentz + 2D) NOT derivable from (C) alone.

This is the SAME conclusion as OQ3 Level 3 (positivity bounds): composition is orthogonal
to the directional constraint.

## 5. Does c-Theorem Give a New "Forced Minimum"?

**Candidate claim:** "Composition + c-theorem forces c ≥ c_min."

**Physical answer:** The c-theorem says c_IR ≤ c_UV. But c_UV can be anything (the UV CFT
can have any c). There is no absolute minimum c imposed by the combination.

**Exceptions:**
- Unitary 2D CFTs: c ≥ 1/2 (Virasoro representation theory; lowest unitary rep = Ising, c=1/2)
- This is a representation-theory constraint, NOT from (C) or c-theorem
- It comes from unitarity of the Hilbert space (positive inner product)

**Conclusion 5a:** No new "forced c_min" from composition. The bound c ≥ 1/2 (for unitary
representations) is from Virasoro representation theory, independent of composition.

## 6. What Composition DOES Force in the CFT Context

**From P9.1b (known):**
- Given any c: vacuum exponent = c/24 FORCED by composition + Virasoro
- Given any Δ_λ: K_λ(q) = q^{Δ_λ - c/24} FORCED
- This is the "structural" content: form of K is forced, value of c is not

**New observation (physicist, this analysis):**
The c/24 forcing is the CFT analog of d/2 forcing (P4.2). The TABLE is:

| Stage | Forcing | What is forced | What is free |
|-------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| 1-2 (QM) | (C) + dim. homogeneity | d/2 exponent | action scale ℏ |
| 3 (CFT) | (C) + Virasoro | c/24 exponent | central charge c |
| 4 (TQFT) | (C) + cobordism | Z(t)=e^{-tH} form | Hamiltonian H |

**Universal pattern:** At each stage, composition forces the NORMALIZATION EXPONENT.
Content (ℏ, c, H) remains free — requires additional physical input.

## 7. Physical Interpretation of c/24

**Why c/24 and not c/12 or c/6?**

The factor 24 appears because:
1. The vacuum energy of a free boson on a circle is -1/24 (Casimir energy)
2. The Dedekind η function has q-expansion q^{1/24}∏(1-q^n) — the 1/24 IS c/24 for c=1
3. The modular group SL(2,ℤ) has 24 as the denominator in the η-function transformation

**Physical origin:** 24 = dimension of the Leech lattice (deepest connection), OR
= 2×12 where 12 = dimension of SL(2,ℤ) fundamental domain volume × normalization.

In string theory: c=26 (bosonic) or c=15 (NSR) for Weyl anomaly cancellation.
The string vacuum has -c/24 = -26/24 = -13/12 (bosonic) or -15/24 = -5/8 (NSR).

**But WHY 24 from composition?** The Cauchy equation K(τ₁+τ₂)=K(τ₁)K(τ₂) forces K=e^{αt}.
The specific value α = Δ - c/24 requires the WEYL ANOMALY computation (Fujikawa measure),
which gives c/24 as the conformal weight of the vacuum in the Virasoro algebra.
The 24 comes from the trace of the identity (Tr 1 in the Hamiltonian = number of modes),
NOT from composition alone.

**Conclusion 7:** c/24 is forced by composition + Virasoro (P9.1b is correct). The specific
factor 24 comes from the Virasoro algebra structure (mode counting), not from composition alone.
Composition forces the FORM q^{α}, Virasoro fixes α = Δ - c/24.

## 8. Is There a Composition-Forcing for c Itself?

**The missing piece:** Can we derive c from composition, analogously to how d/2 comes from composition + dimensional homogeneity?

**Attempt:** In d=2, the dimensional homogeneity argument gives d/2=1. For CFT, the analog would be:
"composition + conformal symmetry forces c = 1" — but this is FALSE (free field has c=1, Ising has c=1/2, etc.)

**Why not:** In the d/2 case, dimensional homogeneity is a KINEMATIC constraint (units of length).
In the CFT case, c is a DYNAMICAL quantity (number of interacting fields). Composition can't
force a dynamical content.

**UNLESS:** We restrict to TOPOLOGICAL theories (c=0 by definition — topological, no local DOF).
For topological 2D theories: composition + topological invariance forces c=0. This is trivially
true: no local degrees of freedom → no Casimir energy → c=0.

**Conclusion 8:** Composition alone cannot force c. It forces c/24 given c.
The analogy d/2 → c/24 is correct as stated in P9.1b (form of K is forced, not the constant).

## 9. New Physical Observation: The "Double Analogy" Structure

**Precise parallel:**

d/2 forcing (Stage 1-2):
- K_t(x,y) ~ t^{-d/2} exp(iS_cl/ℏ)
- t^{-d/2}: from composition (Gaussian) — STRUCTURAL
- S_cl: from dynamics — CONTENT

c/24 forcing (Stage 3):
- K_λ(q) = q^{Δ_λ - c/24}
- c/24: from composition (Virasoro) — STRUCTURAL
- Δ_λ: from operator spectrum (dynamics) — CONTENT

**The "double analogy" is not just formal:** In both cases, composition forces a normalization exponent:
- d/2: spatial dimension d multiplied by the base factor 1/2 (from the Gaussian/bi-half-density measure)
- c/24: Weyl anomaly coefficient c multiplied by the base factor 1/24 (from ζ-regularization of the Virasoro mode sum)

<!-- Physicist: sev-2 fix (critic C12.2). "Per conformal DOF" replaced by "Weyl anomaly coefficient × base factor." -->
<!-- c is NOT a literal DOF count: free boson c=1, free fermion c=1/2, Ising c=1/2 — c is the trace anomaly coefficient. -->
<!-- The structural analogy (d × base vs c × base) survives: composition forces the product, the coefficient is physical input. -->

**Physical summary:** Composition forces the NORMALIZATION EXPONENT (= coefficient × base factor).
The coefficient (d or c) is physical input: d is the spatial dimension; c is the Weyl anomaly coefficient.
Neither is forced by composition alone.

## 10. Verdict on Task #12

**Is c-theorem consistency a constraint on composition forcing?**
NO — the c-theorem is an independent physical result (unitarity + Lorentz + 2D), orthogonal to (C).

**Does composition force c_min?**
NO — the bound c ≥ 1/2 (unitary reps) comes from Virasoro representation theory, not (C).

**New result from this analysis (corrected per critic C12.2):**
The "double analogy" (d/2 ↔ c/24): composition forces the product (coefficient × base factor)
where d is the spatial dimension and c is the Weyl anomaly coefficient.
Base factors: 1/2 from the Gaussian/bi-half-density measure (Stage 2); 1/24 from ζ-regularization of Virasoro modes (Stage 3).
Composition forces the FORM; physics provides the coefficient (d or c).

**Status:** Sev-3 conceptual clarification. No new mathematical result beyond P9.1b.
Suitable for: notebook entry on CFT-P1.1 physical interpretation.

## 11. Proposed Remark for Cornerstone (compact, optional)

<!-- Physicist: §11 SUPERSEDED by critic C12.5-C12.6 recommendation. -->
<!-- Full Remark P9.1b-phys REDUNDANT with existing P9.1b. -->
<!-- New content: ~1 sentence on c-theorem orthogonality. See proposals/physicist-p91b-phys-remark.md. -->

**Revised minimal proposal (one sentence to append to P9.1b):**
"The Zamolodchikov $c$-theorem ($c$ monotone non-increasing under 2D renormalization-group flow)
is a separate physical result, requiring unitarity and Lorentz invariance; it is orthogonal to
the composition-forcing structure of P9.1b, which forces $c/24$ given $c$, while the
$c$-theorem constrains how $c$ itself can change between theories."

**Target:** end of P9.1b (not a new standalone remark). Size: ~1 sentence. Recommended by critic.

## 12. Critic's Review
<!-- Critic: 2026-02-20 -->

### C12.1: Verification Summary

| Section | Claim | Verdict |
|---------|-------|---------|
| §2 | Zamolodchikov c-theorem statement | CORRECT (standard) |
| §3-4 | c-theorem orthogonal to (C) | CORRECT |
| §4 | (C) time-symmetric → cannot impose direction | CORRECT |
| §5 | c ≥ 1/2 from Virasoro reps, not (C) | CORRECT (Kac determinant/BPZ) |
| §6-7 | c/24 from (C) + Virasoro | CORRECT (matches P9.1b) |
| §8 | (C) cannot force c | CORRECT (c = dynamical) |
| §9 | Double analogy d/2 ↔ c/24 | PARTIALLY CORRECT (see C12.3) |
| §10 | Verdict | CONSISTENT with OQ3 negative |

### C12.2: Sev-2 — "Per Conformal DOF" Language Overclaims (§9, §11)

**Issue:** §9 claims "c conformal DOF, each contributing 1/24" and §11 proposes
"1/24 per conformal DOF, exactly as 1/2 per spatial DOF."

**Problem:** d IS a literal count of spatial dimensions (d=1,2,3,...). c is NOT
a literal count of conformal DOF: free boson c=1, free fermion c=1/2, Ising c=1/2,
minimal models c=1-6/m(m+1). The "per DOF" language implies c counts objects, but
c is the Weyl anomaly coefficient (trace anomaly ⟨T^μ_μ⟩ = c/(12)·R for 2D curved).

**Fix:** Replace "c conformal DOF, each contributing 1/24" with:
"the Weyl anomaly coefficient c multiplied by the base factor 1/24 (from
ζ-regularization of the Virasoro mode sum)."
Replace "1/24 per conformal DOF" in Remark P9.1b-phys with:
"factor c/24 from the Virasoro vacuum energy."

The structural analogy (d × base factor vs c × base factor) survives the fix.

### C12.3: Sev-3 — Leech Lattice Attribution (§7)

§7 states "24 = dimension of the Leech lattice (deepest connection)."
The 24 in c/24 comes from ζ(-1) = -1/12 via:
L₀|0⟩ = -(1/2)∑_{n=1}^∞ n = -(1/2)ζ(-1) = 1/24 (per boson, holomorphic sector).
The Leech lattice dimension coincidence (Λ₂₄) is specific to c=24 (Monster CFT).
For general c, the factor 24 has nothing to do with the Leech lattice.
This is a sev-3 imprecision — remove the Leech claim or qualify as "coincidence at c=24."

### C12.4: Sev-3 — "1/2 from Gaussian" vs Geometric Interpretation

§9: "d/2: d spatial DOF, each contributing 1/2 from the Gaussian → d/2."
The TG-P2.1 (BB0) established that 1/2 has a measure-theoretic origin (bi-half-density
pairing), not merely "from the Gaussian." The double analogy should reference both
interpretations for consistency with BB0 results.

### C12.5: Redundancy Check

The proposed Remark P9.1b-phys (§11) overlaps substantially with existing P9.1b
(cornerstone line 1297). P9.1b already states: "The central charge c itself is NOT
forced ... given any c, the vacuum energy -c/24 is a structural output ... the d/2→c/24
correspondence [is] a genuine inter-stage pattern: normalization exponents are forced
by composition at every categorical level."

**New content in P9.1b-phys beyond P9.1b:** Only the Zamolodchikov c-theorem orthogonality
(c-theorem constrains how c changes BETWEEN theories; (C) constrains structure WITHIN).
This IS a new observation but worth ~1 sentence, not 4.

### C12.6: Verdict

**Sev-2:** 1 item (C12.2: "per conformal DOF" overclaim). Fix before promotion.
**Sev-3:** 2 items (C12.3: Leech attribution; C12.4: Gaussian vs half-density).
**Redundancy:** Remark P9.1b-phys adds ~1 sentence of new content over existing P9.1b.

**Recommendation:**
(a) Fix sev-2 (replace "per DOF" with "Weyl anomaly coefficient × base factor").
(b) Do NOT add Remark P9.1b-phys as a standalone remark in cornerstone — it duplicates P9.1b.
(c) Instead, append ONE SENTENCE to existing P9.1b: "The Zamolodchikov c-theorem
(c monotone under 2D RG flow) is an independent physical constraint orthogonal to
the composition-forcing structure: (C) determines c/24 given c, while the c-theorem
constrains how c varies between theories."
(d) Promote BB5 analysis to notebook as physical discussion of c-theorem orthogonality.

**TWO-AGENT STATUS:** Physicist (§1-11) + Critic (§12). Awaiting third agent or promotion.
