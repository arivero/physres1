# Rooted Trees: Full Usage Map (ODE, QFT, QM, 0+0)

Research direction for future satellite D (Rooted Trees)

## The program
Explain ALL usages of rooted trees across the physics hierarchy:

1. **ODE (Butcher's B-series).** Rooted trees label the terms in the Taylor
   expansion of numerical ODE integrators. Butcher group = group of B-series.
   Connection to composition of methods, order conditions.

2. **QFT (Connes-Kreimer).** Rooted trees label Feynman diagrams (or classes
   thereof). Hopf algebra of renormalization: coproduct = subdivergence
   extraction, antipode = counterterm map. Birkhoff decomposition = MS-bar
   renormalization.

3. **0+1 QFT = Quantum Mechanics.** What is the rooted-tree structure for
   path integrals in quantum mechanics? The Trotter splitting (Remark 3.3 in
   uncuttable) is the simplest "tree" (linear chain). Higher-order splittings
   (Yoshida, Forest-Ruth) should correspond to specific tree structures.
   The BCH expansion organizes commutators by tree topology.

4. **0+0 QFT = statics (matrix models / finite-dim integrals).** What survives
   when there's no spacetime at all — pure statics? Perturbative expansion of
   matrix integrals in terms of ribbon graphs (fatted rooted trees). Connection
   to combinatorics of Gaussian integrals via Wick's theorem. The tree structure
   should already be visible here, stripped of all dynamical complications.

## Key reference to acquire
- **Alessandra Frabetti: coloured rooted trees.** Extends the Butcher/Connes-Kreimer
  framework with coloured trees. Need to download her papers.
  Search: Frabetti coloured rooted trees Hopf algebra.

## Structural question
The rooted-tree dictionary should show that the SAME combinatorial structure
(rooted trees + Hopf algebra) controls:
- Error terms in ODE solvers (Butcher)
- Counterterms in QFT renormalization (Connes-Kreimer)
- BCH commutators in operator splitting (Trotter/symplectic)
- Perturbative corrections in matrix models

This is the "refinement compatibility" principle in combinatorial dress:
the tree structure is the universal bookkeeping for composed approximations.
