# Critique: delta-objects satellite

## Severity-2: None found.

## Severity-3 (minor)

**S3.1 2D delta transmutation is fifth appearance in corpus**
- Also in rg-fundamental, rooted-tree-bookkeeping, planck-area, half-density-qft
- Presentation here connects naturally to rank-one kernel formalism; appropriate

**S3.2 Remark 5.1 unification claim is defensible**
- $d/2$ unifies: identity-kernel scaling, heat-kernel convergence, Sobolev embedding
- "One geometric fact, not three coincidences" — correct structural observation

**S3.3 Section 5 is appropriately cautious**
- "This note treats that identification as an organizing perspective, not as a theorem" (line 196)

## Algebra checks — all correct

- Near-diagonal scaling: $\varepsilon^{-d/2}\delta(v)$
- $\delta(f')$ change of variables: $\sum 1/|f''(x_i)|$
- $\delta'$ from point splitting: $-\varphi'(0) = \langle\delta',\varphi\rangle$
- Free-particle Van Vleck: $D = (m/\Delta t)^d$, $\sqrt{D} = (m/\Delta t)^{d/2}$
- Harmonic oscillator Van Vleck: $D = |m\omega/\sin\omega\Delta t|$; caustic at $\sin\omega\Delta t = 0$
- Heat kernel Laplace representation: $\int t^{-d/2}e^{-\kappa^2 t}dt = \Gamma(1-d/2)\kappa^{d-2}$; converges iff $d < 2$
- 2D bound state cancellation: $\kappa = \alpha$ from $\ln(\Lambda/\kappa)/\ln(\Lambda/\alpha) = 1$
- Self-adjoint extension dimension threshold: $d \leq 3$ from $H^2 \hookrightarrow C^0$ iff $2 \cdot 2 > d$

## Positive assessment

- Clean, focused dictionary paper — three uses of delta unified by half-density geometry
- Self-adjoint extension hierarchy (Remark 4.2) is well-cited and correctly presented
- Maslov index remark (3.5c) is a valuable pointer to the metaplectic structure
- References are authoritative (Albeverio et al, Derezinski 2024, Bates-Weinstein, Hormander)
- Overclaiming pattern absent — cautious framing throughout

## Verdict

No errors. Third-cleanest paper in the project (after planck-area and half-density-qft). Compact, well-organized, and mathematically correct. No changes recommended.
