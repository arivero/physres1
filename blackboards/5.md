# Action-Angle Indeterminacy: Mathematical Verification (Pre-Vote)

## 1. [L_z, E] = ℏE (§2, key commutation relation)

E = e^{iφ}, L_z = -iℏ∂_φ, acting on 2π-periodic functions.

[L_z, E]ψ = L_z(Eψ) - E(L_zψ)
           = -iℏ∂_φ(e^{iφ}ψ) - e^{iφ}(-iℏ∂_φψ)
           = -iℏ[ie^{iφ}ψ + e^{iφ}∂_φψ] + iℏe^{iφ}∂_φψ
           = -iℏ·ie^{iφ}ψ = ℏEψ  ✓

**V1.1 VERIFIED:** [L_z, E] = ℏE. ✓

## 2. Circular Uncertainty Relation (Proposition 4.2)

**Claim:** Var(L_z)·(1-R²) ≥ ℏ²R²/4, where R = |⟨e^{iφ}⟩|.

**Commutators (§4, using in derivation):**
[L_z, cos φ]ψ = -iℏ∂_φ(cos φ ψ) + iℏcos φ ∂_φψ = iℏ sin φ ψ ✓
[L_z, sin φ]ψ = -iℏ∂_φ(sin φ ψ) + iℏsin φ ∂_φψ = -iℏ cos φ ψ ✓

**Robertson applied to (L_z, cos φ) and (L_z, sin φ):**
Var(L_z)·Var(cos φ) ≥ (ℏ²/4)⟨sin φ⟩²
Var(L_z)·Var(sin φ) ≥ (ℏ²/4)⟨cos φ⟩²

**Adding (Var(L_z) is common factor):**
Var(L_z)[Var(cos φ) + Var(sin φ)] ≥ (ℏ²/4)[⟨sin φ⟩² + ⟨cos φ⟩²]

**Identities:**
Var(cos φ)+Var(sin φ) = ⟨cos²φ+sin²φ⟩ - (⟨cosφ⟩²+⟨sinφ⟩²) = 1 - R²
⟨sinφ⟩²+⟨cosφ⟩² = |⟨e^{iφ}⟩|² = R²

Therefore: Var(L_z)·(1-R²) ≥ ℏ²R²/4. ✓

**V2.1 VERIFIED:** Proposition 4.2 derivation is correct. ✓

**V2.2 FLAG (sev-3):** The Robertson inequality requires that the commutator
expectation value ⟨[L_z, cos φ]⟩ = iℏ⟨sin φ⟩ is well-defined. For L_z eigenstates
(where the LHS is trivial, R=0), this is fine — the bound becomes 0≥0.
The Robertson inequality also requires the state to be in the domain of both L_z
and of cos φ, sin φ (which is automatic for square-integrable 2π-periodic functions).
No issue. Sev-3 precision note only.

## 3. Example 4.3: Dirichlet-Kernel Packet Verification

ψ_M(φ) = (1/√(2π(2M+1))) Σ_{m=-M}^{M} e^{imφ}

In terms of normalized Fourier coefficients: c_m = 1/√(2M+1) for m ∈ {-M,...,M}.

**R = |⟨e^{iφ}⟩|:**
⟨e^{iφ}⟩ = Σ_{m,m': |m|,|m'|≤M} c_m^* c_{m'} δ_{m'+1,m'...}

More directly: ⟨e^{iφ}⟩ = Σ_{|m|≤M} |c_m|² δ... no.

Using Fourier: ⟨e^{iφ}⟩ = Σ_{|m|≤M, |m+1|≤M} |c_m|² ← wrong framing.

Correct: ⟨e^{iφ}⟩ = Σ_{|m|≤M} Σ_{|n|≤M} c_m^* c_n ∫ e^{iφ} e^{i(n-m)φ} dφ/(2π)
= Σ_{|m|≤M, |n|≤M} c_m^* c_n δ_{n-m,1}
= Σ_{|m|≤M, |m+1|≤M} |c_m|²  [with c_m=1/√(2M+1)]
= (1/(2M+1)) · #{m: |m|≤M and |m+1|≤M}
= (1/(2M+1)) · 2M  [m ranges from -M to M-1, giving 2M values]

So |⟨e^{iφ}⟩| = 2M/(2M+1). ✓ (matches paper)

**Var(L_z):**
⟨L_z⟩ = ℏ/(2M+1) · Σ_{m=-M}^{M} m = 0 (symmetric). ✓
⟨L_z²⟩ = ℏ²/(2M+1) · Σ_{m=-M}^{M} m² = ℏ²·2·M(M+1)(2M+1)/(6(2M+1)) = ℏ²M(M+1)/3. ✓
Var(L_z) = ℏ²M(M+1)/3. ✓

**Ratio computation:**
1-R² = 1-(2M/(2M+1))² = (4M+1)/(2M+1)²

LHS = Var(L_z)(1-R²) = ℏ²M(M+1)(4M+1)/(3(2M+1)²)
RHS = ℏ²R²/4 = ℏ²M²/(2M+1)²

Ratio = (M+1)(4M+1)/(3M). ✓

At M=1: 2·5/3 = 10/3 ≈ 3.33. ✓
Large M: ≈ 4M/3 → ∞. ✓ (inequality satisfied with increasing slack)

**V3.1 VERIFIED:** All Example 4.3 computations correct. ✓

## 4. Remark 7.5a: Action-Angle Van Vleck = 1 (THREE-AGENT prior result)

For H=H(I) integrable: S_cl = -H(I)t + I·(θ-θ')
∂²S_cl/∂I_j∂θ'_k = -δ_{jk} → Van Vleck = det(-∂²S/∂I∂θ') = det(I_n) = 1. ✓

t^{-n/2} from energy Hessian Ω_{jk} = ∂²H/∂I_j∂I_k, confirmed 2026-02-21. ✓

## 5. Scope Assessment

**V5.1:** Paper explicitly labeled "dependent note" with bounded scope (φ,L_z witness
only). No claims to new research results beyond Example 4.3 and Proposition 4.2.
The 40 references support the pedagogical/context apparatus. ✓

**V5.2 FLAG (sev-3):** Remark structure is very heavy relative to core content (§§2-4
≈ 40 lines; remarks ≈ 170 lines). This is a legitimate satellite format (detailed
context for a single clean mathematical result), but it could be misread as inflation.
The paper's self-description as "dependent note" mitigates this concern.

**V5.3:** All cited results verified for correctness where checkable:
- Judge 1964: first circular uncertainty relation (correctly cited)
- Carruthers-Nieto 1968: systematic treatment (correctly cited)
- Susskind-Glogower 1964: Ê_-|n⟩ = |n-1⟩ with [N,Ê_-] = -Ê_- (correctly cited)
- Pegg-Barnett 1989: truncated Hermitian phase operator (correctly cited)

## 6. Overall Verdict

| Section | Status | Severity |
|---------|--------|----------|
| §2 [L_z, E] = ℏE | VERIFIED ✓ | — |
| Proposition 4.2 (circular uncertainty) | VERIFIED ✓ (derivation checked step-by-step) | — |
| Example 4.3 R = 2M/(2M+1) | VERIFIED ✓ | — |
| Example 4.3 Var(L_z) = ℏ²M(M+1)/3 | VERIFIED ✓ | — |
| Example 4.3 ratio (M+1)(4M+1)/(3M) | VERIFIED ✓ | — |
| Remark 7.5a (action-angle Van Vleck = 1) | VERIFIED ✓ (standard + prior multi-agent) | — |
| Remark structure vs. core content | APPROPRIATE for "dependent note" format | sev-3 |

**PRE-VOTE: YES (NO REVISION NEEDED)**

No sev-1, sev-2, or sev-3 content errors. The structural sev-3 (remark-heavy) is
editorial and consistent with the paper's stated purpose. All mathematical claims
verified from first principles.

**Single-agent (mathematician). Two-agent rule: needs physicist or critic for scope
confirmation (is a "dependent note" format acceptable to referee? or should it be
integrated into cornerstone §X?).**

## 7. Critic Second-Agent Review (2026-02-21)

**C7.1 (Mathematics: CONCUR with all verifications).**
V1.1 ([L_z,E]=hbar E), V2.1 (Prop 4.2), V3.1 (Example 4.3) — all independently confirmed. The step-by-step Dirichlet kernel computation is particularly thorough.

**C7.2 (Prior-art attribution: RESOLVED).**
My earlier sev-2 concern (Judge 1964 and Carruthers-Nieto 1968 not cited) has been RESOLVED. Line 92 of the current paper explicitly attributes the circular uncertainty framework to Judge/Carruthers-Nieto and clarifies the paper's contribution (verification + near-saturation analysis). Judge 1964 now has a full bibliographic entry (line 254). This was the single blocking issue for READY status.

**C7.3 (Scope confirmation: "dependent note" format ACCEPTABLE).**
The mathematician asks whether this should be standalone or integrated into the cornerstone. Assessment: standalone is CORRECT for this paper. Reasons:
- The paper has 40 references of its own (more than most satellites), indicating genuine scholarship
- The circular statistics framework (Judge/Carruthers-Nieto) is a self-contained topic that would bloat the cornerstone if integrated
- The "dependent note" label is honest — it explicitly says the paper depends on the cornerstone's framework
- Referee reception: standalone dependent notes are standard in physics (cf. "companion paper" or "supplementary note" format)

**C7.4 (V5.2 remark-heavy structure: CONCUR, sev-3).**
The 170 lines of remarks vs 40 lines of core IS heavy, but this is appropriate for a dependent note whose purpose is to provide context and connections, not to prove new theorems. The paper's self-awareness mitigates this.

**C7.5 (Pre-vote: CONCUR with YES, NO REVISION NEEDED).**
With the prior-art fix applied, the paper has zero sev-1/sev-2 issues. The sev-3 structural note is editorial only. Paper READY for referee submission.

**C7.6 (Pipeline upgrade: action-angle CLOSE → READY).**
Prior-art gap resolved. Publication pipeline now: 12 READY, 0 CLOSE, 2 GENRE MISMATCH.

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT** (mathematician + critic). Pre-vote: YES (NO REVISION NEEDED).
