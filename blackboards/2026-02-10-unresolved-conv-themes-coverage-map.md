# Unresolved `conv_patched.md` Themes: Coverage Map

Date: 2026-02-10  
Cycle: `S41`

## Goal
Identify high-value themes from `conv_patched.md` that are still underrepresented in current manuscript drafts.

## Coverage Matrix
| Theme from `conv_patched.md` | Current coverage | Gap status | Proposed next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Control map \(\tau\), refinement invariance, RG as compatibility | Strong in `paper/main.md` Sec. 8 and `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` | Covered | Keep quality passes only |
| Planck areal speed \(\to\) Compton-scale branch (inverse-square) | Strong in `papers/planck-area/main.md` D1.5 chain | Covered | Continue precision polishing |
| "Newton limit is not automatically rigorous" (Zeno-style refinement paradox) and why a finite deformation scale is natural | Explicit in `paper/main.md` Introduction (`Heuristic H0.2`, `Heuristic H0.2a`) with concrete witnesses (measure, ordering, subtraction) | Covered | Keep quality passes only |
| GR extension (timelike circular stability / ISCO integration into branch logic) | Baseline exists in `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` (photon sphere + ISCO) | Covered | Continue polishing/citations if publishing this dependent note |
| Gauge-phase asymptotics (Coulomb/confining/screened) and string tension role | Only brief mentions in `papers/planck-area/main.md` hypotheses | Partial/Missing | `S` for clean bridge note; then `C` in RG or planck-area |
| QFT doubling (\(|\mathcal A|^2\) and closed-time-path structure) as half-density continuation | Explicit remark-level bridge in `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` (doubling / density-matrix kernel evolution) | Covered | Keep quality passes only |
| Functional-delta \(\delta(\delta S/\delta\phi)\) rigor boundary (what survives regularization) | Mentioned as outlook in `papers/delta-objects/main.md` | Partial | `B` + `S` before stronger promotion |
| Clarification of "uncuttable" as infinite refinement complexity, not indivisibility | Codified as controlled refinement in `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md` | Covered | Keep historically neutral unless we open a dedicated `B` cycle |

## Prioritization
Highest immediate manuscript ROI: **generic-\(q\) areal-speed derivation and/or control-map \(\tau\) formalization**.

Reason:
1. It turns high-level conversation claims into derivation-first statements we can own without transcript dependence.
2. It is low bibliography debt: the generic-\(q\) computation is self-contained, and \(\tau\) formalization can start as an internal note.
3. It strengthens the central "controlled refinement" thesis by clarifying what is input (control data) vs output (invariants/limits).
