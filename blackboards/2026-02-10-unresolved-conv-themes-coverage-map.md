# Unresolved `conv_patched.md` Themes: Coverage Map

Date: 2026-02-10  
Cycle: `S41`

## Goal
Identify high-value themes from `conv_patched.md` that are still underrepresented in current manuscript drafts.

## Coverage Matrix
| Theme from `conv_patched.md` | Current coverage | Gap status | Proposed next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Control map \(\tau\), refinement invariance, RG as compatibility | Strong in `paper/main.md` Sec. 8 and `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` | Covered | Keep quality passes only |
| Planck areal speed \(\to\) Compton-scale branch (inverse-square) | Strong in `papers/planck-area/main.md` D1.5 chain | Covered | Continue precision polishing |
| "Newton limit is not automatically rigorous" (Zeno-style refinement paradox) and why a finite deformation scale is natural | Partially implicit in `paper/main.md` (refinement limits + control) | Partial | Promote one short motivating remark in the main paper clarifying the obstruction is *limit control* and is resolved by keeping a finite action-scale parameter |
| GR extension (timelike circular stability / ISCO integration into branch logic) | Baseline exists in `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` with explicit open item | Partial | `S` then `C` to add timelike ISCO derivation block |
| Gauge-phase asymptotics (Coulomb/confining/screened) and string tension role | Only brief mentions in `papers/planck-area/main.md` hypotheses | Partial/Missing | `S` for clean bridge note; then `C` in RG or planck-area |
| QFT doubling (\(|\mathcal A|^2\) and closed-time-path structure) as half-density continuation | Not explicit in `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` | Missing | Promote concise remark in `C68` |
| Functional-delta \(\delta(\delta S/\delta\phi)\) rigor boundary (what survives regularization) | Mentioned as outlook in `papers/delta-objects/main.md` | Partial | `B` + `S` before stronger promotion |
| Clarification of "uncuttable" as infinite refinement complexity, not indivisibility | Not explicitly codified | Missing | Add one definition-level note in a future quality/content cycle |

## Prioritization
Highest immediate manuscript ROI: **QFT doubling as half-density continuation**.

Reason:
1. It directly addresses the user-priority "half-density in QFT, not only QM/statics".
2. It strengthens cross-paper coherence (`paper/main.md` amplitude-density logic \(\leftrightarrow\) `papers/half-density-qft/main.md`).
3. It can be promoted with low scope risk (one compact remark, no heavy new machinery).
