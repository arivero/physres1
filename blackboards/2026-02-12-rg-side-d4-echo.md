# Does D=4 Have an RG-Side Echo of the Conformal Half-Density Cancellation?

Source anomaly: DX01 dimension-selection asymmetry

## Question

The half-density conformal conjugation filter selects D=4 by a clean algebraic
mechanism: the coefficient D(4-D)/4 in the half-density Laplacian vanishes
uniquely at D=4 (H4.0b in paper/main.md; D1.3 in papers/half-density-qft/main.md).

The RG / renormalization side of the manuscript (Section 8) does not select any
dimension intrinsically. Is there a structural RG-side statement that echoes
the D=4 result?

## Three Candidate RG-Side Echoes

### 1. YM power-counting marginality
[g_D^2] = length^{D-4} vanishes at D=4. Universal half-density filter vs
coupling-specific RG filter -- both linear in (D-4).

### 2. Conformal invariance of classical YM
YM action weight e^{(D-4)s} = 1 at D=4. Logically independent from
half-density but structurally parallel.

### 3. Trace anomaly / beta function link
Gauge coupling marginal at D=4 so beta is dimensionless and appears in
the trace anomaly. Deepest echo: RG and conformal structure linked cleanest
at D=4.

## Synthesis

Half-density filter: universal, kinematic (geometry only).
RG filter: coupling-specific, dynamic (depends on field content).

Triple coincidence at D=4:
(a) D(4-D)/4 vanishes (operator simplicity)
(b) gauge coupling marginal (logarithmic running)
(c) G_4 = area = length^{d/2} (Planck-area sieve)

## Resolution of DX01 Anomaly

The asymmetry is real but interpretable: half-density selects the arena
(which D), RG operates within it (how couplings run).

Form-degree matching: p-form gauge action conformally marginal at D=2(p+1).
For p=1: D=4. For p=2: D=6 (no match). For phi^4 scalars: also D=4 (match).

## Promotion Candidate

Compact remark for future C cycle: the two D=4 filters are logically
independent -- kinematic arena selection vs dynamic coupling constraint.

## Open Questions
1. Is p=1 to D=4 matching deeper than 2(p+1)=4?
2. Can the trace-anomaly link be stated as half-density/RG compatibility?
3. Role of phi^4 marginality at D=4?
