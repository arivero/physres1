# Moyal Product Beyond Quadratic: Cubic Witness

Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S107

## Goal
Compute the Moyal bracket [q³, p³]_⋆ to show the first genuine O(ℏ³) quantum correction that goes beyond iℏ{q³,p³}.

## Setup
The Moyal product for pure monomials f = q^m, g = p^n simplifies because ∂_p f = 0 and ∂_q g = 0. The only surviving terms in the bidifferential expansion are:

q^m ⋆ p^n = Σ_{k=0}^{min(m,n)} (iℏ/2)^k / k! · (∂^k_q q^m)(∂^k_p p^n)
           = Σ_{k=0}^{min(m,n)} (iℏ/2)^k / k! · [m!/(m-k)!] · [n!/(n-k)!] · q^{m-k} p^{n-k}

Similarly:
p^n ⋆ q^m = Σ_{k=0}^{min(m,n)} (-iℏ/2)^k / k! · [n!/(n-k)!] · [m!/(m-k)!] · p^{n-k} q^{m-k}
           = Σ_{k=0}^{min(m,n)} (-iℏ/2)^k / k! · [m!/(m-k)!] · [n!/(n-k)!] · q^{m-k} p^{n-k}

(The last equality uses commutativity of classical functions: these are phase-space functions, not operators.)

## Commutator
[q^m, p^n]_⋆ = q^m ⋆ p^n - p^n ⋆ q^m
= Σ_{k=0}^{min(m,n)} [(iℏ/2)^k - (-iℏ/2)^k] / k! · [m!/(m-k)!][n!/(n-k)!] q^{m-k}p^{n-k}

Only odd k survive (since (iℏ/2)^k - (-iℏ/2)^k = 0 for even k, = 2(iℏ/2)^k for odd k):

[q^m, p^n]_⋆ = Σ_{k odd} 2(iℏ/2)^k / k! · [m!/(m-k)!][n!/(n-k)!] q^{m-k}p^{n-k}

## Case m = n = 1 (linear): only k=1
[q, p]_⋆ = 2(iℏ/2)/1! · 1·1 = iℏ
This is exact: no higher corrections. ✓ (Matches D5.1a.)

## Case m = n = 2 (quadratic): k=1 only (k=2 is even, skipped; k=3 > min(2,2))
Wait, k=1 is the only odd term ≤ min(2,2)=2.
[q², p²]_⋆ = 2(iℏ/2)/1! · 2·2 · qp = 4iℏqp
And iℏ{q², p²} = iℏ · 2q·2p = 4iℏqp. ✓
No O(ℏ³) correction. The Moyal bracket equals iℏ times the Poisson bracket exactly for quadratic polynomials.

## Case m = n = 3 (cubic): k=1 and k=3 both contribute
k=1: 2(iℏ/2)/1! · 3!/(2!)·3!/(2!) · q²p² = iℏ · 9q²p²
k=3: 2(iℏ/2)³/3! · 3!/(0!)·3!/(0!) · q⁰p⁰ = 2(-iℏ³/8)/6 · 36 = -3iℏ³/2

So:
[q³, p³]_⋆ = 9iℏq²p² - (3/2)iℏ³

And iℏ{q³, p³} = 9iℏq²p².

Therefore:
[q³, p³]_⋆ = iℏ{q³, p³} - (3/2)iℏ³

The correction -(3/2)iℏ³ is the first genuine quantum correction beyond the Poisson bracket. It is a constant (q,p-independent).

## Structural observations

1. **Why quadratics are "safe"**: For polynomials of degree ≤ 2, all derivatives of order ≥ 3 vanish, so only k=1 contributes to the Moyal bracket. The result is exactly iℏ{f,g}. This is why the Heisenberg algebra generated by q, p (with [q,p]=iℏ) captures the full Moyal structure for linear and quadratic observables.

2. **Why cubics break this**: At degree 3, the k=3 term is nonzero and contributes a constant O(ℏ³) correction. This is a genuine quantum effect with no classical analog — it cannot be recovered from the Poisson bracket alone.

3. **General pattern**: For q^n ⋆ p^n, corrections appear at orders ℏ³, ℏ⁵, ..., up to ℏ^n (for n odd) or ℏ^{n-1} (for n even). The leading correction is always at O(ℏ³).

4. **Connection to ordering**: In the operator language, [q̂³, p̂³] in Weyl ordering differs from the naive "iℏ times the Poisson bracket" by terms arising from iterated commutators. The Moyal product captures all of these systematically.

## Candidate text for promotion

After D5.1a in Section 7.3:

```
`Derivation D5.1b (Cubic witness: O(ℏ³) correction in the Moyal bracket).`
For the pure-monomial pair \(f=q^m\), \(g=p^n\), the bidifferential expansion of \(f\star_M g\) terminates after \(\min(m,n)\) terms, so the Moyal bracket is the finite sum
\[[q^m,p^n]_{\star_M}=\sum_{k\;\mathrm{odd}}^{\min(m,n)}\frac{2(i\hbar/2)^k}{k!}\,\frac{m!\,n!}{(m-k)!\,(n-k)!}\,q^{m-k}p^{n-k}.\]
For \(m,n\le 2\) only \(k=1\) survives, recovering \([q^m,p^n]_{\star_M}=i\hbar\{q^m,p^n\}\) exactly — the Poisson bracket suffices. At \(m=n=3\) the \(k=3\) term is no longer zero:
\[[q^3,p^3]_{\star_M}=9i\hbar\,q^2p^2-\tfrac32\,i\hbar^3=i\hbar\{q^3,p^3\}-\tfrac32\,i\hbar^3.\]
The constant \(-\tfrac32 i\hbar^3\) is the first genuine quantum correction beyond the Poisson bracket; it cannot be obtained from \(\{q^3,p^3\}\) alone. The cubic case is therefore the minimal witness that deformation quantization genuinely deforms the Poisson algebra, not merely re-encodes it.
