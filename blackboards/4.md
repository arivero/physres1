# RG-Fundamental Revision Support

## 1. 3D Loop Integral: Referee-2 M3 Rebuttal

**Ref-2 M3 claim:** Im(I_{3D}) should be $-i(m/4\pi\hbar^2)k$, not $-i(m/2\pi\hbar^2)k$.

**Paper's formula (Section 5.8.1 and 5.9):**
$$I_3(E;\Lambda) = -\frac{m}{\pi^2\hbar^2}\Lambda - i\frac{m}{2\pi\hbar^2}k + O(k^2/\Lambda).$$

### Verification

Convention: $I_d(E;\Lambda) = \int_{|q|<\Lambda} \frac{d^dq}{(2\pi)^d} \frac{1}{E - \hbar^2q^2/(2m) + i0}$.

For d=3, $E = \hbar^2 k^2/(2m)$. Sokhotski-Plemelj:
$$\text{Im}(I_3) = -\pi \int_{|q|<\Lambda} \frac{d^3q}{(2\pi)^3} \delta\!\left(\frac{\hbar^2(k^2-q^2)}{2m}\right).$$

Delta function chain rule:
$$\delta\!\left(\frac{\hbar^2(k^2-q^2)}{2m}\right) = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \cdot \frac{1}{2k}\delta(|q|-k) = \frac{m}{\hbar^2 k}\delta(|q|-k).$$

Angular integration: $\int d^3q \to \int_0^\Lambda 4\pi q^2\, dq$.

$$\text{Im}(I_3) = -\pi \cdot \frac{4\pi}{(2\pi)^3} \cdot k^2 \cdot \frac{m}{\hbar^2 k} = -\pi \cdot \frac{1}{2\pi^2} \cdot \frac{mk}{\hbar^2} = -\frac{mk}{2\pi\hbar^2}.$$

**Result:** $\text{Im}(I_3) = -mk/(2\pi\hbar^2)$. **Paper is CORRECT.**

### Referee's error
Ref-2 writes: "$(1/2\pi)^2 \cdot (-i\pi) \cdot (m/\hbar^2) \cdot k = -i(mk)/(4\pi\hbar^2)$".

The factor $(1/2\pi)^2 = 1/(4\pi^2)$ is WRONG for d=3. The correct measure factor is:
$$\frac{4\pi}{(2\pi)^3} = \frac{4\pi}{8\pi^3} = \frac{1}{2\pi^2}.$$

Referee used $(2\pi)^{-2}$ (d=2 convention) instead of $4\pi \cdot (2\pi)^{-3}$ (d=3). This gives $1/(4\pi^2)$ instead of $1/(2\pi^2)$, hence the factor-of-2 discrepancy.

**Recommendation:** Contest M3 in response letter with this explicit calculation.

## 2. Pre-Vote Postmortem: What BB1 Missed

| Referee issue | Pre-vote | Why missed |
|---|---|---|
| M1 (Ref-1): RG-P1.1 generator unproven | "CORRECT framing" | Verified statement, not inference chain |
| M2 (Ref-1): Calculus analogy misleading | "CORRECT analogy" | Assessed math, not analogy honesty |
| M3 (Ref-1): Section 4 defers to companion | Not assessed | Focused on 2D delta; skipped §4 sufficiency |
| M2 (Ref-2): RG-R1.1 internal tags | N/A | Added post-pre-vote |
| M3 (Ref-2): 3D Im(I_3) factor-of-2 | Not checked | Pre-vote verified 2D only; paper correct |

### Pre-vote calibration lessons
1. Check INFERENCE CHAINS, not just individual statements
2. Assess STANDALONE SUFFICIENCY of each section
3. Verify ALL numerical formulas, not just the primary one
4. Assess ANALOGY HONESTY: when a paper uses analogy as argument, check disanalogy acknowledgment

## 2026-02-21 institute run - critic
Claim stress-tested (`meta/research-state.md`): "All 13 satellite reviews completed: zero sev-1 errors across 93 algebra checks (Critic)."
- sev-1: No direct contradiction found; however, this can be read as "zero sev-1 defects overall," which is stronger than the measured scope.
- sev-2: Scope inflation risk: denominator is algebra checks, but headline noun is full "satellite reviews" (includes non-algebraic logic/exposition).
- sev-2: Coverage opacity: 93 checks are not partitioned by paper/section, so blind spots in inference-chain review are hard to quantify.
- sev-3: Temporal fragility: result is session-bound (2026-02-20) and should be date-scoped when reused.
Wording fix proposal (concrete):
"Across 93 algebra checks in 13 satellite reviews (as of 2026-02-20), no sev-1 algebra defects were found; non-algebraic sev-1 risk remains under review."
Audit suggestion: pair every "zero sev-1" headline with two metrics: algebra coverage and inference/standalone coverage.

## 2026-02-21 R15B-007
Run focus: compact guardrail for "zero sev-1" headlines.
Template fields:
- Algebra coverage = checked equations / target equations.
- Inference coverage = checked claim chains / target chains.
- Standalone coverage = sections with full local derivation context.
Release rule: publish "zero sev-1" only with all 3 coverages reported.
Qualifier rule: if any coverage <100%, use "none found in checked subset (date-scoped)".
Verdict: READY as a reusable checklist snippet for next critic pass.

## 2026-02-21 R15B-011
Claim gate (critic): prevent sev-label drift in status summaries.
- sev-1: blocked if headline implies full-scope proof without scope columns.
- sev-2: flag if numerator/denominator types differ (e.g., reviews vs algebra checks).
- sev-3: flag if statement is not date-scoped.
Required suffix for partial audits:
"in checked subset" + explicit check-type + date.
Pass example: "No sev-1 algebra defects found in checked subset (93 checks, 2026-02-20)."

## 2026-02-21 R15B-020
Severity calibration micro-note (critic).
- sev-1 trigger: claim wording can cause false acceptance of unverified scope.
- sev-2 trigger: missing coverage dimensions (algebra/inference/standalone).
- sev-3 trigger: stale statement reused without date.
Minimal safe phrasing pattern:
"No sev-1 defects found in [check-type] subset ([count] checks, [YYYY-MM-DD])."
Action: require this pattern in future status bullets mentioning "zero sev-1".

## 2026-02-21 R15B-024
Claim hardening snippet (critic, reusable).
- Target phrase to avoid: "zero sev-1 errors" (scope-ambiguous).
- Replace with: "no sev-1 defects found in audited subset".
- Always attach tuple: (type, count, date).
Example:
"No sev-1 defects found in algebra subset (93 checks, 2026-02-20)."
If inference coverage is partial, append:
"Inference-chain coverage incomplete; sev-1 risk outside audited subset remains."

## 2026-02-21 R15B-030
Stop/Go recommendation for xref fix application:
- Current file state at `paper/main.md:660` and `paper/main.md:672` already uses label-only refs
  (`Remark P4.2c`, `Proposition P4.2(ii)`) with no "below/above" wording.
- Decision: **STOP** applying the old diff (would be redundant/no-op and may create patch drift).
- Operational go-path: mark task as already satisfied; only re-open if new directional xref wording reappears.

## 2026-02-21 R15B-031
Final critic guardrail (compact).
- Never publish bare phrase: "zero sev-1 errors".
- Required form: scope + metric + date.
- Minimal compliant example:
"No sev-1 defects found in audited algebra subset (93 checks, 2026-02-20)."
- If any scope missing, severity defaults to sev-2 wording risk.
