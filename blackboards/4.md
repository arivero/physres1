# OQ3 Level 2: Half-Density Curvature Corrections to Contact Operators (d=4)

## 1. Setup: contact expansion + half-density curvature term

**Standard contact expansion (d=3 spatial, Derivation 4.1 of fermionic-mediators paper):**
$$\mathcal{A}(q) = C_0 + C_2 q^2 + C_4 q^4 + \cdots$$

**Half-density kinetic operator on curved background (ordering-equivalence OE-P1.3, Layer 3):**
$$H_{\rm HD} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + V(q) + \frac{\hbar^2}{6m} R(q) + O(\hbar^4)$$

Curvature potential: $V_{\rm curv}(q) = \frac{\hbar^2}{6m} R(q)$

This is the unique coefficient for the half-density prescription; other prescriptions yield $\xi R/m$ with $\xi \neq 1/6$.

## 2. How half-density measure modifies contact coefficients

### 2.1 The delta kernel as bi-half-density (HD-D1.1)

The contact kernel in coordinate space (Born level, s-wave) is:
$$K_{\rm contact}(x,y) = C_0 \delta^{(d)}(x-y) |dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}$$

Under curved-space scalarization $\psi = |g|^{1/4}\phi$, the identity kernel is:
$$K_{\rm Id}(x,y) = \delta^{(d)}(x-y)|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2} = |g(x)|^{-1/4}\delta^{(d)}_g(x-y)|g(y)|^{-1/4}|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}$$

where $\delta^{(d)}_g$ is the metric delta: $\int \delta^{(d)}_g(x-y) f(y) \sqrt{|g|}d^dy = f(x)$.

**Key point:** $\delta^{(d)}(x-y) = |g(x)|^{-1/2} \delta^{(d)}_g(x-y)$, so:
$$C_0 \delta^{(d)}(x-y) = C_0 |g(x)|^{-1/2} \delta^{(d)}_g(x-y)$$

In the half-density representation, the leading contact coefficient $C_0$ picks up a factor of $|g|^{-1/2}$ relative to the flat-space definition. In normal coordinates near $x=y$, $|g|^{1/2} = 1 - \frac{1}{6}R_{\mu\nu}x^\mu x^\nu + O(x^3)$, so at coincidence this is 1 — no direct modification of $C_0$.

**But the derivative contact term $C_2 \nabla^2\delta$ is modified:**

In curved space, $\nabla^2_g \delta^{(d)}_g(x-y)$ differs from the flat $\partial^2\delta^{(d)}(x-y)$ by connection terms. In normal coordinates:
$$\nabla^2_g = \partial^2 - \frac{1}{3}R_{\mu\nu}x^\mu\partial^\nu + O(x^2)$$

So the first curvature correction to the $C_2$-term contact kernel is:
$$C_2(-\nabla^2_g)\delta^{(d)}_g(x-y) \supset C_2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}R_{\mu\nu}\partial^\nu\delta^{(d)}(x-y)$$

This is a **new local derivative-contact operator** generated by the curved background. In momentum space:
$$\hat K_{\rm curv-contact}(q) \sim \frac{C_2}{3}R_{\mu\nu}q^\mu q^\nu$$

In $d=4$ with isotropic background $R_{\mu\nu} = \frac{R}{4}g_{\mu\nu}$:
$$\hat K_{\rm curv-contact}(q) \sim \frac{C_2 R}{12} q^2$$

**Effect:** the curvature shifts the effective $C_2$ coefficient:
$$C_2^{\rm eff}(d=4) = C_2 + \frac{C_2 R L^2}{12} + \cdots$$

where $L^2$ is the relevant length scale (e.g., the range of the interaction $r_0^2$, or $\hbar^2/(mE)$ for kinematic scale).

## 3. Half-density potential: does V_curv = (ℏ²/6m)R generate new constraints?

### 3.1 Shift of effective contact coefficients

The curvature potential $V_{\rm curv} = \frac{\hbar^2}{6m}R$ acts as an additional momentum-independent background potential. In the Born approximation, it contributes to the scattering amplitude:
$$\delta\mathcal{A}_{\rm curv}(q) = \frac{\hbar^2}{6m}\int d^d x\, e^{iq\cdot x} R(x) \psi_0(x)^2$$

At zero momentum transfer and for slowly varying $R$:
$$\delta\mathcal{A}_{\rm curv}(0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{6m} R \cdot |\psi_0(0)|^2 \cdot V_{\rm eff}$$

This contributes to $C_0$ at order $\hbar^2 R$:
$$\delta C_0^{(\rm HD)} = \frac{\hbar^2 R}{6m} \cdot (\text{wavefunction overlap factor})$$

### 3.2 Physical interpretation in d=4

In $d=4$ spacetime (spatial $d_s=3$), $R$ has dimension $[R]=L^{-2}$. The curvature correction is:
$$\frac{\delta C_0^{(\rm HD)}}{C_0} \sim \frac{\hbar^2 R}{6m E_{\rm kin}} = \frac{L_{\rm Compton}^2 R}{6}$$

where $L_{\rm Compton} = \hbar/\sqrt{2mE}$ is the de Broglie wavelength.

**New constraint from HD:** The half-density curvature term $\frac{\hbar^2}{6m}R$ distinguishes the HD prescription from Weyl/other orderings at Layer 3. This means:

1. **$C_0$ is unaffected** at leading curvature order (the $|g|^{-1/2}$ factor at coincidence = 1 in normal coords).

2. **$C_2$ acquires a curvature-induced shift** (Section 2 above): $\Delta C_2 \sim C_2 R r_0^2/12$ where $r_0$ is the range.

3. **A new $O(\hbar^2 R)$ contribution** to $C_0$ arises from the curvature potential acting on the wavefunction. This is **beyond standard EFT** because it is prescription-dependent: the $1/6$ coefficient changes with ordering choice.

**Verdict on new constraints:** The half-density curvature correction does NOT generate new EFT constraints on $C_0$ and $C_2$ beyond what standard EFT already predicts — because:
- At leading order in $R$, the curvature effects on $C_0$ and $C_2$ can be absorbed into renormalization of the contact couplings at a reference scale.
- The $\hbar^2 R/6m$ term is a local operator already in the standard EFT operator basis (it is just $\xi R$ with $\xi=1/6$).
- Different prescriptions give different $\xi$: Weyl gives $\xi=0$, half-density gives $\xi=1/6$, conformal gives $\xi=(D-2)/(4(D-1))$.
- At $D=4$: conformal coupling has $\xi_{\rm conf}=1/6$ — the same as the half-density coefficient!

**Special coincidence at D=4:** The half-density curvature term $\frac{\hbar^2}{6m}R$ is numerically identical to the conformally-coupled curvature potential $\xi_{\rm conf}R$ in $D=4$. This means:
- In $D=4$, the half-density prescription automatically "knows" about conformal coupling.
- The contact expansion built on the HD kernel in $D=4$ curved space has a curvature correction $+\frac{\hbar^2}{6m}R\cdot\delta^{(3)}(r)$ in the effective potential.
- In $D\neq 4$, the HD coefficient $1/6$ differs from $\xi_{\rm conf}$, so there is a residual curvature term $\frac{\hbar^2}{m}(\xi_{\rm conf}-\frac{1}{6})R\cdot\delta^{(3)}(r)$ relative to the conformal EFT.

## 4. Positivity bound from composition unitarity

### 4.1 Standard positivity (Källén-Lehmann)

The standard unitarity positivity bound on $C_0$: for bosonic exchange, $C_0>0$ for attractive interactions (same-sign sources) follows from the spectral weight $\rho(\mu^2)\geq 0$.

The contact expansion $\mathcal{A}(q)=C_0+C_2q^2+\cdots$ has:
- $C_0 = \mathcal{A}(0)$ — the zero-momentum amplitude
- No sign constraint on $C_0$ from contact data alone (it can be attractive or repulsive)

### 4.2 Composition unitarity and half-density kernels

The composition law for bi-half-density kernels requires:
$$K_{t_1+t_2}(x,z) = \int K_{t_1}(x,y) K_{t_2}(y,z) d\mu(y)$$

For the kernel to be positive-definite (as an operator), one needs the semigroup condition $K_t^\dagger = K_t$ and $\langle\psi|K_t|\psi\rangle \geq 0$. For imaginary time ($t\to -i\tau$), this is the Osterwalder-Schrader positivity condition.

**Contact kernel positivity:** The contact kernel $C_0\delta^{(d)}(x-y)$ corresponds to the operator $C_0\cdot\mathbf{1}$ in momentum space. The Fourier transform of $\mathcal{A}(q)$ is positive definite iff $\mathcal{A}(q)\geq 0$ for all $q$ (Bochner's theorem). This requires:
$$C_0 \geq 0, \quad C_0 + C_2 q^2 + \cdots \geq 0 \text{ for all } q$$

**Curvature contribution to positivity:** The half-density curvature term adds:
$$\delta\mathcal{A}^{(R)}(q) \sim \frac{\hbar^2 R}{6m}$$

For $R>0$ (positive curvature, e.g. sphere), this adds a positive constant to $\mathcal{A}(q)$, improving positivity. For $R<0$ (hyperbolic space), it reduces $\mathcal{A}(q)$ and can violate the naive $C_0\geq 0$ bound.

**New bound from HD in d=4:**
$$C_0^{\rm eff} = C_0 + \frac{\hbar^2 R}{6m E_0} \cdot (\text{normalization factor})$$

For the composition semigroup to remain positive (Osterwalder-Schrader), one needs $C_0^{\rm eff}\geq 0$, giving:
$$C_0 \geq -\frac{\hbar^2 R}{6m E_0}$$

For $R>0$ (positive curvature): no new constraint (RHS is negative, automatically satisfied if $C_0\geq 0$).
For $R<0$ (negative curvature): $C_0\geq \frac{\hbar^2|R|}{6mE_0}$ — a **new positive lower bound** on $C_0$.

**Assessment:** This is a genuine but mild new constraint. It is the same type of bound as in standard EFT (positivity from unitarity), but the HD prescription makes the curvature-dependent bound explicit at $O(\hbar^2 R)$.

## 5. Level 2 verdict

**Question (1): Does HD measure modify $C_{2n}$?**
- $C_0$: unaffected at leading curvature order in normal coordinates.
- $C_2$: shifted by $\Delta C_2 \sim C_2 R r_0^2/12$ from metric Laplacian correction.
- New $O(\hbar^2 R)$ contribution to effective $C_0$ from the curvature potential $V_{\rm curv}$.
- These are calculable, finite, prescription-dependent corrections.

**Question (2): New constraints beyond standard EFT?**
- The $\frac{\hbar^2}{6m}R$ term is already in the standard EFT operator basis as $\xi R$.
- In $D=4$: HD coincides with conformal coupling ($\xi=1/6=\xi_{\rm conf}$) — no residual.
- In $D\neq 4$: residual curvature term $(\xi_{\rm conf}-1/6)R$ appears — but this is an EFT input, not a new constraint.
- **Verdict: Level 2 generates no qualitatively new constraints** on $C_{2n}$ beyond what standard EFT with curvature-coupled operators already provides. The HD prescription selects a specific value of $\xi$, but this is a choice of scheme, not a physical constraint.

**Question (3): Positivity bound from composition unitarity?**
- For $R<0$: HD curvature term gives a lower bound $C_0\geq\frac{\hbar^2|R|}{6mE_0}$ — a geometric lower bound on the leading contact coefficient.
- This is speculative (Level 3 per motivations.md) and requires explicit Osterwalder-Schrader analysis.
- **Flag for Computationalist:** check whether the $R<0$ bound survives in the full Lippmann-Schwinger resummation (not just Born level).

## 6. Promotion path

**Stability assessment:** The D=4 coincidence $\xi_{\rm HD}=\xi_{\rm conf}=1/6$ is a clean structural observation worth recording. It connects the contact-expansion story to the half-density/planck-area story.

**Proposed notebook entry:** "In D=4, the half-density curvature correction to the contact expansion (C_0+C_2q²+...) involves $\xi=1/6$, which coincides with conformal coupling — so the conformally coupled HD kernel in D=4 has no residual curvature contribution to the leading contact coefficient beyond what EFT already predicts."

**Computationalist check needed:** Verify the $\Delta C_2 \sim C_2 R r_0^2/12$ coefficient from the normal-coordinate Laplacian expansion. This is a straightforward symbolic computation.

**Not promotion-ready:** The positivity bound requires further work. Keep as a Level 3 open thread.
