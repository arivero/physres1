# RCP + Contact Universality: New Constraints?
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S207 (Open question #3)

## The question
Fermionic paper Remark 4.6 establishes universality: different UV
completions (Yukawa, vector, t-channel) → same C₀ → same IR physics.
Does RCP add constraints beyond standard EFT?

## What standard EFT already says
1. **Power counting** (Weinberg): operators organized by dimension.
   Contact tower C₀ + C₂q² + ... is the IR expansion.
2. **Decoupling** (Appelquist–Carazzone): heavy particles → power
   corrections C₂n ~ g²/M^{2n}.
3. **Positivity bounds** (Adams et al. 2006, recent S-matrix bootstrap):
   analyticity + crossing + unitarity constrain signs of C₂n.
4. **Running** (Callan–Symanzik): C₀ flows under RG; fixed points
   generate universality (Remark 5.3, Bertsch parameter ξ ≈ 0.37).

## What RCP adds: three levels

### Level 1 — Conceptual reframing (genuine but not new predictions)
RCP unifies three apparently separate structures as instances of
*composition-law consistency under refinement*:

| Structure | Composition form | Refinement parameter |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Path integral | K = ∫K₁K₂ (§6.1) | Δt → 0 |
| RG semigroup | R_{Λ→μ} = R_{κ→μ} ∘ R_{Λ→κ} (§8.2) | Λ → ∞ |
| Contact data | C₀(μ) defined by matching at scale μ (§5) | Λ cutoff removed |

Standard EFT treats these as separate mathematical facts:
- Path-integral composition is a postulate.
- RG invariance is derived from cutoff independence.
- Contact universality follows from decoupling.

RCP says they are all *the same thing*: consistency of the prediction
under change of refinement resolution. This is a genuine conceptual
unification, but it doesn't produce new numerical predictions.

### Level 2 — Half-density normalization as constraint source
The composition law forces t^{-d/2} normalization (D4.1a). In the
contact expansion, this means:

1. The short-time propagator with contact interaction must compose:
   K_Δ(q_f,q;t₁) · K_Δ(q,q_i;t₂) integrated over q must give
   K_{Δ}(q_f,q_i;t₁+t₂), where K includes the contact correction.

2. The Born series (T-matrix resummation in Examples 5.1–5.2) is
   exactly what enforces this: the renormalized scattering amplitude
   f₀(k) = -a/(1+ika) is the unique form compatible with unitarity
   of the composition law.

3. In d=4 (curved space), the half-density conjugation potential
   V = (1/6)R modifies the contact expansion: delta interactions
   acquire curvature corrections specific to the half-density
   normalization. Whether these corrections differ from standard
   minimal-coupling predictions is an open calculation.

**Assessment**: Level 2 *might* produce new constraints in curved
space at d=4, but the calculation hasn't been done. In flat space,
the composition-law constraint reproduces the unitarity bound (|f₀|≤1/k
for s-wave), which is already known.

### Level 3 — Positivity from composition (speculative)
Recent work on the S-matrix bootstrap derives positivity bounds on
Wilson coefficients from analyticity + crossing + unitarity. Could
RCP derive the same bounds from composition alone?

Idea: the composition law K = ∫K₁K₂, combined with the Born-rule
requirement |K|² = positive density, constrains the signs of C₂n
appearing in the contact expansion of K. This would be a different
derivation path: composition → positivity, rather than
analyticity + crossing → positivity.

**Assessment**: Speculative. Would need a concrete worked example
(e.g., show that C₂ > 0 follows from K₁*K₂ composition being
positive-definite). Not yet attempted.

## Honest verdict

| Level | Content | Novelty |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 (reframing) | Unifies PI composition, RG, contact under RCP | Conceptual, no new predictions |
| 2 (half-density) | t^{-d/2} normalization constrains contact expansion | Reproduces known unitarity bound in flat space; open in curved d=4 |
| 3 (positivity) | Composition → positivity bounds? | Speculative, unworked |

**Question 3 status**: Partially addressed. RCP provides a conceptual
unification of the universality story (Level 1). Whether it generates
*new* constraints beyond standard EFT depends on the curved-space
calculation (Level 2) and the positivity program (Level 3), both
of which remain open.

## Proposed update to motivations.md
Change question 3 status from "open" to:
"S207 analysis: RCP reframes contact universality as composition-law
consistency (conceptual gain). Two potential sources of new constraints
remain open: (a) half-density curvature corrections to contact operators
in d=4; (b) positivity bounds on C₂n from composition unitarity."

## Connection to other open questions
- Question 1 (d=4 selection): Level 2's curved-space calculation is a
  direct continuation — does V=(1/6)R at d=4 constrain the contact
  expansion in curved space?
- Question 4 (non-perturbative): Level 3's positivity program connects
  to resurgence — the non-perturbative content of the contact expansion
  might be constrained by composition unitarity beyond perturbation theory.
