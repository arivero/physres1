# Adiabatic Limit as Controlled Refinement
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S129

## Context
The uncuttable satellite shows refinement limits in analysis (Section 2) and dynamics
(Section 3). The adiabatic theorem is another instance: the adiabatic limit T→∞
(infinitely slow parameter change) is a refinement limit where the "mesh" is the
rate of change, and geometric phases (Berry phase) are the "corrections" that survive.

## Key claims

1. **Adiabatic theorem as refinement.** A time-dependent Hamiltonian H(t/T) with
   T → ∞ has an adiabatic limit: the instantaneous eigenstate |n(t/T)⟩ is the
   "approximant," and the exact evolution is the refinement limit. The adiabatic
   condition requires slow change compared to transition frequencies:
   |⟨m|dH/dt|n⟩| ≪ (E_n - E_m)²/ℏ for all m ≠ n, or equivalently the dimensionless
   parameter ε_mn = (ℏ/|E_n - E_m|²)|⟨m|Ḣ|n⟩| ≪ 1.

2. **Berry phase as geometric correction.** After a slow cyclic evolution, the state
   acquires a dynamical phase exp(-i∫E_n dt/ℏ) plus a geometric phase
   exp(iγ_n) where γ_n = i∮⟨n|∇_R n⟩·dR is the Berry phase (Berry 1984).
   The geometric phase is independent of the parametrization speed *in the adiabatic
   regime* — it depends only on the path geometry in parameter space, not the rate
   of traversal (provided adiabaticity is maintained throughout).

3. **Analogy to ordering corrections.** The Berry phase is a dimensionless geometric
   correction that vanishes for contractible paths but can be non-zero (and topologically
   quantized) for non-contractible loops in non-trivial bundles. Compare: the ordering
   correction αiℏ (Example 3.1) vanishes when ℏ→0 but is unavoidable at finite ℏ.
   Both are "extra structure" that naive limits miss — finite geometric data that
   persist through refinement but aren't captured by local approximants.

4. **Structural parallel.** The adiabatic limit shares the "uncuttable" pattern:
   - Approximant: instantaneous eigenstate (at each "time slice")
   - Refinement: T → ∞ (slower and slower parameter change)
   - Correction tower: non-adiabatic (diabatic) transitions exponentially suppressed
     as exp(-S/ℏ) where S is a WKB action integral (e.g., Landau-Zener formula);
     geometric phases persist exactly even at T = ∞
   - Control data: the gap condition (E_n - E_m bounded away from zero)

5. **Connection to holonomy.** The Berry phase is a holonomy of a connection on
   a fiber bundle (the eigenstate bundle over parameter space). This connects
   to the half-density/connection theme of the cornerstone: the "extra structure"
   needed for the refinement limit is geometric (a connection), not merely analytic.

## Proposed remark for uncuttable satellite
Remark 3.5 (~3 lines) after Remark 3.4. State the adiabatic theorem as a
refinement limit, note Berry phase as the geometric correction, connect to the
"extra structure" theme. Keep compact — no formulas, just the structural parallel.

**Claim 1 (Adiabatic condition):** **ERROR**
The adiabatic condition is incorrectly stated. The standard dimensionless adiabatic
parameter is ε = |⟨m|Ḣ|n⟩|/((E_n - E_m)²/ℏ) ≪ 1, where Ḣ = dH/dt. This can be
written as |⟨m|Ḣ|n⟩|/(E_n - E_m)² ≪ ω_mn/ℏ where ω_mn = (E_n - E_m)/ℏ is the
Bohr frequency. The denominator should scale as energy², and the condition compares
the transition rate to the gap. The factor of ℏ placement in the numerator as
written is dimensionally problematic.

**Corrected statement:** The adiabatic condition requires that the rate of change
of H be slow compared to the relevant transition frequencies: |⟨m|dH/dt|n⟩| ≪
(E_n - E_m)²/ℏ for all m ≠ n, or equivalently ε_mn = (ℏ/|E_n - E_m|²)|⟨m|Ḣ|n⟩| ≪ 1.

**Claim 2 (Berry phase formula):** **CORRECT WITH CAVEATS**
The formula γ_n = i∮⟨n|∇_R n⟩·dR is correct (sign convention with i is standard
in physics, though some texts omit it). The "speed independence" statement needs
qualification: the Berry phase is independent of parametrization speed *only when*
the adiabatic condition is satisfied everywhere along the path. If the evolution
is too fast at any point, diabatic transitions occur and the geometric phase
picture breaks down. The statement should clarify: "independent of speed in the
adiabatic regime."

**Claim 3 (Ordering correction analogy):** **CORRECT WITH CAVEATS**
The structural analogy is insightful, but "O(ℏ⁰)" is imprecise language. The Berry
phase γ is dimensionless and doesn't have a traditional ℏ expansion — it's a
geometric/topological object. The analogy works on the level of "extra structure
that naive limits miss," but shouldn't be pushed to dimensional/scaling arguments.
Better framing: both Berry phase and ordering corrections are finite geometric
data that persist through refinement limits where naive approximations would miss them.

**Claim 4 (Structural parallel):** **CORRECT WITH CAVEATS**
The structural analogy is sound. However, the scaling "exp(-T·gap²/ℏ)" is too
specific. Non-adiabatic transition probabilities generally scale as exp(-S/ℏ)
where S is a WKB action integral; the precise functional form depends on the path
in parameter space. For Landau-Zener (linear avoided crossing), P ∝ exp(-πΔ²/(2ℏv))
where Δ is the minimum gap and v the sweep rate. The key point stands: geometric
phases survive at T→∞ while diabatic leakage is exponentially suppressed.

**Claim 5 (Holonomy connection):** **CORRECT**
This is exactly right. The Berry connection A_n^μ = i⟨n(R)|∂_μ n(R)⟩ is a U(1)
connection on the line bundle of eigenstates over parameter space M. The Berry
phase is its holonomy ∮A·dR. The Berry curvature F = dA is gauge-invariant, and
its integral (Chern number) gives topological quantization for closed manifolds.
This is precisely the "extra geometric structure" (connection data) beyond the
base space — a perfect parallel to half-densities/connections in the cornerstone theme.

**Overall assessment:**
The core structural insight (adiabatic limit as refinement, Berry phase as geometric
correction, connection to holonomy) is solid and publishable. Fix the adiabatic
condition in Claim 1, add caveats about speed independence and exponential scaling,
and avoid over-interpreting the ℏ-scaling analogy. The proposed Remark 3.5 should
emphasize the *geometric* (connection/holonomy) nature of the "extra structure" —
this is the cleanest link to the cornerstone's half-density theme.
