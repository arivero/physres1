# Ordering-Equivalence: Mathematical Verification (Pre-Vote)

## 1. §3 PDM Computation Check

**LR ordering (§3.1):** f=1/m, p̂=-iℏ∂_q.

H_LR = ½[f p̂² + p̂² f] + V(q)

p̂²f·ψ = -ℏ²∂_q[f''ψ + 2f'ψ' + fψ'']  (product rule twice)

Wait: p̂²(fψ) = -ℏ²∂_q(fψ)' = -ℏ²[f''ψ + 2f'ψ' + fψ''] ✗ — need p̂²·(f·1):

p̂² f = -ℏ²(∂_q²·f) as OPERATOR = -ℏ²[f'' + 2f'∂_q + f∂_q²]

H_LR = ½·f(-ℏ²∂_q²) + ½(-ℏ²)[f'' + 2f'∂_q + f∂_q²] + V
     = -ℏ²/2·f∂_q² - ℏ²/2·f'∂_q - ℏ²/4·f'' + V  ✓

**HD ordering (§3.2):** Stated result:
H_HD = -ℏ²/2·f∂_q² - ℏ²/2·f'∂_q - ℏ²/8·f'' - ℏ²/32·(f')²/f + V

**V3.1 VERIFIED:** Layer 3 difference:
V_HD - V_LR = (-ℏ²/8·f'' - ℏ²/32·(f')²/f) - (-ℏ²/4·f'')
            = ℏ²/8·f'' - ℏ²/32·(f')²/f  ✓ (matches §3.3)

**V3.2 FLAG (sev-3):** §3.2 derivation of H_HD is compressed — intermediate steps not shown. The result is standard (e.g., de Gosson 2006, §7) but the paper should state "in oscillator units" for the energy gap formula.

## 2. §3.4 Energy Gap Verification

f(q) = 1 + αq² with α dimensionless (q in oscillator units a₀ = √(ℏ/mω)).

In these units: ℏω = 1, mω = 1, a₀ = 1.

δV = ℏ²/8·f'' - ℏ²/32·(f')²/f
   = (1/8)·2α - (1/32)·4α²q²/(1+αq²)
   ≈ α/4 - α²q²/8  [in units where ℏω=1]

Gap correction (first-order perturbation):
δ(E_n-E_0) = -α²/8·[⟨n|q²|n⟩ - ⟨0|q²|0⟩] = -α²/8·⟨0→n|q²|n-0⟩

In oscillator units: ⟨n|q²|n⟩ = n + ½, so:
δ(E_n-E_0) = -α²n/8  [in units where ℏω=1]

Paper states -ℏωα²n/8. In our units ℏω=1, so: -α²n/8 = -ℏωα²n/8. ✓

**V3.3 VERIFIED:** Formula correct in oscillator units ℏω=1. Units not stated in paper — sev-3 imprecision only.

**V3.4 Numerical check:** |δ(E_1-E_0)| ~ ℏω·α²/8 = 10meV·(0.01)²/8 = 0.000125 meV ≈ 1.2×10⁻⁴ meV ✓
For α=0.001: 10meV·(0.001)²/8 = 1.25×10⁻⁶ meV ✓  (matches paper)

## 3. §4.3 Curvature Potential

V_curv = ℏ²R/(6m).

**V4.1 VERIFIED:** Standard Seeley-DeWitt coefficient. For scalar Laplacian −∇²/2m,
the heat-kernel expansion gives coefficient a₁(x) = R/6 at coincidence (DeWitt 1957).
This equals ξ_conf·R = R/6 in D=4 (independently verified by computationalist, BB0).

**V4.2.** OE-H1.2 states coefficients are "prescription-dependent." Correct: Weyl quantization
with no geometric terms gives 0; half-density gives R/6; "BenDaniel-Duke" gives R/8.
The R/6 is NOT universal for all orderings — only for half-density/geometric prescriptions.
Paper's language "all geometric prescriptions" is accurate when "geometric" is properly scoped. ✓

## 4. §5 Star-Product Claims

**V5.1.** OE-P1.4 (star products related by automorphism): Standard result in deformation
quantization (Kontsevich 2003, Theorem 1; Deligne 1995). VERIFIED.

**V5.2 FLAG (sev-3):** §5.2 terminology: "Vey product" and "Wick product" named for the
same object (standard-ordered product). These are in fact DIFFERENT:
- Vey product: formal deformation on symplectic manifolds (Vey 1975), locally equivalent to Moyal
- Wick (normal) ordering: specific to harmonic oscillator coherent states a, a†
- Standard-ordered product: (in 1D) {a^n(a†)^m} → standard form

The algebraic content of §5.2 (two star products related by O(ℏ²) automorphism) is CORRECT.
The naming is imprecise. Recommend: "a star product equivalent to Moyal at O(ℏ)" rather than
naming specific products without defining them.

## 5. OE-P1.5 (Midpoint ↔ Stratonovich ↔ Half-Density)

**V5.3 VERIFIED:** Standard result (Graham 1977, Langouche-Roekaerts-Tirapegui 1982,
Kleinert 2009 §5.4). Midpoint rule ↔ Stratonovich SDE ↔ half-density/LB operator. ✓

**V5.4 PRECISE SCOPE:** This equivalence is exact in 1D. In d>1, midpoint ↔ Stratonovich
still holds, but the resulting operator is ∂_i(g^{ij}∂_j) (LB) — which is the half-density
prescription only IF the wavefunction densitization uses |g|^{1/4}. This is standard but
the paper does not spell out the d>1 case explicitly. Sev-3.

## 6. OE-P1.6 Scope Assessment

Claim: Layer 3 differences "parametrically small (∝ ℏ²) and numerically unmeasurable."

**V6.1 CORRECT for stated regime** (bound states, moderate energies, atomic/solid-state). ✓

**V6.2 EXCEPTIONS not mentioned:**
- High-n Rydberg atoms: ⟨n|q²|n⟩ ~ n² in atomic units → ordering corrections scale as n²α²ℏω/8.
  For n~50 (typical Rydberg), this is 2500× the n=1 estimate — potentially measurable.
- Near conformal singularity: R(q) diverges → V_curv = ℏ²R/(6m) → O(1) corrections.
- Layer 4 (domain): The paper correctly excludes this. ✓

**Recommendation:** Add "for non-Rydberg atomic and solid-state systems with slowly varying mass"
to scope of OE-P1.6. Sev-3 omission.

## 7. Overall Verdict

| Section | Status | Severity |
|---------|--------|----------|
| §3.1 LR ordering | VERIFIED ✓ | — |
| §3.2 HD ordering result | CORRECT (standard); derivation compressed | sev-3 |
| §3.3 Layer 3 difference | VERIFIED ✓ | — |
| §3.4 energy gap formula | CORRECT in oscillator units; units unstated | sev-3 |
| §3.4 numerical estimate | VERIFIED ✓ | — |
| §4.3 curvature potential | VERIFIED ✓ (standard) | — |
| §5.2 star-product naming | Vey ≠ Wick; both ≠ standard-ordered | sev-3 |
| §5.3 OE-P1.5 | VERIFIED ✓ (standard); d>1 not spelled out | sev-3 |
| §6 OE-P1.6 scope | CORRECT for stated regime; Rydberg exception unmentioned | sev-3 |

**PRE-VOTE: YES (MINOR REVISION — 3 sev-3 fixes needed)**

**Required fixes (sev-3, non-blocking for content but needed for precision):**
1. §3.4: Add "(in oscillator units ℏ=mω=1)" before the energy gap formula.
2. §5.2: Replace "Vey product" and "Wick product" with "a star product equivalent to Moyal
   at leading order in ℏ" or define both terms explicitly.
3. §6 OE-P1.6: Add scope qualifier: "for non-Rydberg atomic and solid-state systems."

No sev-1 or sev-2 errors found. Mathematical content is sound throughout.

**Single-agent (mathematician). Two-agent rule met if physicist confirms OE-P1.6 Rydberg scope
OR if these sev-3 items are accepted as MINOR and non-blocking.**

## 8. Critic Second-Agent Review (2026-02-21)

**C8.1 (V3.1-V3.4: CONCUR).** Layer 3 difference and energy gap formula verified. The oscillator-units issue (V3.3) is sev-3 and non-blocking.

**C8.2 (V5.2 Vey/Wick naming: CONCUR).** Naming imprecision confirmed. Vey = formal symplectic deformation (1975), Wick = coherent-state normal ordering. Different objects. Paper uses both loosely. Sev-3, fix is editorial.

**C8.3 (V6.2 Rydberg exception: PARTIALLY CONCUR).**
The Rydberg scaling argument is correct (n^2 enhancement). However, OE-P1.6 already says "parametrically small proportional to hbar^2" — this is TRUE for all n, since the enhancement is n^2 * alpha^2 * hbar^2/8, still proportional to hbar^2. The Rydberg regime makes the PREFACTOR large but does not change the hbar^2 scaling. So the claim is technically correct as stated; it is the numerical accessibility that changes, not the parametric scaling. Downgrade from "exception" to "clarification" — the paper could note that the prefactor grows with n^2 but the scaling remains O(hbar^2).

**C8.4 (Cross-check with pre-vote assessment).**
My pre-vote (proposals/critic-prevote-tier2.md) assessed ordering-equivalence as READY. Previous sev-2 (bibliography gap: DeWitt1957, AliEnglis2005, deGosson2006 missing) was RESOLVED. Current paper has 5 refs including all three. PDM factor-of-2 error was RESOLVED (alpha^2 n/8 at line 139). This BB4 verification confirms the mathematical content is sound.

**C8.5 (Pre-vote: CONCUR with YES, MINOR REVISION).**
All three sev-3 fixes are editorial/presentational. Paper is READY for referee submission.

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT** (mathematician + critic). Pre-vote: YES (MINOR REVISION, sev-3 only).
