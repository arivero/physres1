# Blackboard: Splitting H2.5 (Integrality vs Analyticity vs Transmutation)

Date: 2026-02-09

## Purpose
The Planck-area draft uses H2.5 (“no fractional powers of couplings”) as a **dimension sieve**. This blackboard note separates three distinct constraints that are currently bundled together:
1. **integer-exponent monomials** (integrality / Diophantine),
2. **perturbative analyticity** (Taylor-expandable around a distinguished limit),
3. **allowing RG dimensional transmutation** (non-analytic scale generation).

The goal is to prevent “branch leakage”: conclusions that are true only in one reading of H2.5 accidentally being used in another.

## Baseline: what is forced before H2.5 enters?
From half-density composition + scalarization (H2.1–H2.4 in `papers/planck-area/main.md`):

1. Intrinsic kernels are (bi-)half-densities in the composed-over variable.
2. Any scalar representation \(\psi=f\,\sigma_\ast\) picks a reference half-density \(\sigma_\ast\).
3. If we additionally demand scalar amplitudes \(f\) be **dimensionless**, then \(\sigma_\ast\) must carry a \(\text{length}^{d_{\mathrm{comp}}/2}\) weight.
4. If we further demand \(\sigma_\ast\) be **background-free constant** (no extra \(x\)-dependent structure), this reduces to choosing one global constant \(C\) with dimension \(\text{length}^{d_{\mathrm{comp}}/2}\).

Up to this point, nothing selects *which* constant: the “universal area/length scale” hypothesis begins only once we impose a universality/selection principle for \(C\).

## Split proposal: three knobs

### H2.5a — Integrality (monomial sieve)
Assume \(C\) is a pure monomial in an admitted set of couplings \(\{g_i\}\):
\[
C=\prod_i g_i^{n_i},\qquad n_i\in\mathbb Z.
\]
Then dimension matching is the integer-exponent constraint
\[
\sum_i n_i [g_i] = \frac{d_{\mathrm{comp}}}{2}
\quad\text{(in length exponents).}
\]

Key point: this is a **sieve**, not a uniqueness principle. It can fail to have solutions, have many solutions, or become vacuous if one enlarges the admitted coupling set by redefinitions.

### H2.5b — Perturbative analyticity (stronger)
Assume there is a distinguished weak-coupling limit (e.g. \(G\to 0\), \(g\to 0\)) and \(C\) admits a Taylor expansion around that limit. Then only **nonnegative** integer exponents appear (no negative powers), and “monomial solutions” must sit inside a perturbative analytic structure.

This constraint is stronger than H2.5a and is closer to a physics motivation (“the universal constant should not be non-analytic at the free theory”).

### H2.6 — Transmutation branch (non-analytic scale generation)
Allow RG-generated invariant scales, typically of the form
\[
\Lambda_\ast \sim \mu \exp\!\left(-\int^{g(\mu)}\frac{dg'}{\beta(g')}\right),
\]
so a theory with **dimensionless** couplings can still supply a physical length scale.

This branch is *outside* H2.5a/H2.5b as stated: it is not an integer monomial and not analytic in naive coupling expansions.

## Where “\(D=4\Rightarrow\) area” actually comes from
There are (at least) two logically distinct “area” statements:

1. **Trivial statement:** if \(d_{\mathrm{comp}}=4\), then \(\text{length}^{d_{\mathrm{comp}}/2}=\text{length}^2\) is an area dimension.
   - This is just bookkeeping: it depends only on which variable is being composed over.
2. **Sieve statement:** if the only admitted dimensionful universal coupling is Newton’s constant in \(D\) spacetime dimensions, \([G_D]=\text{length}^{D-2}\), and if we require \(C\) be built as a **monomial without fractional powers** of \(G_D\), then matching \(\text{length}^{D/2}\) forces \(D=4\).
   - This is H2.5a (and even more, “gravity-only admitted couplings”) plus the choice to identify \(d_{\mathrm{comp}}=D\) in a covariant composition.
3. **Transmutation statement:** even without dimensionful couplings, an RG-invariant scale can supply \(C\sim \Lambda_\ast^{-d_{\mathrm{comp}}/2}\).
   - This produces an area in \(d_{\mathrm{comp}}=4\) but does **not** single out \(D=4\); it supplies a scale in any dimension where a transmutation mechanism exists.

## Coupling redefinition invariance (why “what counts as a coupling” matters)
If one is allowed to adjoin new symbols built as fractional powers of existing couplings (e.g. \(\tilde G := G^{1/(D-2)}\)), then “no fractional powers” becomes empty: one has simply renamed the forbidden root as an allowed coupling.

So any meaningful H2.5 must be paired with an admissibility rule, e.g.:
1. couplings are the coefficients multiplying local operators in a canonically normalized action,
2. admissible dependence is analytic near a specified weak-coupling limit,
3. redefinitions must be analytic (power series) in the original couplings.

## Promotion candidates (to manuscripts)
1. **Separation lemma:** “Half-densities force scalarization *choice*, not a specific scale; scale selection begins only after extra universality hypotheses.”
2. **Branch map sentence:** “H2.5 contains at least two inequivalent constraints (integrality vs perturbative analyticity), and dimensional transmutation is a third mechanism that sits outside both.”
3. **Sieve disclaimer:** “\(D=4\) is singled out only under a gravity-only, monomial/integrality reading; allowing additional dimensionful couplings or non-analytic transmutation removes uniqueness.”

## Open checks
1. In the main paper, is \(d_{\mathrm{comp}}\) best read as spatial dimension (time-slicing) or spacetime dimension (covariant composition)? This affects which “\(D=4\)” statement is being made.
2. If we want a physics motivation for H2.5b, what is the correct “distinguished limit” (free theory? \(G\to 0\)? UV completion limit)?
3. If scalarization is a “gauge,” what operational comparisons between theories make a *universal* scalarization convention physically meaningful rather than pure convention?
