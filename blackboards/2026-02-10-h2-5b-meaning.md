# Blackboard: What Can H2.5b (“Perturbative Analyticity”) Mean for Dimensionful Couplings?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Purpose
In `papers/planck-area/main.md`, H2.5b is meant to be stronger than “no fractional powers”: it is supposed to encode a perturbative/analytic dependence requirement.

But for **dimensionful couplings** (e.g. Newton’s constant \(G_D\)), “analytic near zero coupling” is ambiguous unless we specify a reference scale \(\mu\), because “small/large” is only meaningful for *dimensionless* quantities.

This note tries to make H2.5b precise in a way that:
1. does not smuggle in explicit \(\mu\)-dependence,
2. cleanly separates H2.5a (integrality/monomial sieve) from transmutation.

## Setup
Let admitted couplings \(g_i\) have engineering dimensions
\[
[g_i]=\text{length}^{a_i}.
\]
We want a universal scalarization constant \(C\) of dimension
\[
[C]=\text{length}^{d_{\mathrm{comp}}/2}.
\]

H2.5a (integrality) says: \(C=\prod_i g_i^{n_i}\) with integer \(n_i\) (possibly negative), so dimension matching is a Diophantine constraint.

H2.5b wants: “\(C\) is analytic at weak coupling”.

## First ambiguity: “analytic in what?”
For dimensionless couplings (e.g. gauge couplings in 4D), “analytic at \(g=0\)” is clear.
For dimensionful couplings, one must choose a dimensionless parameterization, typically at a scale \(\mu\):
\[
\hat g_i(\mu) := \mu^{-a_i} g_i.
\]
Then “weak coupling” could mean \(\hat g_i(\mu)\to 0\) at fixed \(\mu\).

So a concrete reading of H2.5b is:

> **H2.5b′ (analyticity in dimensionless couplings).**  
> \(C\) can be expressed as a function \(C = \mu^{-d_{\mathrm{comp}}/2}\,F(\{\hat g_i(\mu)\})\) where \(F\) has a Taylor expansion in \(\hat g_i(\mu)\) near \(\hat g_i=0\).

But this introduces \(\mu\) explicitly, which conflicts with the goal that \(C\) be a *universal constant* rather than a \(\mu\)-dependent convention.

So we need an additional constraint.

## Second ambiguity: “no explicit \(\mu\)” vs “RG invariance”
If \(C\) is truly universal, it should not depend on \(\mu\). That leaves two routes:

1. **Engineering-dimension matching by couplings alone.**  
   Use dimensionful couplings in such a way that no \(\mu\) is needed. This is exactly the monomial sieve situation: some monomial in the admitted couplings already has the required dimension.

2. **RG transmutation (non-analytic).**  
   Use a *running* dimensionless coupling \(\hat g(\mu)\) to build an RG-invariant scale
   \(\Lambda_\ast = \mu\,\exp(-\int dg/\beta(g))\), and then set \(C\sim \Lambda_\ast^{-d_{\mathrm{comp}}/2}\).
   This is \(\mu\)-independent by construction, but it is **non-analytic** at weak coupling (essential singularity).

This suggests a clean hygiene statement:

> If H2.5b is interpreted as perturbative analyticity in dimensionless couplings, then any \(\mu\)-independent dimensionful constant \(C\) must come from (i) an engineering-dimension monomial in dimensionful couplings (the sieve), or (ii) non-analytic transmutation (outside H2.5b).

## Why \(D=4\) reappears under H2.5b
Take gravity-only with spacetime dimension \(D\) and \([G_D]=\text{length}^{D-2}\).

If we demand a \(\mu\)-independent constant \(C\) built analytically from \(G_D\) with nonnegative powers, then the only possibility is
\[
C \propto G_D^n,\qquad n\in\mathbb N_0,
\]
and dimension matching requires
\[
n(D-2)=D/2.
\]
This has the unique integer solution \(D=4,\,n=1\) (under the gravity-only assumption).

So the “\(D=4\) sieve” can be read as:
not just “no fractional powers”, but “no explicit \(\mu\)” plus “analytic perturbative dependence” plus “gravity-only admitted couplings”.

## Promotion candidates (to `papers/planck-area/main.md`)
1. **Clarification sentence for H2.5b:**
   “For dimensionful couplings, ‘perturbative analyticity’ is most naturally stated as analyticity in dimensionless couplings at a scale \(\mu\); demanding a \(\mu\)-independent universal constant then forces either an engineering-dimension monomial (H2.5a/b sieve) or a non-analytic transmutation scale (outside H2.5b).”
2. **Interpretation of the \(D=4\) uniqueness:**
   “In the gravity-only case, \(D=4\) is the unique dimension where a \(\mu\)-independent \(\text{length}^{D/2}\) constant can be analytic in the coupling without fractional powers: \(C\sim G_4\).”

## Open questions
1. Should H2.5b be defined relative to \(g(\mu)\to 0\) for dimensionless couplings only, and treated as inapplicable (or replaced by H2.5a) for dimensionful couplings?
2. If we accept RG language inside H2.5b′, does that collapse the distinction between “analytic sieve” and “transmutation branch”, or can we keep them clean by insisting on (non)analyticity as the separator?
