# Wilson Loop Area Law as an Area-Scale Supplier: \(\sigma^{-1}\) in \(D=4\)

Date: 2026-02-10  
Cycle: `S56`

## Purpose
Connect a standard gauge-theory notion of scale (string tension \(\sigma\)) to the half-density scalarization problem:
in \(D=4\), \(\sigma\) has dimension \(\text{length}^{-2}\), so \(\sigma^{-1}\) is an **area**. If \(\sigma\) is an RG-invariant scale generated by compatibility (dimensional transmutation), it can supply the missing area scale without introducing a new fundamental UV parameter.

This note is definitional/organizational, not a claim that confinement is a universal property of Nature.

## 1. Wilson loop, static potential, and area law (definitions)
For a closed loop \(C\), the Wilson loop operator is
\[
W(C)=\frac{1}{N}\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathcal P\exp\!\left(i\oint_C A_\mu\,dx^\mu\right).
\]
In Euclidean signature, the expectation \(\langle W(C)\rangle\) can be used to define the static quark-antiquark potential.
For a large rectangular loop of spatial extent \(R\) and Euclidean time extent \(T\),
\[
V(R) \;=\; -\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\ln \langle W(R\times T)\rangle,
\]
and an **area law**
\[
\langle W(R\times T)\rangle \sim \exp(-\sigma\,R T)
\quad (R,T\ \text{large})
\]
implies a linear potential \(V(R)\sim \sigma R\). Here \(\sigma\) is the string tension.

These definitions and the confinement criterion are standard; see `[Greensite2003Confinement]` for a review-level anchor.

## 2. Dimensional reading: \(\sigma^{-1}\) is an area in \(D=4\)
In \(\hbar=c=1\) units, energy has dimension \(\text{length}^{-1}\), so \(\sigma\) (energy/length) has dimension \(\text{length}^{-2}\).
Thus \(\sigma^{-1}\) is an area scale.

In QCD-like 4D theories, the gauge coupling is dimensionless, so a physical scale \(\Lambda\) (and hence \(\sigma\sim \Lambda^2\)) arises by **dimensional transmutation**: an RG-invariant compatibility scale, not an analytic monomial in couplings.

## 3. Mapping to the half-density scalarization ladder
Our Planck-area draft separates:
1. **Fundamental UV area parameter** \(\alpha_\ast\) (assumed input), vs
2. **Transmutation branch** where an RG-invariant scale is generated by compatibility.

String tension belongs naturally to (2): if a confining sector exists, \(\sigma\) is an emergent invariant with dimension \(\text{length}^{-2}\), hence a candidate supplier of an area scale \(\sigma^{-1}\) for scalarization conventions.

This does not prove universality of \(\sigma\) across sectors; it only records that the dimensions match and the scale mechanism is aligned with the project’s "RG as refinement compatibility" thesis.

## Promotion target (for `C82`)
Add a short paragraph near `Remark E4a` in `papers/planck-area/main.md`:
- define \(V(R)\) from rectangular Wilson loops,
- state area law \(\Rightarrow\) string tension \(\sigma\) (and \(\sigma^{-1}\) as an area),
- label it explicitly as the transmutation scale-supplier branch (not a new fundamental postulate),
- cite `[Greensite2003Confinement]` (and optionally `[Wilson1974Confinement]` for attribution, if OA status is resolved later).
