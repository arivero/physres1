# Blackboards (Exploratory Notes)

This folder is for “scratchpad” research: computations, conjectures, counterexamples,
and idea sketches that are not yet stable enough to live in a manuscript draft.

## Rules
1. These notes are **not citable sources**.
2. They may reference `conv_patched.md` as an idea generator, but nothing here should be cited as evidence.
3. When an argument stabilizes, promote it into:
   - `paper/notes/` (for longer derivations supporting `paper/main.md`), or
   - a draft (`paper/main.md` or `papers/*/main.md`) with proper external citations as needed.

## Naming
Prefer dated files:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
