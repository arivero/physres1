# Blackboards (Exploratory Notes)

This folder is for "scratchpad" research: computations, conjectures, counterexamples,
and idea sketches that are not yet stable enough to live in a manuscript draft.

## Hard Limit: 7 Blackboards (0–6)

Blackboards are numbered **0.md through 6.md** — no content hints in filenames.
Max **300 lines** per blackboard. Blackboards can be edited (unlike notebooks).
When all 7 slots are occupied and a new topic is needed, **overwrite** the least
relevant slot. Deletion criteria (in priority order):

1. **Already promoted** — content has been absorbed into a manuscript. Overwrite freely.
2. **Superseded** — a newer board covers the same ground. Overwrite the older one.
3. **Stale** — no sign of active use. Overwrite.
4. **Lowest priority** — least aligned with the current top thread.

## Rules
1. The blackboards are **not citable sources**.
2. They may reference idea logs, but nothing here should be cited as evidence.
3. When an argument stabilizes, promote it into a **paper** (if in a Cxxx task) or **notebook**.
   - **Paper** (`paper/`, `papers/*/`): editable, aimed for publication.
   - **Notebook** (`notebooks/`) : append-only (add content or discard fully, no edits), not aimed for publication.
4. Promotion is the exit path. Once fully promoted, a slot is free for reuse.
