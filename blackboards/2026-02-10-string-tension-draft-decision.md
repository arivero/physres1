# Decision Memo: Dedicated String-Tension Draft?

Date: 2026-02-10  
Cycle: `S57`

## Current assets
- OA anchor for Wilson-loop/area-law/string-tension language: `[Greensite2003Confinement]`.
- Hypothesis-separated paragraph added in `papers/planck-area/main.md` (`Remark E4a`).
- Internal bridge note mapping \(\sigma^{-1}\) to the area-scale supplier ladder (`S56`).

## Missing for a new paper
We do not yet have a technical section that goes beyond:
- definitions (Wilson loop, area law),
- dimensional matching (\([\sigma]=\text{length}^{-2}\)).

What would count as "technical" here:
- an explicit connection between a kernel/half-density normalization requirement and an area law,
- a refinement/composition statement for rectangular loops that mirrors our semigroup arguments,
- or a concrete model where \(\sigma\) enters a scalarization gauge in a controlled way.

## Decision
Keep the string-tension option as a bounded scale-supplier branch inside `papers/planck-area/main.md` for now.
Revisit opening a dedicated draft only after producing one nontrivial technical section worth publishing.
