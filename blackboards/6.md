# Path-Integral Normalization: Mathematical Verification (Pre-Vote)

## 1. Core Claim: d/2 Forcing (§2.2, PN-D1.2)

**Claim:** Composition K(x,z;t₁+t₂) = ∫ d^d y K(x,y;t₁)K(y,z;t₂) forces exponent α = d/2.

**Derivation PN-D1.2 check:**
K_α(x,y;t) = (m/2πiℏt)^α exp(im|x-y|²/2ℏt)

∫ d^d y K_α(x,y;t₁) K_α(y,z;t₂) ∝ (t₁t₂)^{-α} × (Gaussian integral) × (t₁+t₂)^{-d/2}

For composition closure: (t₁t₂)^{-α}(t₁+t₂)^{-d/2} ∝ (t₁+t₂)^{-α}

This requires (t₁t₂)^{-α} ∝ (t₁+t₂)^{-(α-d/2)}.

But (t₁t₂)^{-α} is NOT a function of (t₁+t₂) alone unless α = 0 OR the only way closure holds is α = d/2.

**FLAG (sev-2):** The derivation as written has a gap. The claim is:

> "(t₁ t₂)^{-α} (t₁+t₂)^{-d/2} ∝ (t₁+t₂)^{-α}"

This cannot hold for all t₁, t₂ > 0 by dimensional analysis: the LHS is a product of two
different functional forms. The correct argument is:

After the Gaussian integral, total prefactor = (m/2πiℏ)^{2α} (t₁t₂)^{-α} × (2πiℏ/m)^{d/2} (t₁+t₂)^{d/2}/(t₁t₂)^{d/2} × ...

Wait — let me recompute. For d=1, α=1/2:
∫ dy (m/2πiℏt₁)^{1/2} e^{im(x-y)²/2ℏt₁} (m/2πiℏt₂)^{1/2} e^{im(y-z)²/2ℏt₂}
= (m/2πiℏ) (t₁t₂)^{-1/2} × (πiℏ(t₁+t₂)/m t₁t₂)^{1/2} × exp(im(x-z)²/2ℏ(t₁+t₂))

Wait: Gaussian ∫ dy exp(-α(y-y*)²) = (π/α)^{1/2} with α = im(t₁+t₂)/(2ℏt₁t₂).
Factor = (π/α)^{1/2} = (2πiℏt₁t₂/m(t₁+t₂))^{1/2}.

Full prefactor: (m/2πiℏ)(t₁t₂)^{-1/2} × (2πiℏt₁t₂/m(t₁+t₂))^{1/2}
= (m/2πiℏ)(t₁t₂)^{-1/2} × (2πiℏ/m)^{1/2} (t₁t₂)^{1/2} (t₁+t₂)^{-1/2}
= (m/2πiℏ) × (2πiℏ/m)^{1/2} × (t₁+t₂)^{-1/2}
= (m/2πiℏ(t₁+t₂))^{1/2} ✓

For general α ≠ d/2 in d dimensions:
∫ d^d y K_α K_α = (m/2πiℏ)^{2α} (t₁t₂)^{-α} × (2πiℏ/m)^{d/2} (t₁t₂)^{d/2} (t₁+t₂)^{-d/2}
= (m/2πiℏ)^{2α-d/2} (t₁t₂)^{d/2-α} (t₁+t₂)^{-d/2}

For this to equal K_α(x,z;t₁+t₂) = (m/2πiℏ(t₁+t₂))^α:
(m/2πiℏ)^{2α-d/2} (t₁t₂)^{d/2-α} (t₁+t₂)^{-d/2} = (m/2πiℏ)^α (t₁+t₂)^{-α}

LHS has factor (t₁t₂)^{d/2-α} which equals (t₁+t₂)^{d/2-α} only if t₁t₂/(t₁+t₂)^2 is constant
(which it's not for all t₁,t₂ > 0). So:

**For closure we need d/2-α = 0 AND (2α-d/2 = α), both give α = d/2. ✓**

The paper's statement of PN-D1.2 is CORRECT but the prose is compressed. The explicit
computation above (which the paper DOES give for d=1 in PN-D1.1) shows closure. The
"proportionality" in PN-D1.2 should read "the result equals K_α(t₁+t₂) if and only if."

**V1.1 FLAG (sev-3):** PN-D1.2 prose says "∝" but should say "= K_α(t₁+t₂) iff α=d/2."
Mathematical content is CORRECT; precision of language is sev-3.

## 2. Proposition PN-P1.3 (Groupoid-Convolution Derivation, §2.3)

**Claim:** (C)+(T)+(D)+(M) → ĥ(p;t) = exp(t·φ(p)) → composition forces d/2 for Gaussian φ.

**V2.1 VERIFIED:** Cauchy's functional equation for log ĥ(p;t):
f(t₁)+f(t₂) = f(t₁+t₂) → f(t) = t·φ(p) (measurability hypothesis (M) → linearity). ✓

**V2.2 VERIFIED:** Inverse Fourier of exp(-cp²t):
∫ d^d p/(2π)^d exp(ip·x - cp²t) = (4πct)^{-d/2} exp(-|x|²/4ct). ✓
The normalization N(t) ∝ t^{-d/2} follows. ✓

**V2.3 VERIFIED:** Lévy exclusion for α≠2 stable processes: [c_α] = [ℏ/m]^{α/(α-1)}
(from dimensional analysis of exp(-c_α|p|^α t)); for α≠2, [c_α] ≠ [ℏ/m] in any combination of
{m, ℏ}. The paper invokes [RCPFoundations] P4.2 for this step; the step itself is standard. ✓

## 3. Van Vleck Determinant Composition (§4, PN-D4.1)

**Claim (§4.2):** Δ(x,z) = Δ(x,y_*)·Δ(y_*,z) (multiplicativity at the stationary point).

**V3.1 VERIFIED:** This is the DeWitt-Morette 1951/1957 result. Standard. ✓

**V3.2 FLAG (sev-3):** PN-D4.1 says the Gaussian fluctuation integral yields
"(t₁t₂)^{d/2}/(t₁+t₂)^{d/2}".

Let me check: in curved space around y_*, the quadratic action in δy is
δ²S = (1/2) S_{ij}(y_*) δy^i δy^j with S_{ij} = -∂²S_cl/∂y^i∂y^j.

The Gaussian integral ∫ d^d(δy) exp(i δ²S/ℏ) = (2πiℏ)^{d/2}/det(S_{ij})^{1/2}

But S_{ij}(y_*) depends on the metric and geodesic — it is NOT simply (m/t₁t₂)(t₁+t₂) δ_{ij}
as in flat space. The Van Vleck factor Δ = det(-∂²S_cl/∂x∂y) absorbs this geometric piece.

**The paper invokes DeWitt-Morette multiplicativity and states the flat-space factor remains.**
This is correct at the level stated: Δ(x,y_*)Δ(y_*,z) = Δ(x,z) absorbs ALL the curved-space
Jacobian, leaving exactly the flat-space Gaussian factor (which gives the t-dependent prefactor).
The paper correctly identifies this as the "same calculation as in flat space, Section 2.1."

**V3.2 VERIFIED:** Argument is correct and self-consistent. ✓

**V3.3 FLAG (sev-3):** Proposition PN-P4.1 says the result is "at leading semiclassical order."
The paper then adds: "higher-order Seeley-DeWitt corrections ... do not modify the leading t^{-d/2}
singularity, so the exponent is exact even though the Van Vleck derivation is semiclassical."

This is correct but needs precision: "exact exponent" means the LEADING t-power, not the prefactor.
The phrase "the exponent is exact" could be misread as "the entire formula is exact." Sev-3.

## 4. §5 Heat Kernel: Diffusion Equation Verification (PN-D5.1)

**Claim:** ∂H₀/∂τ = (ℏ/2m)·Δ_x H₀

**V4.1 VERIFIED EXPLICITLY:**
H₀ = (m/2πℏτ)^{d/2} exp(-m|x-y|²/2ℏτ)

∂H₀/∂τ = H₀[-d/2τ + m|x-y|²/2ℏτ²] ✓

Δ_x H₀ = H₀[-md/ℏτ + m²|x-y|²/ℏ²τ²]

(ℏ/2m)Δ_x H₀ = H₀[-d/2τ + m|x-y|²/2ℏτ²] ✓

Match. ✓

## 5. §6 Renormalization Threshold (PN-D6.1)

**Claim:** G₀(0,0;E) = (m/2πiℏ)^{d/2} ∫₀^∞ dt t^{-d/2} e^{iEt/ℏ} diverges at t→0 iff d≥2.

**V5.1 VERIFIED:** ∫₀^ε t^{-d/2} dt:
- d<2: converges (exponent -d/2 > -1) ✓
- d=2: logarithmic (∫ dt/t) ✓
- d>2: power-law (∫ dt t^{-d/2}, exponent < -1) ✓

**V5.2 FLAG (sev-2):** The paper states:

> "G₀(x,x;E) = ∫₀^∞ dt K₀(x,x;t) e^{iEt/ℏ}"

But K₀ is the Schrödinger propagator (Minkowski signature). The integral ∫₀^∞ dt K₀ e^{iEt/ℏ}
does not converge for real E (K₀(x,x;t) = (m/2πiℏt)^{d/2} oscillates and |K₀| = (m/2πℏt)^{d/2}
diverges as t→0). The correct definition requires either:
(a) Euclidean (Wick-rotated) Green function: G_E(x,x;E) = ∫₀^∞ dτ H₀(x,x;τ) e^{-Eτ/ℏ},
    convergent for E>0.
(b) Minkowski with iε prescription: e^{i(E+iε)t/ℏ}, ε→0⁺.

The paper uses (b) implicitly — the standard iε prescription. This is conventional in QM
textbooks. But the formula as written (§6.1) does NOT display the iε, so the integral appears
ill-defined for a careful reader.

**This is a real precision issue.** The UV divergence analysis (§6.2) is performed on
∫₀^ε t^{-d/2} dt which comes from the Euclidean heat kernel, not the Minkowski propagator.
The paper conflates:
1. Minkowski K₀(x,x;t) = (m/2πiℏt)^{d/2}: has |K₀| ~ t^{-d/2} so UV integral ∫ t^{-d/2} still diverges.
2. Euclidean H₀(x,x;τ) = (m/2πℏτ)^{d/2}: same power-law in τ.

The convergence analysis is correct for BOTH, but the formula in §6.1 needs +iε or "Euclidean."

**Severity: sev-2.** The mathematical content (UV divergence structure, d<2/d=2/d>2 hierarchy)
is CORRECT. The formula missing iε is a precision gap that a referee would catch.

## 6. §7 Open Questions: Fractional Dimensions (§7.4 item 1)

**Claim:** "For fractal geometries (non-integer Hausdorff dimension d_H), the heat kernel
satisfies K_t(x,y) ~ t^{-d_s/2} where d_s is the spectral dimension (not d_H). The
composition semigroup still holds."

**V6.1 PARTIALLY VERIFIED:** Standard result (Barlow-Bass 1989, Kigami-Lapidus 1993 for p.c.f.
fractals). The spectral dimension d_s governs the return probability K_t(x,x) ~ t^{-d_s/2}. ✓

**V6.2 FLAG (sev-3):** "The composition semigroup still holds" — for regular fractals with a
self-similar Laplacian, yes. For arbitrary fractal spaces, the heat semigroup (Markov kernel)
may not satisfy the standard composition law without additional structure. The paper should
say "for regular self-similar fractals" or cite a specific class.

## 7. Overall Verdict

| Section | Status | Severity |
|---------|--------|----------|
| §2.2 d/2 forcing (PN-D1.2) | CORRECT; "∝" prose imprecise | sev-3 |
| §2.3 groupoid convolution | VERIFIED ✓ (standard) | — |
| §3 dimensional analysis | VERIFIED ✓ | — |
| §4.1 Van Vleck geometric meaning | VERIFIED ✓ | — |
| §4.2 DeWitt-Morette composition | VERIFIED ✓ (standard) | — |
| PN-P4.1 "exponent exact" | CORRECT with caveat: leading exponent exact, prefactor semiclassical | sev-3 |
| §5 heat kernel / diffusion eq | VERIFIED ✓ (explicit computation) | — |
| §6.1 Green function formula | MISSING iε prescription (convergence issue) | **sev-2** |

**PRE-VOTE: YES (MINOR REVISION — 1 sev-2, 3 sev-3)**

**Required fixes:**
1. **(sev-2) §6.1:** Add "+iε" or "Euclidean" qualifier to Green function formula.
   Recommend: replace "K₀(x,x;t) e^{iEt/ℏ}" with "H₀(x,x;τ) e^{-Eτ/ℏ}" (Euclidean form),
   or add "(with iε prescription, E → E+iε, ε→0⁺)" after the formula.
2. **(sev-3) §2.2 (PN-D1.2):** Replace "∝" with "equals K_α(t₁+t₂) if and only if α=d/2."
3. **(sev-3) PN-P4.1:** Clarify "exact exponent" means the leading t-power is exact; add
   "(leading power exact; subleading corrections are O(ℏ²) and do not affect the d/2 exponent)."
4. **(sev-3) §7.4:** Replace "for fractal geometries" with "for regular self-similar fractals."

No sev-1 errors. The core argument (composition forces d/2) is mathematically sound and novel.
The connection (temporal composition / curved space / Euclidean diffusion / RG threshold) is
a genuine unification.

**Single-agent (mathematician). Two-agent rule: needs physicist for physical interpretation
of sev-2 (iε prescription context) and sev-3 (PN-P4.1 semiclassical accuracy claim).**

## 8. Critic Second-Agent Review (2026-02-21)

**C8.1 (V5.2 iε sev-2: CONCUR).** The Green function formula in §6.1 is indeed missing the iε prescription. Standard in physics textbooks but a legitimate precision issue for a paper claiming mathematical rigor. The fix is trivial (add "(E→E+iε, ε→0⁺)" or switch to Euclidean). Sev-2 confirmed.

**C8.2 (V1.1 PN-D1.2 "∝" imprecision: CONCUR).** The derivation is correct; the language should be "equals ... if and only if." Sev-3 editorial fix.

**C8.3 (V3.3 "exact exponent": CONCUR with nuance).** The claim "exponent is exact" IS correctly limited in the paper to the leading t-power (d/2). But reader confusion is possible. Adding "leading power exact" is a simple clarification.

**C8.4 (V6.2 fractal scope: CONCUR).** For p.c.f. (post-critically finite) self-similar fractals, the heat kernel semigroup law holds. For general fractal spaces (e.g., random fractals), additional regularity is needed. Scope qualification warranted.

**C8.5 (Cross-check with pre-vote assessment).**
My pre-vote (proposals/critic-prevote-remaining.md) assessed path-integral-normalization as READY. The previous sev-1 bibliography gap was RESOLVED (5 external refs added: VanVleck1928, Morette1951, DeWitt1957, Vassilevich2003, FeynmanHibbs1965). The iε sev-2 found here is new but non-blocking — trivial fix.

**C8.6 (Pre-vote: CONCUR with YES, MINOR REVISION).**
The sev-2 iε issue is the only substantive concern and requires a one-line fix. Paper is READY after that fix.

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT** (mathematician + critic). Pre-vote: YES (MINOR REVISION).
