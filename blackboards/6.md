# Efimov/PSL(2,R) Verification (Task #5)

## 1. s0 from transcendental equation

**Equation** (Efimov 1970, Braaten-Hammer 2006):
$$s_0 \cosh(\pi s_0/2) = \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}} \sinh(\pi s_0/6)$$

**Command:**
```python
from scipy.optimize import brentq
import math
f = lambda s: -s*math.cosh(math.pi*s/2) + (8/math.sqrt(3))*math.sinh(math.pi*s/6)
s0 = brentq(f, 0.5, 1.5, xtol=1e-15)
```

**Result:** `s0 = 1.006237825102782`, residual `8.88e-16`.
Matches literature `1.00624` to 5 sig. figs.

## 2. Scaling ratios

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| `lambda = exp(pi/s0)` | `22.6943825954` |
| `lambda^2 = exp(2*pi/s0)` | `515.035001` |
| `E_1/E_0 = exp(-2*pi/s0)` | `1.9416e-03` |

Kraemer et al. (2006, Cs-133): `lambda ~ 22.7`. Agreement `0.02%`.

## 3. Inverse-square potential

Effective hyperradial coupling: `alpha = s0^2 + 1/4 = 1.2625`.
$$V_{\text{eff}}(R) = -(s_0^2 + \tfrac{1}{4})/R^2$$

Wavefunction: `psi ~ R^{1/2} sin(s0 ln(R/R*) + delta)`.
Log-oscillation period: `2*pi/s0 = 6.2442`.

## 4. Möbius/SL(2,R) eigenstructure

Rotation angle: `theta = pi/s0 = 3.12212 rad`.
Trace: `tr(M) = 2*cos(theta) = -1.99962`.
`|tr| < 2` => **ELLIPTIC** element of SL(2,R).

Eigenvalues: `exp(+/-i*theta)` on unit circle.
```
lambda_+ = -0.999810 + 0.019474i
lambda_- = -0.999810 - 0.019474i
|lambda| = 1, det = 1.
```

SL(2,R) matrix (elliptic conjugacy class):
```
M = [[-0.99981,  0.01947],
     [-0.01947, -0.99981]]
```

## 5. PSL(2,R) representation theory

Casimir (principal series): `C = s^2 + 1/4`.
Efimov coupling: `alpha = s0^2 + 1/4 = 1.2625 = C(s0)`.
**=> s0 IS the PSL(2,R) spectral parameter.**

Conformal weight: `Delta = 1/2 + i*s0 = 0.5 + 1.006i` (critical line).

SAE angle evolution: `phi' = phi + s0*ln(Lambda'/Lambda) (mod pi)`.
Period: `pi/s0 = theta = 3.12212`. **Consistent.**

## 6. Cross-checks (all PASS)

| Check | LHS | RHS | |diff| |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alt. form | `s0` | `(8/sqrt(3))*sinh/cosh` | `2.2e-16` |
| Node count | `s0*pi/s0` | `pi` | `0` |
| `lambda^2` vs `exp(2pi/s0)` | `515.035` | `515.035` | `0` |

## 7. Proposal verdict

**Q1 (PSL(2,R) <-> Efimov tower): CONFIRMED.**
s0 = PSL(2,R) spectral parameter. Limit cycle = elliptic SL(2,R) orbit. Log-periodic spectrum from theta = pi/s0.

**Q2 (exp(pi/s0) representation-theoretic): CONFIRMED with CAVEAT.**
Scaling ratio = exp(SL(2,R) rotation angle). But s0 requires STM physics input — not purely group-theoretic.

**Q3 (RCP scale channel): PLAUSIBLE, PARTIAL.**
Hille-Yosida semigroup interpretation structurally correct. But this is standard RG + inverse-square physics, not a new RCP-forced result. **Overclaim risk** if proposal implies RCP forces the limit cycle.

## 8. Sev-graded assessment of proposal claims

| Claim | Sev | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| s0 determines Efimov via transcendental eq | sev-0 | VERIFIED (textbook) |
| Möbius transformation is universal for regulators | sev-0 | CONFIRMED (arXiv:2509.04746) |
| SL(2,R) elliptic element identification | sev-1 | VERIFIED (theta = pi/s0, |tr|<2) |
| s0 = PSL(2,R) spectral parameter | sev-1 | VERIFIED (Casimir match) |
| SAE parametrization = PSL(2,R) action | sev-2 | CORRECT but standard (Camblong et al.) |
| exp(pi/s0) is "representation-theoretic" | sev-2 | PARTIALLY TRUE — angle is, but value needs physics |
| Hille-Yosida semigroup for scale channel | sev-2 | PLAUSIBLE framework, not new |
| RCP forces limit cycle | sev-3 | OVERCLAIM — RCP compatible, not forcing |
| Groupoid lifting to RCP | sev-3 | SPECULATIVE — no concrete construction |

## 9. Critic Second-Agent Review (2026-02-21)

<!-- Critic: -->

**C9.1 Numerical verification:** CONCUR. s0=1.00624 matches literature. Cross-checks pass.

**C9.2 Overclaim assessment (Q3):** CONCUR with computationalist's sev-3 rating.
The Efimov limit cycle is SL(2,R) physics (Camblong et al. 2000-2003, well-known).
Calling this "RCP-forced" would conflate "compatible with RCP framework" with "derived from RCP."
The limit cycle exists whether or not you frame it in RCP language.
**Proposed safe language:** "The Efimov limit cycle is a concrete realization of the scale
channel (A4) in which discrete scale invariance replaces continuous; it demonstrates that
the RCP taxonomy accommodates both."

**C9.3 Promotion readiness:**
- Q1+Q2: ready as notebook entry (group-theory reading of known physics).
- Q3: NOT ready for manuscript promotion (overclaim risk, no new result).
- Salvage: one Remark in cornerstone §9 or rcp-foundations could note the SL(2,R)
  structure as a scale-channel illustration, without claiming RCP forces it.

**STATUS: TWO-AGENT** (computationalist + critic). Q1+Q2 verified. Q3 overclaim confirmed.

## 10. Physicist Third-Agent Review (2026-02-21)

<!-- Physicist: -->

**P10.1 s0 value and transcendental equation: CONFIRMED.**
Standard Efimov physics. The equation arises from matching hyperradial wavefunctions at the STM boundary; s0 is the single real root for identical bosons. For non-identical particles (mass ratio A), the equation generalizes and s0(A) varies. s0 = 1.00624 is the equal-mass value.

**P10.2 SL(2,R) identification: CORRECT but NOT NEW.**
The 1/R^2 potential has SO(2,1) ~ SL(2,R) dynamical symmetry — this is de Alfaro, Fubini, Furlan (1976), not a discovery of this project. Camblong, Ordonez et al. (2000-2003) explicitly connected it to Efimov. The computationalist's theta = pi/s0, |tr(M)| < 2 (elliptic) is a correct classification of the conjugacy class.

**P10.3 Physical interpretation — the three key facts:**
(a) The inverse-square potential is conformally invariant in 1D (the hyperradial equation). Its Hamiltonian commutes with the generators of SO(2,1).
(b) Quantum-mechanically, the strong coupling regime (alpha > 1/4, i.e., "fall to center") requires a self-adjoint extension parametrized by one angle theta in [0,pi). This theta IS the Efimov three-body parameter.
(c) The RG limit cycle is the periodic orbit: as the UV cutoff Lambda cycles through exp(pi/s0), the SAE parameter theta returns to its initial value. This is an elliptic element of PSL(2,R) acting on the circle of SAE parameters.

All three are standard textbook material (Braaten-Hammer 2006 review, Nishida-Son 2007 for the CFT perspective).

**P10.4 Q3 (RCP forces limit cycle) — CONCUR with sev-3 OVERCLAIM:**
The limit cycle is forced by:
(i) Resonant two-body interactions (|a| -> infinity)
(ii) Three-body Efimov channel coupling (STM equation)
(iii) UV incompleteness of the effective theory (need three-body counterterm)

None of these are RCP inputs. RCP's scale channel can DESCRIBE the limit cycle (it is a semigroup orbit), but does not PREDICT or FORCE it. The student's proposal language "RCP forces the limit cycle" conflates framework and prediction.

**Safe language (concur with critic C9.2):** "The Efimov limit cycle realizes discrete scale invariance within the RCP scale channel, demonstrating that the compositional framework accommodates non-fixed-point RG behavior."

**P10.5 Connection to paper — where this could go:**
- One Remark in §9/10 noting that D9.1f (SAE witness) extends naturally to the 1/R^2 Efimov setting
- The SAE parameter theta in D9.1f is the SAME mathematical object as the Efimov three-body parameter
- This would connect two existing paper elements (SAE + scale channel) without overclaiming

**P10.6 Physics verdict:**

| Claim | Physics assessment |
|---|---|
| s0 numeric value | TEXTBOOK |
| Elliptic SL(2,R) | CORRECT, NOT NEW |
| SAE = PSL(2,R) orbit | CORRECT, de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan 1976 |
| Limit cycle from 1/R^2 | CORRECT, Camblong et al. 2000 |
| RCP forces limit cycle | OVERCLAIM — RCP accommodates, does not force |
| Groupoid lifting | SPECULATIVE — no concrete construction |

**P10.7 Promotion recommendation:**
- Q1+Q2: promote as notebook entry (verified group-theory reading of known physics)
- Q3: DO NOT promote to paper (overclaim risk)
- Possible paper Remark: connect D9.1f (SAE) to Efimov as a natural example, without RCP-forcing claim

**STATUS: THREE-AGENT** (computationalist + critic + physicist). All concur on Q1+Q2 VERIFIED, Q3 OVERCLAIM.
