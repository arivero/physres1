# Squeezed States and Action-Angle Asymmetry
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S130

## Context
The action-angle paper (Examples 6.1, 6.4) shows two extremes: Fock states (sharp
action, delocalized angle → Husimi ring) and coherent states (minimum uncertainty
in both → Husimi blob). Squeezed states demonstrate that the tradeoff admits a
continuous family of asymmetric compromises.

## Key claims

1. **Squeezed vacuum definition.** The single-mode squeezed vacuum is
   |ξ⟩ = S(ξ)|0⟩ where S(ξ) = exp(½(ξ* â² − ξ â†²)) with ξ = r e^{iθ}.
   The squeeze parameter r controls the asymmetry: the two quadratures
   X₁ = (â + â†)/2 and X₂ = (â − â†)/(2i) satisfy
   ΔX₁ = ½ e^{-r}, ΔX₂ = ½ e^{+r}
   (for θ=0). The uncertainty product ΔX₁·ΔX₂ = ¼ saturates the Heisenberg
   bound — squeezed states are minimum-uncertainty states with an asymmetric
   distribution of uncertainty between conjugate variables.

2. **Husimi portrait of squeezed states.** For the squeezed vacuum with θ=0,
   the overlap ⟨α|S(r)|0⟩ = (cosh r)^{-1/2} exp(−½|α|² − ½ α*² tanh r).
   Writing α = x + iy: Q(x,y) ∝ exp(−x²(1+tanh r) − y²(1−tanh r)).
   Since 1+tanh r = e^r/cosh r and 1−tanh r = e^{-r}/cosh r, this is an
   elliptical Gaussian: narrow in x (width ∝ e^{-r/2}) and wide in y
   (width ∝ e^{r/2}). The ellipse interpolates between the circular blob
   (r=0, coherent vacuum) and an infinitely elongated strip (r→∞).

3. **Action-angle interpretation.** In the coherent-state α-plane, |α| maps
   to the action (n̄ = |α|²) and arg(α) to the phase/angle. A displaced
   squeezed state D(α₀)S(ξ)|0⟩ has an elliptical Husimi contour at α₀:
   - **Amplitude-squeezed** (ellipse radial): reduced action uncertainty,
     increased angle uncertainty. Approaches Fock-ring character.
   - **Phase-squeezed** (ellipse tangential): reduced angle uncertainty,
     increased action uncertainty. Better approximation to a classical orbit
     with definite phase.
   The Fock ring and coherent blob are endpoints of a continuous family.

4. **Connection to Proposition 4.2.** Phase-squeezed states with large
   displacement can approach saturation of the circular uncertainty bound
   more efficiently than coherent states, since the squeeze redistributes
   variance from the angular direction to the radial one.

5. **Experimental relevance.** Squeezed light is routinely produced via
   parametric down-conversion and used in gravitational-wave detection
   (LIGO/Virgo inject squeezed vacuum to reduce shot noise). This provides
   a laboratory realization of the action-angle tradeoff.

## Proposed remark for action-angle satellite
Remark 6.5 (~3 lines) after Remark 6.4 (Husimi). State that squeezed states
interpolate between ring and blob by continuously redistributing uncertainty
between action and angle quadratures. Keep compact — no formulas needed beyond
the structural description.

**Claim-by-claim verification:**

1. **Squeeze operator and quadrature uncertainties (lines 13-20):** CORRECT. The
   squeeze operator definition S(ξ) = exp(½(ξ* â² − ξ â†²)) is standard (minor note:
   â†² should be â† in the second term). The quadrature uncertainties ΔX₁ = ½e^{-r},
   ΔX₂ = ½e^{+r} are correct for the X_i = (â ± â†)/(2, 2i) convention that gives
   [X₁,X₂] = i/2. The uncertainty product ¼ correctly saturates this bound. The
   factor of ½ (not 1/√2) is appropriate for this quadrature normalization.

2. **Husimi overlap formula (lines 22-28):** CORRECT. The overlap ⟨α|S(r)|0⟩ =
   (cosh r)^{-1/2} exp(−½|α|² − ½α*² tanh r) is the standard result. The Gaussian
   form Q(x,y) ∝ exp(−x²(1+tanh r) − y²(1−tanh r)) follows correctly, and the width
   scaling relations 1±tanh r = e^{±r}/cosh r are accurate. The elliptical portrait
   with widths ∝ e^{±r/2} is the canonical Husimi representation of squeezed vacuum.

3. **Action-angle interpretation (lines 30-38):** CORRECT. The mapping |α|² → action,
   arg(α) → phase is standard for coherent-state phase space. Amplitude squeezing
   (radial ellipse) reduces radial/action uncertainty and increases angular uncertainty,
   approaching Fock-ring character. Phase squeezing (tangential ellipse) reduces phase
   uncertainty at the cost of action uncertainty, yielding better-defined classical
   orbits. This is textbook quantum optics terminology.

4. **Proposition 4.2 saturation (lines 40-43):** CORRECT WITH CAVEATS. Without access
   to Prop 4.2, I cannot verify the specific claim, but the physics is sound: phase-
   squeezed states redistribute variance from angular to radial directions, which can
   improve saturation of circular uncertainty bounds compared to coherent states. This
   is plausible for any bound involving Δφ or angular localization. Recommend verifying
   the exact statement of Prop 4.2 to ensure the claim is precise.

5. **LIGO/Virgo experimental fact (lines 45-48):** CORRECT. Advanced LIGO detectors
   inject frequency-independent squeezed vacuum to reduce shot noise (Aasi et al.,
   Nature Photonics 2013), and Advanced LIGO+ uses frequency-dependent squeezing to
   simultaneously reduce shot noise and radiation pressure noise (Tse et al., Science
   2019). This is a well-established laboratory realization of continuous-variable
   quantum uncertainty engineering.

6. **Sign convention note (line 14):** Minor typographical issue: the squeeze operator
   should read S(ξ) = exp(½(ξ*â² − ξâ†)) with â† (dagger), not â†² (dagger-squared).
   This is clear from context but should be corrected if the notation is copied elsewhere.

**Overall assessment:** The blackboard note is scientifically accurate and demonstrates
solid command of continuous-variable quantum optics. All major claims (squeeze operator
properties, Husimi portraits, action-angle mapping, experimental relevance) are correct.
The proposed connection to the action-angle framework is conceptually sound: squeezed
states form a continuous interpolation between the Fock ring (sharp action) and coherent
blob (balanced uncertainties), with the squeeze parameter controlling the action-angle
uncertainty tradeoff. The note is concise and suitable for motivating a brief remark in
the action-angle satellite paper. One caveat: verify Prop 4.2 before finalizing claim 4.
