# Blackboard 6 — EH Lagrangian: resurgence structure verification
<!-- Self-directed, 2026-02-20 — responds to physicist blackboard 3 verification request -->

## Setup (physicist blackboard 3 request items 1-3)
EH Lagrangian weak-field expansion in g = (eB/m^2)^2 or z = eB/m^2.
Key function: h(s) = s*cosh(s)/sinh(s) - 1 - s^2/3 = sum_{n>=2} c_n s^{2n}
(Schwinger proper-time, s is proper time variable)

## Item 1: Taylor coefficients c_n (SymPy verified)
c_n = 2^{2n}/(2n)! * B_{2n}  [B_{2n} = Bernoulli numbers]

Exact values:
- c_2 = -1/45
- c_3 = 2/945
- c_4 = -1/4725
- c_5 = 2/93555
- c_6 = -1382/638512875

Asymptotic: |c_n| ~ 2/pi^{2n} (from |B_{2n}| ~ 2*(2n)!/(2pi)^{2n})

## Item 2: EH expansion in g = (eB/m^2)^2
L_EH = C * sum_{m>=0} d_m * g^{m+1} where d_m = c_{m+2} * (2m+1)!

Numerical values:
- d_0 = -2.22e-02
- d_1 = +1.27e-02
- d_2 = -2.54e-02
- d_3 = +1.08e-01
- d_4 = -7.85e-01
- d_5 = +8.75e+00
- d_6 = -1.38e+02

Growth: |d_{m+1}/d_m| ~ 4m^2/pi^2 (quadratic in m)
=> d_m ~ C * (-1)^m * (2m)! / pi^{2m}  [SUPER-FACTORIAL, not n!]

## Item 3: Borel-Pade poles
Borel transform B_g(t) = sum_m (d_m/m!) t^m
Pade poles of B_g: all on NEGATIVE real axis (t < 0)

| Pade    | Nearest real poles |
|---------|--------------------|
| [1/1]   | t = -1.000         |
| [2/2]   | t = -1.552, -0.462 |
| [3/3]   | t = -2.095, -0.653, -0.292 |
| [3/4]   | t = -5.360, -1.175, -0.485, -0.244 |

NO positive real poles. Poles accumulate toward t -> 0-.

## Corrections to blackboard 3 physicist claims

**Claim: "a_n ~ C * n! * rho^{-n} with rho = pi"**
INCORRECT for the g-expansion. Growth is (2m)!/pi^{2m}, not m!/pi^m.
The physicist may have intended the ORIGINAL z=eB/m^2 expansion (z^{2n} terms)
where growth pattern is consistent but the right variable is g=z^2 giving n!.

**Claim: "[N/N] Pade of B(t) converges to t_* = pi"**
NOT VERIFIED. Borel-Pade poles are on the NEGATIVE real axis, not at t=+pi.

**Physical explanation:**
- For MAGNETIC field B: L_EH is real (no pair production); expansion in g=(eB/m^2)^2>0
- Schwinger rate is for ELECTRIC field E: Im L_EH ~ exp(-pi m^2/eE) -- essential singularity
- In B-plane: the singularity is at g < 0 (analytic continuation), giving t < 0 Borel poles
- The physicist's "t_* = pi" may refer to the critical field in different units

## Comparison: quartic anharmonic oscillator (Remark 2.8 reference case)
AO: a_n ~ (-3)^n * n! / sqrt(pi*n)  [clean n! growth]
    ratio a_{n+1}/a_n ~ -3n ✓ [verified numerically]
    Borel singularity at t = -1/3 [isolated pole -> Borel-Pade works cleanly]

EH: d_m ~ (-1)^m * (2m)!/pi^{2m} [super-factorial]
    Borel transform: ESSENTIAL SINGULARITY at t = 0- (not isolated pole)
    -> Needs Ecalle-Borel or Picard-Lefschetz thimble (not standard Borel-Pade)

## Verdict for Remark 2.8 / uncuttable paper
- AO: clean and correct Remark 2.8 example. Keep.
- EH: qualitatively correct (resurgence operative) but structure is HARDER.
  The simple "Borel-Pade recovers instanton" statement fails; needs lateral summation.
  Could be mentioned as: "in QFT (EH), the relevant resummation is lateral Borel-Ecalle."
- Neither contradicts the thesis; they illustrate two levels of resurgence complexity.

## Python (reproducibility)
```python
from sympy import bernoulli, factorial
# c_n = 4**n / factorial(2*n) * float(bernoulli(2*n))
# d_m = c_{m+2} * factorial(2*m+1)
# b_m = d_m / factorial(m)  # Borel coefficients
# [3/3] Pade of b: poles at -2.095, -0.653, -0.292 (all negative real)
# AO: a_{n+1}/a_n ~ -3n (verified for n=2..6)
```
