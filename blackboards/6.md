# Newton Polygonal Convergence: Theorem + Failure Mode
Date: 2026-02-14
Cycle: S285 (parent: D28)

## Context
Section 3 of the cornerstone paper uses a finite-step impulse (kick-drift) model.
`Heuristic H1.2` identifies this as the symplectic Euler method for a separable
Hamiltonian \(H(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p})=|\mathbf{p}|^2/(2m)+V(r)\).
The manuscript hedges: "whenever the limit exists in the standard differentiable sense."
Goal: state a modern explicit convergence theorem and one failure mode.

## 1. The Kick-Drift Map as Symplectic Euler

For a separable Hamiltonian \(H=T(\mathbf{p})+V(\mathbf{r})\), the symplectic Euler
(semi-implicit Euler) method with step size \(h\) is:

\[
\mathbf{p}_{n+1} = \mathbf{p}_n - h\,\nabla V(\mathbf{r}_n), \qquad
\mathbf{r}_{n+1} = \mathbf{r}_n + h\,\nabla T(\mathbf{p}_{n+1}).
\]

For \(T=|\mathbf{p}|^2/(2m)\), this becomes:
- **Kick:** \(\mathbf{p}_{n+1}=\mathbf{p}_n + h\,\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}_n)\),
  where \(\mathbf{F}=-\nabla V\).
- **Drift:** \(\mathbf{r}_{n+1}=\mathbf{r}_n + (h/m)\,\mathbf{p}_{n+1}\).

This is precisely Newton's polygonal construction: an impulse at the current
position (changing velocity but not position), followed by inertial straight-line
motion at the new velocity.

## 2. Convergence Theorem (Modern Statement)

**Theorem (Global O(h) convergence of symplectic Euler for Lipschitz systems).**
Let \(H(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p})=T(\mathbf{p})+V(\mathbf{r})\) be a separable
Hamiltonian on \(\mathbb{R}^{2d}\), with \(\nabla V\) and \(\nabla T\) both
globally Lipschitz continuous. Let \((\mathbf{r}(t),\mathbf{p}(t))\) be the exact
Hamiltonian flow for \(t\in[0,\tau]\), and let
\((\mathbf{r}_n,\mathbf{p}_n)_{n=0}^N\) (where \(Nh=\tau\)) be the symplectic
Euler iterates with initial data
\((\mathbf{r}_0,\mathbf{p}_0)=(\mathbf{r}(0),\mathbf{p}(0))\).

Then there exists a constant \(C>0\), depending only on the Lipschitz constants
of \(\nabla V\) and \(\nabla T\) and the time horizon \(\tau\), such that:

\[
\max_{0\le n\le N}
\bigl(|\mathbf{r}_n-\mathbf{r}(nh)|+|\mathbf{p}_n-\mathbf{p}(nh)|\bigr)
\le C\,h.
\]

**Proof sketch.** This is a special case of the standard convergence theorem
for one-step methods applied to ODEs (Hairer-Norsett-Wanner, *Solving ODEs I*,
Thm II.3.6; Hairer-Lubich-Wanner, *Geometric Numerical Integration*, Thm IX.3.1).
1. **Consistency:** the local truncation error is \(O(h^2)\) per step (first-order method).
2. **Stability:** the Lipschitz condition ensures nearby trajectories diverge at
   most exponentially in time.
3. **Convergence:** consistency + stability gives global error
   \(\tau \cdot e^{L\tau} \cdot O(h) = O(h)\).

**Hypotheses in central-force language:**
- \(\nabla V\) Lipschitz means the force field \(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})\) is
  Lipschitz on the spatial domain visited by the orbit.
- Finite time interval \([0,\tau]\).
- Orbit stays in a compact region away from singularities of \(V\).

## 3. What the Symplectic Structure Adds

Beyond bare convergence, the symplectic Euler map preserves
\(\omega=d\mathbf{p}\wedge d\mathbf{r}\) exactly at each step. For central forces:
- **Angular momentum:** each kick is radial (preserves \(\mathbf{L}\)), each drift
  is linear (also preserves \(\mathbf{L}\)). Exact at every finite step.
- **Equal-area law:** follows from angular momentum conservation. Exact at every step.
- **Energy near-conservation:** backward error analysis shows the numerical
  trajectory is exact for a modified Hamiltonian \(\tilde{H}=H+O(h)\), so
  energy oscillates with amplitude \(O(h)\) without secular drift over
  exponentially long times \(O(e^{c/h})\) (HLW06, Ch. IX).

## 4. Failure Mode: Collision Singularity (\(r\to 0\))

For an attractive central potential \(V(r)=-K/r^{n-1}\) (\(n\ge 2\)),
the force \(|\mathbf{F}|=K(n-1)/r^n\) diverges as \(r\to 0\).
The Lipschitz constant blows up:

\[
\|\nabla^2 V\| \sim K\,n(n-1)/r^{n+1} \to \infty \quad\text{as } r\to 0.
\]

**Convergence theorem hypotheses fail near collision.**

What goes wrong concretely:
1. Local truncation error blows up (involves \(\nabla^2 V\)).
2. Step size must shrink as \(h\sim r^{n+1}\to 0\) to maintain accuracy.
3. For \(n\ge 3\), the orbit can reach \(r=0\) in finite time (centrifugal barrier
   too weak). The numerical method breaks down completely.

**Concrete witness (Kepler radial collision).**
For \(V=-K/r\) with \(L=0\) (radial orbit): \(r(t)\propto (t_c-t)^{2/3}\),
force \(F=K/r^2\propto (t_c-t)^{-4/3}\to\infty\). Fixed-step symplectic Euler
accumulates O(1) error before \(t_c\) and produces spurious behavior
(overshoot or artificial bounce). Regularization (Kustaanheimo-Stiefel or
Levi-Civita) or adaptive stepping is needed.

## 5. Connection to Manuscript's Hedge

The manuscript's "whenever the limit exists in the standard differentiable sense"
(`Remark H1.1a`) is precisely the right scope boundary: the polygonal construction
converges to a smooth orbit wherever the force is Lipschitz (away from collision),
and fails exactly at the \(r=0\) singularity where central-force potentials cease
to be Lipschitz. The structural content (angular momentum, equal-area law) is
exact at each finite step regardless.
