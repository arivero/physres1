# Non-Perturbative Content of the Contact Expansion
Date: 2026-02-13
Cycle: S208 (Open question #4)

## The question
The contact expansion C₀ + C₂q² + C₄q⁴ + ... is perturbative in
q/M. Can its non-perturbative content (bound states, production
thresholds, instantons) be recovered from the Taylor coefficients?

## Concrete worked example: Padé recovery of Yukawa pole

### Setup
Yukawa exchange: A(q²) = g²/(q² + M²). This is the tree-level
mediator-exchange amplitude (fermionic paper Remark 4.6).

### Contact expansion (Taylor at q²=0)
  A(q²) = C₀ + C₂q² + C₄q⁴ + ...
where  C₀ = g²/M²,  C₂ = -g²/M⁴,  C₄ = g²/M⁶, ...

The Taylor series converges for |q²| < M² (disk of convergence).
The pole at q² = -M² (on the physical Riemann sheet) is invisible
in any finite truncation.

### Padé recovery
The [0/1] Padé approximant of C₀ + C₂q²:
  P[0/1](q²) = C₀/(1 - C₂q²/C₀) = (g²/M²)/(1 + q²/M²) = A(q²)

**Exact recovery from just TWO contact coefficients.**

SymPy verification confirms: P[0/1] = g²/(q²+M²) = A(q²). ✓

### Physical interpretation
- C₀ = g²/M² is the "scattering length" of the mediator exchange.
- C₂/C₀ = -1/M² encodes the mediator mass.
- The Padé pole at q² = -M² is the mediator propagator pole.
- Two low-energy observables (C₀, C₂) determine the UV mass scale M.

This is "non-perturbative" in the sense that the pole is beyond the
radius of convergence of the Taylor series. The Padé extrapolation
is the simplest instance of controlled extrapolation beyond the
perturbative regime (cf. uncuttable paper's counterterm tower theme).

## Loop-level extension: branch cuts and dispersion

### Setup
At one loop, the vacuum polarization Π(q²) (fermionic paper §3.1)
has a branch cut starting at q² = 4m² (pair production threshold).

### Contact expansion
Below threshold (q² < 4m²), the Taylor expansion converges:
  Π(q²)/q² = Σ aₙ (q²/4m²)ⁿ

The imaginary part Im Π(q²) for q² > 4m² is the production cross
section (optical theorem, Remark 3.6). This is invisible to any
finite number of Taylor coefficients.

### Recovery methods
1. **Dispersion relations** (fermionic paper Remark 3.5):
   Π(q²) = (q²/π) ∫_{4m²}^∞ ds Im Π(s)/(s(s-q²))
   The branch cut determines the full function. Conversely,
   the Taylor coefficients determine the moments of Im Π.

2. **Padé accumulation**: [N/N] Padé approximants of the Taylor
   series place poles that accumulate on the branch cut as N→∞.
   By Montessus de Ballore (for meromorphic approximation of
   functions with cuts), the convergence is logarithmic in N.

3. **Borel–Padé** (uncuttable paper Remark 2.8): if the Taylor
   coefficients grow factorially (aₙ ~ n!), the Borel transform
   B(t) = Σ (aₙ/n!)tⁿ has finite radius of convergence, and
   Borel–Padé resummation recovers the full function including
   the imaginary part from the Borel singularity.

### Key structural point
The contact expansion DETERMINES the non-perturbative content
(given analyticity and crossing, which are the RCP consistency
conditions in disguise). The reconstruction requires a controlled
extrapolation:
- Padé for poles (tree-level: exact from 2 coefficients)
- Dispersion for cuts (loop-level: moment problem)
- Borel–Padé for divergent series (non-perturbative: resurgence)

Each reconstruction method is an instance of the "refinement requires
control" thesis: the Taylor coefficients are the "local data" and the
reconstruction is the "refinement limit" that accesses global structure.

## Connection to other papers
- **Fermionic**: §4 (contact expansion), Remark 3.5 (dispersion),
  Remark 4.6 (universality) — the tree-level Padé example is the
  explicit content behind "C₀ doesn't determine the UV."
- **Uncuttable**: Remark 2.8 (Borel resummation), §2 counterterm
  tower — Padé/Borel is the next step beyond Taylor.
- **Cornerstone**: §8 (RG as refinement) — the contact-coupling beta
  function is the perturbative avatar of the full non-perturbative
  structure.

## Question 4 status
Partially addressed. The tree-level Padé recovery is a clean worked
example. The loop-level connection (dispersion, Borel–Padé) is
structural but lacks a new explicit calculation. Two concrete follow-
ups remain:
(a) Explicit Borel–Padé resummation of QED vacuum polarization Taylor
    coefficients, recovering Im Π above threshold.
(b) Connection to the Efimov effect (Remark 5.5): does Padé of the
    2-body contact expansion predict the 3-body limit cycle?

## Proposed update to motivations.md
Change question 4 status to: "S208 analysis: Padé [0/1] of the contact
expansion exactly recovers the Yukawa mediator pole from two Wilson
coefficients — a concrete 'non-perturbative from perturbative' example.
Loop-level extension (Borel–Padé recovery of pair-production threshold)
is structural but unworked."
