# B14 Execution: Add Nauenberg2003 + Pourciau2003 bibliography entries

Date: 2026-02-12

## Summary
Added two Newton-limit convergence references to `paper/bibliography.md`:
- `[Nauenberg2003KeplerArea]`: Nauenberg, "Kepler's Area Law in the Principia," Historia Mathematica 30 (2003). arXiv OA (math/0112048).
- `[Pourciau2003]`: Pourciau, "Newton's Argument for Proposition 1 of the Principia," Arch. Hist. Exact Sci. 57 (2003). Springer, PENDING (likely paywalled).

## Work log
1. Added entries #31 and #32 to the Sources section with full bibliographic data.
2. Added entries #32 and #33 to the DOI Audit section.
3. Added entries #31 and #32 to the OA Acquisition Status section.
4. Nauenberg2003 has arXiv OA but is not yet ingested into `sources/` (optional future task).
5. Pourciau2003 has no OA route identified; marked PENDING.

## Notes
- These citation keys were already referenced in `paper/main.md` (Remark R1.1, added in C103).
- Source ingestion for Nauenberg2003 (arXiv math/0112048) can be done in a future B cycle if the content needs detailed verification.
- Pourciau2003 is used as a "critical analysis" citation, not a load-bearing claim anchor, so PENDING status is acceptable.

## Spawned cycles
- None.
