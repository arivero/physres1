# S11 Debate

## Question
Do we want the “corner/jump” story primarily as:
1) an Euler–Lagrange weak-form derivation (distribution theory), or
2) a semiclassical “stationary phase around piecewise classical paths” story?

## Working Resolution
Stay in pure distribution/variational calculus for this cycle (one explicit weak-form computation).
The semiclassical extension can be a later study note if needed.
