## Failure Modes
1. Smuggling \(\mu\) dependence into “universal constants” unnoticed.
2. Confusing “analytic in \(g(\mu)\)” with “analytic in dimensionful \(G\)” without scale-setting.
3. Overstating the conclusion as a theorem rather than as hypothesis hygiene.

## Mitigations
- Keep the argument at the level of dimensional analysis + definition of perturbative expansions.
- Phrase outputs as conditional statements (“if one defines analyticity as …, then …”).
