# S133 Execution: Wigner function and sub-Planck structure

Date: 2026-02-13

## Summary
Wrote blackboard slot 2 with 4 claims about the Wigner function as the
fine-grained phase-space portrait complementing Husimi. Quantum foundations
specialist reviewer confirmed all claims except one quantitative error:
Laguerre polynomial argument should be 2H/ℏω, not 4H/ℏω. Fixed.

## Work log
1. Wrote blackboard 2.md: Wigner definition, Fock-state formula, Husimi as
   Gaussian-smoothed Wigner, structural lesson for action-angle.
2. Spawned quantum foundations specialist subagent for review.
3. Reviewer found Laguerre argument error (4H→2H). Fixed in blackboard.
4. Reviewer confirmed all other claims. Suggested clarifying "sub-Planck" to
   avoid confusion with Planck-scale (quantum gravity) physics.
5. Ready for promotion as Remark 6.6 in action-angle satellite.
