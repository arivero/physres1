# S01 Execution

## Work
- Wrote a blackboard note splitting the “H2.5” constraint into three distinct knobs:
  1. integrality/monomial sieve,
  2. perturbative analyticity around a distinguished limit,
  3. RG dimensional transmutation as a separate (non-analytic) scale-supplier.
- Recorded which “\(D=4\Rightarrow\) area” statements belong to which branch and why coupling-admissibility rules are required for H2.5 to be non-vacuous.

## Result
- `blackboards/2026-02-09-h2-5-split.md` now provides a branch map plus promotion candidates for the Planck-area draft (and for notational guardrails in the main paper).

## Status
Completed.
