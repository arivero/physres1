# S190 Debate: Anachronism vs. illumination in Zeno mapping

Date: 2026-02-13

## Question
Is formalizing Zeno's paradoxes as modern refinement limits genuinely illuminating, or does it commit historical anachronism by imposing 20th-century mathematics onto 5th-century BCE thought?

## Working answer
The paradoxes are genuinely proto-refinement arguments—they hinge on the logical impossibility of completing infinite chains of tasks in finite time. The modern formalization (series summation, limits) is anachronistic in *notation* but faithful to the logical structure. Hedging with "in modern terms" and "suggestively" maintains scholarly honesty.

## Next check
Verify that the remark reads as a *suggestive frame* (Zeno as historical inspiration) rather than a *historical claim* (Zeno *knew* refinement limits). This distinction is critical for avoiding anachronism charges.
