# C00 Debate

## Claim
The paper should be organized by refinement logic as the central unifier across Newtonian mechanics, variational mechanics, quantization, and renormalization.

## Objection
This can become too abstract and lose concrete physics unless each cycle adds derivations tied to specific equations.

## Resolution
Enforce hard gate requiring equations or full derivations per cycle and explicit section growth in `paper/main.md`.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Dirac distributions should be used to probe local stationarity/extrema in a variational weak formulation.

## Objection
Point-like variations can be mathematically invalid if products of singular distributions appear.

## Resolution
Require mollifier-based limits and explicit caveats on invalid products; downgrade overreaching claims to `Heuristic`.

## Status
Accepted with caveat.

## Claim
`C00` should already include explicit equations rather than leaving all mathematics to later cycles.

## Objection
Early equations may force notation choices too soon and constrain later derivations.

## Resolution
Fix only core invariant notation (`S[q]`, `S_N`, `\dot A`, `L_ang`) and leave model-specific dynamics to later cycles.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Historical motivation can be included in `C00` if source anchors are present.

## Objection
Historical claims can drift into unsourced narrative.

## Resolution
Keep historical statements narrow and attach citation keys in manuscript plus source ledger entries in `paper/bibliography.md`.

## Status
Accepted.
