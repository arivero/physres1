# S153 Execution: Schwinger pair production and Euler-Heisenberg

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 1 on Schwinger pair production and Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian.
2. Reviewer (strong-field QED theorist) found:
   - Rate prefactor dimensionally wrong (missing m² factors). Fixed with corrected form Γ/V ∝ m²(E/E_cr)² exp(-πE_cr/E).
   - Critical field E_cr = m²c³/(eℏ) ≈ 1.3×10¹⁸ V/m: CORRECT.
   - Euler-Heisenberg coefficients 2α²/45 and 7: CORRECT.
   - "exp(-const/α)" characterization imprecise. Fixed: stated as essential singularity exp(-πE_cr/E).
   - Dimension-8 operators: CORRECT.
3. Promoted as Remark 3.3 with corrected rate formula and non-perturbative characterization.
