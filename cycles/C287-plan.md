# C287 Plan: Promote threshold-unification clarification in relativistic satellite

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Promote the S269 derivation into the relativistic manuscript as a new compact remark that clarifies mechanism separation.

## Target manuscripts
- `paper/main.md` (no)
- `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add one new remark after `Remark 3.1b` with formula \(q_\mathrm{crit}=\nu+1\) and explicit caveat about dimensional identity.

Out of scope:
- Additional GR sections or bibliography overhauls.

## Acceptance criteria
- Substantive manuscript change with paragraph-level addition.
- Diffstat recorded in `cycles/C287-execution.md`.
- Guard check: no cycle IDs leaked into manuscript.
