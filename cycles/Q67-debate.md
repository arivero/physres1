# Q67 Debate: Is "not merely an analogy" too strong?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The closing sentence of D6.2a-sg claims the RG semigroup language in H6.2 "is not merely an analogy." Could a referee object that the toy ODE semigroup is too simple to justify this claim for the full QFT RG?

## Recommendation
The claim is correctly scoped. The remark says the step-refinement control maps *themselves* form a semigroup — it does not claim this exhausts QFT renormalization. H6.2 already contains the caveat that "this example is included not to replace QFT renormalization" (line 990). The closing sentence upgrades the analogy *within its stated scope* (toy ODE step-refinement), which is precisely what was derived. No change needed.
