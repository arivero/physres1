# D06 Plan: Log Submission-Hardening Wave + Queue Reader-Navigation Diagram/Table

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Update durable docs to reflect completion of the submission-hardening wave (`Q49 → C93 → Q50`), then pick the next concrete improvement that increases foundations-journal readability without expanding technical scope.

## Candidate next targets
1. **Reader navigation table/diagram**: implement the “consolidated diagram/figure summarizing the refinement-compatibility chain” (currently listed under Future Work) as an actual compact table in the manuscript.
2. **Dirac 1933 OA hardening**: time-capped additional attempt to find a lawful OA PDF (optional).

## Decision criteria
- Improves reader experience immediately.
- Minimal bibliography debt.
- Can be done derivation-first (no new claims).

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `cycles/D06-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- `S64`: draft the navigation table/diagram in a blackboard note with a copyable promotion block.
- `C94`: promote into `paper/main.md` (likely near the end of the Introduction or in Section 2.4).
- `Q51`: referee pass on `C94`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Durable docs updated.
- Next cycles specified (`S64 → C94 → Q51`).
