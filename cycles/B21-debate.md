# B21 Debate

## Decision
The satellite had zero inline citations, causing the build script to remove its entire References section. Six citations were added at natural points in the text — each supports a specific claim or framework invoked. All keys already existed in the master bibliography; no new entries were needed.

Considered but deferred: adding a Gelfand & Fomin (1963) calculus-of-variations reference for Theorem 3.1 (Weierstrass–Erdmann). This is standard enough that no citation is required for the note's purposes.
