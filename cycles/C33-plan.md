# C33 Plan

## Goal
Start a new dependent draft that unifies three “delta objects” under the half-density-first viewpoint, with at least one worked computation so it is not just an outline:
1. the identity kernel \(\delta(x-y)\),
2. the critical-set delta \(\delta(\nabla f)\) / \(\delta(f')\),
3. the point interaction kernel \(\delta(x)\delta(y)\).

## Scope
1. Add `papers/delta-objects/main.md` with:
   - a short abstract + purpose,
   - the half-density kernel formulation of the identity and point interaction,
   - the distributional identities for \(\delta(f')\) and \(\delta(\nabla f)\) (nondegenerate case),
   - a stationary-phase comparison showing the square-root determinant weights at the amplitude level.
2. Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Non-Goals
- No new bibliography ingestion (use already-ingested anchors only).
- No edits to `paper/main.md` in this cycle.

## Acceptance Tests
1. The new draft contains at least one explicit worked computation (not just statements).
2. The draft clearly labels assumptions (finite-dimensional, nondegenerate).
