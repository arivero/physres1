# C68 Plan: Promote "Newton Limit Paradox" Motivation

## Goal
Make the long-term motivation explicit in the cornerstone manuscript: naive refinement limits are not automatically rigorous, and quantum/renormalization supply limit-control mechanisms.

## Scope
- Add one compact paragraph in `paper/main.md` Introduction framing this as a Zeno-style refinement paradox.
- Keep the statement at structural level (no new technical claims requiring new sources).

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript edit is substantive and improves motivation clarity.
- No cycle tags leak into manuscript text.
- `cycles/C68-execution.md` logs manuscript diffstat.
