# Q19 Debate: Is the D1.5 Block Getting Too Layered?

## Question
Should the D1.5 sequence be split into a separate short section to reduce local complexity?

## Current Resolution
Not yet:
- current layering is still linear (witness -> caveat -> candidate -> limitation);
- each remark answers a concrete ambiguity from the previous one;
- defer section split until one more content wave confirms stable final shape.
