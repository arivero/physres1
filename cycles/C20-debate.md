# C20 Debate

## Question
Is the “engineering-dimension” beta function for boundary parameters enough, or do we need a genuinely nontrivial (loop-induced) running to make the point?

## Notes
- For point interactions in 1D, much of the “flow” is classical scaling of boundary data; that can still be a compatibility constraint.
- The 2D delta provides the complementary case where running is genuinely logarithmic and produces dimensional transmutation.

## Resolution
Use the engineering-dimension flow as a deliberately “classical” RG witness, explicitly labeled as such, and pair it with a concrete scattering computation (1D \(\delta\)) so the scale-dependence is operational (S-matrix endpoints).
