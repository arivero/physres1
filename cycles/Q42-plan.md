# Q42 Plan: Referee Pass on Section 8 (After \(\tau\) Rewrite)

## Goal
Referee-style review of `paper/main.md` Section 8 (Renormalization as Controlled Refinement), focusing on:
- clarity of the compare-at-fixed-ruler control-map statement (`Derivation D6.0`),
- claim hygiene (scheme dependence vs invariants),
- reader flow from cutoff language (\(\Lambda\)) to regulator-independent language (\(h\), \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\)).

## Checks
1. Read Section 8 end-to-end for internal consistency and jargon leaks.
2. Ensure \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\) is described as a *chosen* comparison rule (not unique/physical).
3. Ensure the step-halving witness (`Derivation D6.2a`) is correctly linked as an induced \(\tau_b\).

## Acceptance
- Either "no edits required", or make minimal clarity edits and spawn a focused content cycle if more work is needed.
