# Q11 Debate: Is H4.0b Placed Correctly?

## Hard Question
Does placing H4.0b immediately before the time-slicing derivation interrupt the narrative flow?

## Current Resolution
It is acceptable because it is explicitly labeled as a short heuristic sidebar and is placed right after the scalarization-gauge discussion it depends on. It should remain short; if it grows, it should move out to a dependent draft.
