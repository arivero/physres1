# Q68 Red Team: What a referee would attack in C113's edits

Date: 2026-02-12

## Likely referee objections

- **"The parenthetical in Section 9.1 is too specific for a summary list"**
  - Mitigation: the other items in the list (items 1–5) are also quite specific (e.g., "equal areas / angular momentum preservation"). The parenthetical adds a concrete witness without breaking the register. Acceptable.

- **"'Complementary geometric resolution' overpromises — D9.1a only handles quadratic symbols"**
  - Mitigation: the sentence explicitly says "kinetic operators," which correctly scopes to the quadratic case. The word "complementary" signals it's an addition to (not replacement of) the deformation approach. No overclaim.

- **"The cross-reference to 'Appendix §10.2' will break if sections are renumbered"**
  - Mitigation: the reference includes the block name (`Remark D9.1a`) as primary identifier, with section number as secondary. Redundancy protects against renumbering.
