# Q01 Red Team

## Failure Modes
1. Citation mismatch: references do not actually support the surrounding statement.
2. Dimension ambiguity: \(d\) (composition variable) and \(D\) (spacetime) still blur in sieve statements.
3. Over-polish: quality pass triggers unnecessary rewrites instead of small clarity improvements.

## Mitigations
- For each new citation, rewrite the surrounding sentence to what the source clearly supports.
- Add one “dimension bookkeeping” line where the sieve is used, rather than global symbol churn.
- Keep Q01 outputs as a task list; spawn new cycles for actual edits.
