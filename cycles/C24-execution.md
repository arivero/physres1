# C24 Execution

## Changes
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md`
   - Added a short branch-summary paragraph at the end of Section 3.2 to keep the “scale supplier” mechanisms separated.
   - Added `Derivation D1.8a` making the bookkeeping identity explicit: an \(x\)-independent running scalarization \(\sigma_\ast(\mu)\) is equivalent to a multiplicative \(Z(\mu)\) factor on scalar representatives.
   - Added `Heuristic H2.11a` as a guardrail separating geometric half-density weights from RG anomalous dimensions.

## Status
Completed.
