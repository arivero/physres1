# C39 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Changes
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md`
   - Reframed Example E4 as “admit a universal area parameter \(\alpha_\ast\)” (string \(\alpha'\) as an example), preserving the sieve conclusion \(d\equiv0\pmod4\) under integer powers.
   - Updated H2.12 to state the gravity-from-\(\alpha_\ast\) scaling relation generically (\(G_d\propto g^2(\alpha_\ast)^{(d-2)/2}\)) and then specialize to the string case as an example, keeping it explicitly heuristic.
