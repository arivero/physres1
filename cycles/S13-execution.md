# S13 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Work
1. Added `blackboards/2026-02-10-scale-sieve-gravity-vs-alpha-prime.md` deriving simple dimension-matching “sieves” for supplying the half-density scalarization scale \(\text{length}^{D/2}\) from admissible universal couplings.

## Result
- Gravity-only + integer-powers sieve forces \(D=4\) (area scale \(G_4\)).
- Allowing a universal string area scale \(\alpha'\) admits \(D\equiv 0\pmod 4\) via \((\alpha')^{D/4}\), changing what is being claimed.
