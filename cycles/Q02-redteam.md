## Failure Modes
1. Redundancy: near-diagonal scaling + identity-kernel scaling now overlap and may feel repetitive.
2. Hidden assumptions: “gravity-only” language might still implicitly exclude \(\Lambda_d\)/\(\alpha'\) without flagging it.
3. Category errors: “delta as half-density” could be misread as introducing a square-root distribution rather than a kernel statement.
4. RG note: the added convention map might invite readers to ask for the physical scattering normalization mapping.

## Mitigations
- Explicitly point out where D1.2a vs D1.2b are complementary (general scaling vs concrete identity-kernel witness).
- Ensure the gravity-only sieve is always presented as conditional on an admissible-couplings choice.
- Keep delta statements in operator/kernel language.
- Add a forward “optional” queue item if mapping to physical \(f(k)\) normalization becomes necessary.
