# C182 Debate: Spin coherent states Remark 6.7

Date: 2026-02-13

## Decisions
- Placed before Section 7, as the last remark in the Section 6 examples gallery.
- Reviewer recommended Section 6 over Section 7 — the remark is a core example, not an extension.
- Used |⟨J⟩| = jℏ (expectation magnitude) rather than √(j(j+1))ℏ (Casimir), per reviewer confirmation.
