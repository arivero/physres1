# DX10 Execution: Mid-session project assessment
Date: 2026-02-13

## Current state
- **Cornerstone**: 1451 lines (up from 1435 at session start). New: D5.1a (Moyal product), Dirac Probes cross-ref.
- **9 satellites**: total ~2365 lines.
  - Planck Area: 730 (strong)
  - RG Fundamental: 596 (strong)
  - Half-Density QFT: 209 (solid)
  - Relativistic Orbits: 206 (solid)
  - Dirac Probes: 193 (new this session, solid)
  - Delta Objects: 164 (solid)
  - Fermionic Mediators: 112 (adequate)
  - Action-Angle: 87 (thin)
  - Uncuttable Refinement: 68 (thinnest, conceptual)
- **Cross-reference network**: 5 refs to 4 satellites. Missing: Rel. Orbits, Delta Objects, Fermionic Mediators, Action-Angle, Uncuttable.
- **Anomalies**: none open.

## Assessment
1. **Thinnest satellite**: Uncuttable at 68 lines. It's conceptual/philosophical; a worked mathematical example would strengthen it.
2. **Action-Angle** at 87 lines could also use expansion but already has two witnesses (φ/Lz and HO).
3. **Cornerstone content gaps remaining**: Section 3 numerical example (low priority), Section 6 semigroup composition verification (medium — partially addressed by satellites), Section 8 QFT loop (hard, deprioritized).
4. **Cross-reference coverage**: 4/9 satellites cross-referenced. Could add cross-refs for delta objects (from Section 5.5 or 6.3) and action-angle (from Section 6.4 or the remark D4.2b).

## Recommended next actions
1. Expand uncuttable paper: add a worked "counterterm subtraction" example making the renormalization analogy explicit.
2. Add cross-reference to action-angle from D4.2b (which already mentions angular-momentum delocalization).
3. Broad Q pass on cornerstone after all recent changes.
