# C113 Debate: Combine two DX03 spawns or split?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
DX03 originally spawned C113 (Section 9.1 gap) and C114 (Section 9.3 gap). Should they be separate cycles?

## Decision
Combined into one C113. Both edits are small (one parenthetical + one sentence), target the same section of the manuscript (Section 9), and serve the same purpose (forward-signaling for recently added blocks). Splitting them would produce two micro-edit cycles, which the C-cycle template discourages.

## Rationale
The minimum promotion bar for a C cycle is "at least one paragraph-level addition/rewrite." Two targeted signaling edits in the same section meet this bar collectively but not individually.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- C114 number is now available for future use.
- Q68 covers both edits in a single referee pass.
