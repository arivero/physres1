# S61 Red Team: Matching Risks

Date: 2026-02-10

## Failure modes
- Mixing conventions (Born factors, sign conventions):
  - Mitigation: present the Fourier-transform identity as the invariant core; keep overall prefactors labeled “convention-dependent.”
- Overstating generality (“all short-range forces are delta functions”):
  - Mitigation: phrase as “at sufficiently low resolution, local operators appear as diagonal-support distributions”; keep long-range tails explicitly out of scope.
- Conflating point interactions with literal “particles bound at the same point”:
  - Mitigation: translate to the precise statement: the interaction kernel is diagonal-supported; bound states are \(L^2\) solutions with short-distance boundary data.
