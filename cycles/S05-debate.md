# S05 Debate

## Question
Do we literally need a “square root of delta” object, or is the right invariant statement simply that **kernels live naturally as half-densities**, so the identity operator’s kernel is a canonical distributional bi-half-density?

## Working Resolution
Avoid “\(\delta^{1/2}\)” language unless it is explicitly defined as the Schwartz kernel of the identity operator on half-densities. The safe statement is:
the identity kernel is canonical on half-densities, and its scalar representative depends on the scalarization choice \(\sigma_\ast\).
