# C26 Execution

## Changes
1. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`
   - Added Section 5.9 (“Convention Map”) fixing the \((2\pi)^{-d}\) measure conventions, quoting the 2D/3D cutoff asymptotics, and stating explicitly how finite subtraction shifts rescale \(\kappa_\ast\) (hence \(R\)) while leaving the beta function unchanged.
   - Refreshed Section 7’s forward queue to remove items completed by `B01`/`S04`.
2. `docs/research-log.md`
   - Added a dated entry recording the promotion.
3. `cycles/index.md`
   - Updated “Next Action” to reflect current cycle state.

## Status
Completed.
