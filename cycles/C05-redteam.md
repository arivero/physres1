## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. The deformation discussion is formal/asymptotic; existence and uniqueness of strict quantizations are not addressed for general phase spaces.
2. Ordering-equivalence is stated at the deformation-class level, not verified by an explicit model-to-model calculation.
3. Domain/operator subtleties for unbounded observables are outside this cycle scope.

## Evidence Needed
1. `C06` should include at least one concrete divergent quantity with regulator, subtraction, and renormalized observable.
2. Add one short worked example later where two discretizations yield distinct \(O(\hbar)\) terms but identical classical limit.
3. If strict operator statements are needed in final pass, specify domains and topology assumptions explicitly.

## Next Cycle Patches
1. In `C06`, define refinement divergence and renormalization map in a way parallel to earlier limit-control language.
2. Connect counterterms to consistency of composed refinements rather than ad hoc correction rhetoric.
3. Mark RG flow statements as proved/heuristic according to available derivations.

## Closed Items
1. `C04` ordering ambiguity is now connected to deformation-equivalence language.
2. Commutator-to-Poisson recovery is explicit and dimensionally checked.
3. Formal-versus-strict boundary is stated to prevent overclaim.
