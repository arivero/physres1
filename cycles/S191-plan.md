# S191 Plan: Constructive QFT blackboard for uncuttable paper Section 4

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study constructive QFT for uncuttable paper Section 4—do the refinement limits actually exist rigorously?

## Deliverable (keep bounded)
- Target: one blackboard entry (~1.5 pages) surveying rigorous constructions (φ⁴₂, φ⁴₃, Gross-Neveu, 2D YM) and open problems (φ⁴₄ triviality, YM mass gap).
- Output file:
  - `blackboards/constructive-qft-refinement-existence.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S191-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Self-contained survey of constructive results with correct attributions and scope statements.
- Reviewed by mathematical physicist persona; corrections applied.
- Ready for promotion into a capstone Remark 4.11.
