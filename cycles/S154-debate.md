# S154 Debate: Anomalies as refinement constraints

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Anomalies are topological constraints on refinement limits — universal coefficients that every regularization reproduces.
- The "uncuttable" connection: no single regulator sees the anomaly correctly, but the coefficient is RG-invariant.
- 't Hooft matching as the non-perturbative version of refinement compatibility.
