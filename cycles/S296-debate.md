# S296 Debate: Dimensional Obstruction to Discrete-Time Composition

Date: 2026-02-14

## Hard Question

**Is the dimensional obstruction truly categorical, or does it depend on how one defines "available constants" in hypothesis (D)?**

## Position A: Obstruction is categorical

The obstruction is purely linear-algebraic in the dimension space. Two constants (m, hbar) span at most a 2D subspace of the 3D MLT space. The constraint beta = -2*gamma is structural: it follows from the fact that hbar is the only constant carrying both L and T dimensions, and it ties them together as L^2 T^{-1}. No reparametrization or redefinition changes this.

The only way to reach [T] = M^0 L^0 T^1 from {m, hbar} is to add a third independent constant (like c), which by definition goes beyond the non-relativistic {m, hbar}-only framework.

## Position B: The obstruction might be circumventable

One might argue:
1. The Hamiltonian H has dimension [energy] = ML^2 T^{-2}, and eigenvalues E_n provide time scales hbar/E_n. But these are state-dependent, not universal kernel parameters.
2. A lattice formulation might not require epsilon to have dimension T -- perhaps it enters as a dimensionless ratio. But physical time steps are dimensional.
3. The theory might use composite quantities (like m*L^2/hbar where L is a spatial scale) to produce time. But this requires an independent spatial scale, which is itself an external input violating (D).

## Resolution

Position A is correct. The obstruction is categorical for universal, state-independent kernel parameters built from {m, hbar} alone. Position B's counterexamples all introduce either state-dependence (violating universality) or additional dimensional constants (violating (D)).

The key insight is that {m, hbar} are dimensionally degenerate in the MLT system: they cannot independently access all three base dimensions. This is not a deficiency of the analysis but a physical fact about the non-relativistic constant set.
