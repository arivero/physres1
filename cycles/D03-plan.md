# D03 Plan: Foundations-Journal Hardening via Explicit RCP “Compatibility Diagram”

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Choose one next novelty/polish target that directly improves “foundations journal” readiness of the main manuscript, without editing manuscripts in this cycle. Then spawn the minimum follow-up cycles needed to make the improvement concrete and promotable.

## Novelty candidates (shortlist)
1. **Make RCP explicit as a compatibility diagram**: give a compact commuting-diagram/closure formulation for partition/representation/scale changes, plus one concrete “toy family” example that makes the symbols \(\mathcal C,\mathcal Q,\mathcal R\) operational.
2. **Gauge-phase / string-tension branch clarity**: add one clean, citation-anchored paragraph in the half-density scale-supplier ladder distinguishing fundamental \(\alpha'\) from emergent \(\sigma^{-1}\) (transmutation branch).

## Decision criteria
- Highest reader-value per added line: improves what a referee will ask first (“what is the principle, precisely?”).
- Low bibliography debt: should be derivation/definition-first, with minimal new source load.
- Directly supports the repo’s novelty guardrail: “one computation per concept” and clear claim taxonomy.

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/D03-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- `S63`: one-page blackboard note defining an explicit “compatibility diagram” version of RCP + a copyable promotion block.
- `C90`: promote the block into `paper/main.md` (preferably in the RCP appendix, optionally with a short intro cross-reference) + rebuild PDF.
- `Q48`: referee pass on `C90`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Exactly one chosen target with a one-sentence claim + explicit scope disclaimer.
- `S63/C90/Q48` are fully specified (titles + deliverables).
