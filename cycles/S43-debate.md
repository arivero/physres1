# S43 Debate: Pick One "Obstruction" or Keep a Short List?

## Question
Should the main paper name one dominant obstruction (e.g. non-existence of path-space measures), or keep a short list of complementary failure modes?

## Current Resolution
Keep a short list (2-3 items). This avoids overstating any single technical point as "the reason for QM" and matches the paper's staged, multi-mechanism structure.
