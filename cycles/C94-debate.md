# C94 Debate: Should the compatibility reader map live only in the RCP appendix?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Given that Appendix 10.3 already states the three compatibilities (RCP) and bridges back to Sections 3–8, is an additional early “reader map” redundant?

## Decision
Add an early reader map (end of Section 2.5) as navigation, while keeping Appendix 10.3 as the formal summary.

## Rationale
Appendix 10.3 is late in the document and is framed as a foundational summary; many readers will want an orientation *before* entering Section 3. A 3-line boxed block is low-cost, avoids new claims, and makes the partition/representation/scale spine explicit at the moment the manuscript transitions from setup into the Newtonian refinement chain.
