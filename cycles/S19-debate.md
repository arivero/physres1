# S19 Debate: Does This Count as “Beyond the Conformal Ansatz”?

## Hard Question
If we generalize from \(g=e^{2\sigma}\delta\) to \(g=e^{2\sigma}\bar g\), are we really testing beyond the conformal ansatz?

## Current Resolution
It’s a meaningful step:
- It removes the “flat base” specialness and shows the \(D(4-D)/4\) coefficient is universal within the conformal class.
- It does not address general (non-conformal) metric variations, so it is not fully “beyond conformal” in the strongest sense.

So we should phrase the result as: “robust within conformal rescalings (any base metric), still a conformal restriction.”
