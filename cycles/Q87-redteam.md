## Failure modes

### 1. Too definitional for publication
- Risk: the paper defines a term and illustrates it with standard examples (Riemann integral, action principle). No new result.
- Mitigation: this is the hardest paper to promote to Tier 1. It may remain at Tier 3 longer than others. Consider whether it should be absorbed into the cornerstone paper instead of being a standalone.

### 2. Title may mislead
- Risk: "uncuttable" sounds like it's about indivisible particles. The paper carefully says it's NOT, but the title alone could confuse.
- Mitigation: the abstract clarifies immediately. Acceptable for a working note.
