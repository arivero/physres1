# Q147 — Debate

## Should "Gauge Accident" Be Replaced?

**Pro "coordinate artifact":**
- More precise GR terminology
- "Gauge" in GR typically refers to diffeomorphism freedom or local symmetries
- Avoids potential confusion with gauge theory

**Pro "gauge accident":**
- Widely understood in physics community (coordinate choice = gauge choice in this context)
- More colorful/memorable phrasing
- Used informally in GR literature to mean "coordinate-dependent coincidence"
- The word "accident" emphasizes the non-fundamental nature of the simplification

**Resolution:** Keep "gauge accident" as written. The meaning is clear in context (Schwarzschild coordinates), and the informal tone matches the "Remark" format. If this were a main theorem statement, stricter terminology would be required, but for a remark highlighting a conceptual point, the current phrasing is appropriate.

## Does the Remark Overlap with Existing Content?

Checked Remarks 4.3a-e:
- 4.3a: SR vs GR stability (curvature term in V_eff)
- 4.3b: Angular-momentum floor at ISCO
- 4.3c: Radius hierarchy (photon sphere, unstable band, stable orbits)
- 4.3d: Accretion efficiency
- 4.3e: Apsidal advance divergence

**No overlap.** Remark 4.3f is the only one discussing orbital frequency and period, making it a natural complement to the existing remarks.

## Is the √(1-3M/r₀) Factor Novel?

This factor appears elsewhere in GR (e.g., gravitational redshift, time dilation at fixed radius). However, its appearance in the **orbital period** specifically — contrasted with the exact coordinate Kepler law — is the new observation here. The remark correctly positions this as another manifestation of curvature effects that already produced ISCO (4.3a-b) and precession (4.3e, 3.2).

**Verdict:** The connection is novel within the manuscript's narrative arc.

## Conclusion

No substantive objections. Remark 4.3f passes review.
