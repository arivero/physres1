# Q37 Plan: Quality Pass on Introduction After Ordering-Witness Promotion

## Goal
Referee-style check that the new parenthetical ordering-witness in `Heuristic H0.2` keeps the Introduction readable and claim-hygienic.

## Checks
1. Re-read Introduction through the "Contributions" list.
2. Verify the ordering-witness parenthetical is short and not overclaimed.
3. Confirm guardrails:
   - `rg -n 'C[0-9]{2}' paper/main.md`

## Acceptance Tests
- No edits required, or spawn a focused `C` cycle to tighten wording.
