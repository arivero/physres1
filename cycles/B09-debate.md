# B09 Debate: What counts as an acceptable “primary” anchor for Grassmann sources?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
Is an openly available set of lecture notes sufficient as an anchor for the Grassmann-source statement, or do we require a journal/textbook source?

## Decision
Use an OA lecture-page anchor now (to keep the pipeline unblocked), and treat a journal/textbook anchor as optional future hardening if a referee demands it.

## Rationale
The Grassmann-source point is standard and definitional; an OA lecture note is an acceptable primary pointer for the formalism in a foundations-style dependent note.
