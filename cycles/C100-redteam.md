# C100 Red Team: notation unification + next-term remark

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Readers misread \(f'(y)f(y)\) as a product:
  - Mitigation: remove the product shorthand from displayed equations; use only \(f'(y)[f(y)]\).
- Added \(f''\) term increases notation burden:
  - Mitigation: state it as an optional one-line remark with explicit scope (“Euler step-doubling discrepancy”), and define \(f''(y)[v,w]\) in the same paragraph if needed.
- Promotion wave becomes a micro-edit:
  - Mitigation: touch both manuscripts and include the rooted-tree identification remark (not only symbol substitution).
