# S189 Debate: Hubbard-Stratonovich Transformation

## Key Issue: Trace-Log Not Just Determinant
**Claim**: Effective action requires trace-log, not bare determinant.
**Resolution**: Explicit formula added. Clarifies that saddle-point equations require functional derivatives of Tr log.

## Key Issue: Fierz Rearrangement Caveat
**Claim**: HS channel decomposition via Fierz rearrangement is basis-choice dependent; not unique.
**Resolution**: Highlighted caveat. Different Fierz bases yield different (but equivalent) effective actions.

## Key Issue: Large-N_f Control
**Claim**: Saddle-point approximation (1/N_f control) is non-trivial for fermion determinant.
**Resolution**: Explicitly stated large-N_f requirement. Avoids false 1-loop claims.

## Key Issue: RG Matching
**Claim**: Should HS action inherit RG properties directly or require re-matching?
**Decision**: Both perspectives valid. Noted that matching (not inheritance) is canonical. Kept discussion flexible.

## Outcome
All HIGH/MEDIUM issues resolved. Blackboard reflects many-body rigor.
