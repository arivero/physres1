# C47 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. Overformal: Lie derivative notation intimidates QFT readers.
2. Underexplained: readers don’t see why it’s relevant.
3. Confusion: Lie derivatives vs covariant derivatives.

## Mitigations
1. Present the Lie-derivative identity as “coordinate-free version of \(\partial_x\delta=-\partial_y\delta\)”.
2. Tie it directly to moving derivatives between kernel slots / integration by parts.
3. Add one sentence that covariant derivatives can be introduced later when a metric connection is specified.
