# S142 Debate: Wilson's RG

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Wilson's RG is the canonical framework for the "uncuttable" pattern at full QFT strength.
- Reviewer recommended staying at conceptual level (4-6 sentences), matching the paper's "small conceptual bridge" register.
- The universality-as-refinement-compatibility analogy is the weakest link but defensible at conceptual level.
- Physical QFT is a relevant deformation of the fixed point, not the fixed point itself — softened in promotion.
