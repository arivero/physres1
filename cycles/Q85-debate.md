# Q85 Debate

## Hard question
Is 95 lines / 4 references too short for Tier 1?

## Resolution
No. The paper answers exactly one question ("can fermions generate potentials in the bosonic-source sense?") with one derivation and one remark. The references anchor the key claims. It's a note, not a monograph. The other Tier 1 papers are similarly focused (delta-objects: 139 lines, half-density-qft: 210 lines).
