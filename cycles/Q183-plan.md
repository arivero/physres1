# Q183 Plan: Referee pass on C301 (Remark H1.2a convergence theorem + failure mode)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle
- `C301`

## Review scope
1. Mathematical correctness of the O(h) convergence claim under Lipschitz forces.
2. Correctness of the failure-mode identification (collision singularity breaks Lipschitz).
3. Notation consistency with the rest of Section 3 (H1.1a, H1.2, P1.1, D1.1, D1.2).
4. Claim hygiene: no overstatement beyond remark-level scope.
5. Missing or weak references.
6. Clarity for a graduate-student reader.

## Acceptance criteria
- PASS if the statement is mathematically correct at declared scope, notation is consistent, and no regressions are introduced.
- PASS WITH MINOR REVISIONS if there are small issues (wording, missing citation) that do not affect correctness.
- MAJOR REVISIONS REQUIRED if there is a mathematical error, a misleading claim, or a structural problem.
