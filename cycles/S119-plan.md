# S119 Plan
Date: 2026-02-13
## Goal
Study the connection between the EFT contact expansion (Section 4, Derivation 4.1) and the scattering-theory effective range expansion (ERE). Prepare a blackboard note for potential promotion as a Remark in the fermionic mediators satellite.
## Method
Write blackboard connecting A(q) = C₀ + C₂q² + ... to k cot δ₀ = -1/a + r₀k²/2 + ..., identifying C₀↔a, C₂↔r₀, and noting Examples 5.1/5.2 as the r₀=0 case. Delegate review to a subagent with skeptical nuclear physicist persona.
