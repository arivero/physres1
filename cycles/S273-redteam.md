## Failure modes
1. Overusing counterexamples and undermining a useful orientation statement.
2. Promoting stress-test details directly into the main paper without compression.

1. Keep the bridge statement, but add one compact scope sentence in any future C-cycle refinement.
2. Keep detailed stress tests in notes; promote only the distilled boundary sentence.
