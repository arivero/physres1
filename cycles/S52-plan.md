# S52 Plan: Re-scan `conv_patched.md` and Update Coverage Map

## Goal
Refresh `docs/conv-coverage-map.md` to reflect what is now covered by the paper set, and identify any remaining high-value conversation themes that still need:
1) a study goal (`S`), then
2) a bibliography goal (`B`), then
3) a promotion (`C`).

## Tasks
1. Update `docs/conv-coverage-map.md` "Current coverage" and "Gaps" sections (many are now outdated).
2. Update `blackboards/2026-02-10-unresolved-conv-themes-coverage-map.md` accordingly.
3. Record 2-4 remaining high-ROI next study goals (e.g. generic-\(q\) areal-speed derivation; control-map \(\tau\) formalization; gauge/string-tension branch).

## Acceptance Tests
- Coverage map reflects current repo state (new dependent drafts and new Introduction heuristics).
- Next goals are stated as cycle-ready items (S then B then C).
