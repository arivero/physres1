# D51 Discovery: Are RCP commuting diagrams theorems or axioms?

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent thread: D49 (P4.2 ↔ RCP axiom mapping)

## Novelty target
The RCP foundations paper (Section 2.2) presents commuting diagrams where
partition and representation transformations commute:
  "refine then change ordering" = "change ordering then refine"
Determine whether this commutativity follows from A1-A5 or requires a
sixth axiom (A6: cross-channel commutativity).

## Motivation
- D49/V3 claimed logical independence of channels (A3, A4 independent of A1+A2+A5)
- But the commuting diagram ASSUMES the channels can be composed in either order
- If commutativity requires an independent axiom, the RCP axiom count increases from 5 to 6
- If it's derivable, the framework is more economical than it appears

## Success criteria
1. For each pair of channels (partition×representation, partition×scale, representation×scale):
   determine whether commutativity is a theorem or an axiom
2. Identify the mechanism (why does commutativity hold in the path integral?)
3. If any pair requires an additional axiom, propose its minimal statement

## Blackboard slot
Append to blackboard 0 (D49+D50 analysis) as Section 8.
