# C302 Execution: Symmetry selects midpoint ordering

Date: 2026-02-14

## Work completed
1. Added `Remark D4.1c` to `paper/main.md` Section 6.3, immediately after `Derivation D4.1b`.
2. The remark clarifies that symmetry (not unitarity directly) selects α=1/2 for the H=qp discretization.
3. Explains the logical chain: unitarity → self-adjointness → symmetry → α=1/2.
4. Notes the domain-dependence of essential self-adjointness (ℝ₊ vs ℝ).

## Content promoted
From `notebooks/ordering-unitarity-dilation-generator.md` (S280 main result): symmetry defect formula i ħ (2α-1) ⟨u,v⟩.

## Discovery flag
No — this is a clarification promotion from D23/S280.
