# C39 Plan

## Goal
Implement the Q07 action item: reduce “herd risk” in `papers/planck-area/main.md` by reframing the \(\alpha'\) example as an admissibility knob:
1. treat \(\alpha'\) as a generic **universal area parameter** (\(\alpha_\ast\)) that may exist in some UV completion,
2. keep string theory as an example parenthetical, not as the driver of the argument,
3. keep the dimension-sieve conclusions unchanged.

## Scope
1. Micro-edit `papers/planck-area/main.md` Example E4 and Heuristic H2.12.
2. Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Non-Goals
- No new bibliography ingestion.
- No changes to the hypothesis ladder outside the local block.

## Acceptance Tests
1. Example E4 reads as “universal area coupling admitted” (string as example), not as “string theory says so”.
2. The sieve statement “\(\alpha_\ast\)-only + integer powers ⇒ \(d\equiv0\pmod4\)” remains unchanged.
