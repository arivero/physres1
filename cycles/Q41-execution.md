# Q41 Execution: Quality Pass on Scale-Supplier Branch (Example E4 / Remark E4a)

## Checks Run
- Reviewed `papers/planck-area/main.md` flow from `Example E4` through `Heuristic H2.13`.
- Verified `Remark E4a`:
  - gives an operational Wilson-loop definition of \(V(R)\),
  - states the area-law \(\Rightarrow\) string tension identification,
  - cites `[Greensite2003Confinement]`,
  - keeps the string-tension option explicitly in the transmutation branch unless \(\alpha_\ast\) is assumed fundamental.

## Findings
- No edits required in this quality pass.

## Next Spawn
- `S57`: decide whether there is enough multi-wave substance to open a dedicated `papers/string-tension-as-area-scale/main.md` draft, or keep the discussion as a bounded option inside `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
