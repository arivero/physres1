# S57 Debate: Is Dimensional Matching Enough for a New Paper?

## Question
Is "string tension has units of area inverse in \(D=4\)" sufficient to warrant a new paper?

## Current Resolution
No. Dimensional matching is a useful option in the hypothesis ladder, but a new paper should add at least one technical contribution (a derived mapping, an invariance statement, or a worked example) beyond units and definitions.
