# C70 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overpromising inevitability:** list reads as "proof QM is forced."
2. **Redundancy:** repeats later material without adding value.
3. **Unanchored jargon:** "ordering/discretization" feels unexplained to new readers.

## Mitigations
1. Keep explicit heuristic framing and "in practice" language.
2. Keep list short and forward-refer to later sections implicitly by wording.
3. Use plain-language descriptors alongside technical keywords.
