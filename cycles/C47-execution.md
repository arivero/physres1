# C47 Execution: Contact-Term Algebra Clarified in Half-Density QFT Draft

## Work Completed
- Updated `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` Section 5 to include:
  - the coordinate-free Lie-derivative identity for the diagonal delta kernel,
  - a short point-splitting \(\to \delta'\) reminder,
  - pointers to the supporting blackboard notes (S18, S15).

## Result
The draft’s counterterm discussion now has a precise, measure-free kernel statement: local differential counterterms correspond to diagonal distributions built from the canonical bi-half-density delta kernel and its Lie derivatives.
