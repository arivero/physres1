# C208 Red Team: AB remark promotion failure modes

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes
- Sign error in phase formula from charge convention mismatch:
  - Mitigation: explicitly state e>0 in the remark; cross-check against Section 1 notation.
- Remark duplicates material already in Section 5:
  - Mitigation: read existing Section 5 carefully before inserting; ensure Remark 5.4 adds new content (gauge potential → action shift).
