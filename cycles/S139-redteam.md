# S139 Red Team: Real spherical harmonics

## Risks
- Phase convention error caught by reviewer — mitigated by avoiding explicit formulas in promoted remark.
- Var(Lz) = m²ℏ² is straightforward to verify: ⟨Lz⟩ = 0, ⟨Lz²⟩ = m²ℏ² for equal-weight ±m superposition.
- Chemistry connection is well-known but the uncertainty interpretation adds value.
