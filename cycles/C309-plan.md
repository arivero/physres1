# C309 Plan: Refinement Obstruction Theorem (Crown Jewel)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Formalize and promote the foundational theorem: composition-compatible refinement FORCES ℏ as necessary structural constant.

## Target manuscripts (must edit ≥1)
- `paper/main.md` (yes)
- `papers/<name>/main.md` (no)

## Scope
In scope:
- Formalize obstruction in naive Δt→0 without scale
- Prove κ with [κ]=[action] is necessary (not just convenient)
- Show κ→0 and κ→∞ limits both fail
- Connect to RCP as constructive principle

Out of scope:
- Full curved-manifold extension (noted as scope boundary)
- Numerical value of ℏ (experimental input)
- Uniqueness beyond exponential-weight form (requires dropping hypothesis L)

## Minimum promotion bar (preferably verbose)
This cycle should contain at least one paragraph-level addition/rewrite, a derivation/remark block, or a subsection-level change (avoid micro-edits as standalone `C` cycles).

## Allowed files
- `paper/main.md`
- `papers/*/main.md`
- `cycles/Cxx-*.md`
- (If tracked) `paper/main.tex`, `paper/main.pdf`, `papers/*/main.tex`, `papers/*/main.pdf`

## Forbidden files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`
- `docs/` (log work in `cycles/Cxx-execution.md` instead)

## Acceptance criteria
- At least one manuscript changed (substantively).
- Diffstat recorded in `cycles/Cxx-execution.md`.
- Guard check passes: no cycle IDs in manuscripts.
