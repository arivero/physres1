# S42 Plan: QFT Doubling Bridge in Half-Density Kernel Language

## Goal
Derive a clean kernel-level statement explaining why \(|\mathcal A|^2\) and real expectation values involve doubling (bra/ket), and why half-density kernels make the doubled composition canonical.

## Scope
1. Write density operators as bi-half-density kernels.
2. Derive \(K_{\rho_t}(x,y)=\iint K_t(x,x')K_{\rho_0}(x',y')\overline{K_t(y,y')}\).
3. Extract one concise promotion paragraph for `papers/half-density-qft/main.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- Blackboard note with explicit formulas and interpretation.
- Promotion target is short and does not require new bibliography.
