## Verification checklist

1. **SL(2,ℤ) mentioned** — Remark 4.8 presents the full
   $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality group with both $S$ and $T$
   generators, not just $g \leftrightarrow 1/g$.
   ✓ Verified.

2. **N=4 "conjectured to be exact"** — The remark says S-duality in
   $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM "is conjectured to be exact," not "is exact."
   ✓ Verified.

3. **KW self-dual coincidence noted as special** — The critical
   temperature self-duality is presented as a distinctive feature of
   the Ising model, not claimed as generic for all dualities.
   ✓ Verified.

4. **No UV/IR = asymptotic safety claim** — No trace of the dropped
   paragraph remains in the promoted text.
   ✓ Verified.
