# S70 Red Team: D=4 RG echo study failure modes

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes
- Overlooked RG dimension-selection mechanisms:
  - Mitigation: The analysis covers power counting, conformal invariance, and the trace anomaly. Asymptotic safety (gravity at D=4) was not analyzed; it could provide an additional echo but is speculative and beyond current manuscript scope.
- Conflation of "D=4 is special" with "D=4 is selected":
  - Mitigation: The blackboard note explicitly distinguishes "special" (some property holds) from "selected" (a principle singles it out). The half-density filter is a genuine selection (unique nontrivial root of D(4-D)/4); the RG echo is a consistency check, not a selection.
- Promotion risk -- remark could overstate the connection:
  - Mitigation: The promotion candidate explicitly says "logically independent" and "nontrivial structural check" rather than claiming a derivation of one filter from the other.
- Missing the deeper question:
  - Mitigation: The form-degree observation (2(p+1)=4 for p=1) is flagged as an open question for future DX cycles rather than prematurely resolved.
