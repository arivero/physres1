# C185 Debate: Dim reg Remark 4.2

Date: 2026-02-13

## Decisions
- Placed in Section 4 after Remark 4.1 (Wilson RG) — complements the blocking-transformation picture with the perturbative scheme.
- Used "naive momentum cutoff" (not "lattice cutoff") for gauge invariance breaking — Wilson's lattice preserves lattice gauge symmetry.
- Cross-referenced Example 3.1 (α-ordering) and Remark 3.4 (symplectic integrators) for structural parallels.
