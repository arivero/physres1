# S138 Execution: Asymptotic expansions and optimal truncation

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work Done
- Wrote blackboard slot 1: Poincaré asymptotic expansions, optimal truncation, superasymptotics, connection to Borel resummation.
- Asymptotic analysis specialist reviewed: all CORRECT except minor convention mismatch (x → 0+ vs x → ∞ in Poincaré definition — fixed in promoted remark by avoiding explicit variable convention).
