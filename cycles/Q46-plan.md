# Q46 Plan: Referee Pass on `C88` (Action–Angle Remark in Main Paper)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C88`

## Goal
Referee-pass the new `Remark D4.2b` insertion for:
- scope discipline (no angle-operator detour),
- correctness of the separation-of-variables witness,
- reader-flow fit near the stationary-phase discussion.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q46-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `docs/`
