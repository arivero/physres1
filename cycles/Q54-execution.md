# Q54 Execution: Referee pass on C97 standalone support for half-density QFT note

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C97`

## Findings
- The new `Derivation D1.1a` successfully removes the last companion-note dependency while staying within scope (no new citations, clean approximate-identity witness for the \(\varepsilon^{-D/2}\) exponent).
- The conformal expansion block is clearer with the explicit scalar-Laplacian formula displayed; the added scope disclaimer appropriately prevents over-interpretation of the \(D=4\) cancellation.
- Reader flow remains intact: the additions are short and feel like optional support rather than a detour.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- None required.

## Optional follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- `C98` (optional): add one sentence in Section 2 clarifying that the Gaussian witness is purely local/Euclidean (a coordinate patch argument) and that on curved \(M\) it should be read as a local normal-coordinate intuition.
- `B12` (optional, time-capped): if this note is aimed at external submission, consider adding a standard anchor for kernels on half-densities / intrinsic Schwartz kernels (but do not guess; treat as a dedicated bibliography task).

## Notes (non-actions)
- The note remains careful about signature (“Lorentzian/Euclidean” is mentioned early); if a future revision leans on the conformal computation, it may be worth stating explicitly that the worked expansion is Euclidean and serves as an algebraic identity in coordinates.
