# S277 Debate: Is window-validity too technical for the main paper?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Current question
Can a window-validity caveat be stated without adding technical clutter?

## Current stance
Yes. A one-sentence window caveat is possible; detailed tolerance values stay in notes.

## Iteration 2 addendum
With an exact formula available, the window-validity caveat is less "technical clutter" and more a compact precision statement.

## Iteration 3 addendum
The decade-drift gate keeps prose compact while making "mixed regime" warnings operational and testable.

## Iteration 4 addendum
Generalizing from decade-only drift to `b`-scale drift improves transferability without adding manuscript clutter; keep full formulas in S artifacts and promote only compact caveat language when needed.
