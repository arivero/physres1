## Failure modes
1. Readers misread the criterion as global dynamics rather than small-\(r\) asymptotics.
2. The threshold bridge is interpreted as proving the full relativistic bound-orbit classification.

## Mitigations
1. Include the phrase "fixed-\(L\), small-\(r\) asymptotic comparison" in promoted text.
2. Keep statement as a companion-note bridge, not a replacement for satellite derivations.
