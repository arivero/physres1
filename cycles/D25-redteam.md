# D25 Red Team: Stochastic-Impulse Bridge

Date: 2026-02-14

## Failure modes
- Choosing an additive-noise model where Itô vs Stratonovich makes no difference, producing a non-result.
- Smuggling editorial/prose goals into a physics study cycle.
- Overgeneralizing from one toy model to “path integrals are stochastic”.

## Mitigations
- Use multiplicative noise for the witness so the correction is nonzero.
- Keep deliverable strictly computational (one worked example + mapping).
- Promote only a scoped claim (one-sentence, model-dependent) unless broader theorems are proved.
