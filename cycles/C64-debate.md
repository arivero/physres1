# C64 Debate: Is “Few-Percent” Too Heuristic?

## Question
Should the nonlinear-trigger threshold be numerical (“few-percent”) or purely qualitative?

## Current Resolution
Keep a soft numerical guideline:
- it is actionable for iterative workflow,
- wording remains heuristic and can be tuned by dataset quality.
