# S72 Debate: Is the conformal-class restriction a weakness of PA-H2.6a?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The D=4 cancellation in the half-density conjugation is conformal-class-specific. Does this undermine PA-H2.6a as a "D=4 filter"?

## Working answer
No. PA-H2.6a explicitly says it is an "independent D=4 filter" that "does not supply a length scale" and is "recorded only as an additional special-dimension candidate knob." The conformal restriction is natural because: (1) scalarization gauge changes (replacing one reference half-density by another) are multiplicative rescalings, which in the metric-derived family correspond to conformal changes of the reference metric; (2) the question "does the kinetic operator simplify under scalarization-gauge changes?" is precisely the conformal-class question.

The conformal-class restriction is a feature, not a bug: it says the "operator simplicity" filter is probing the right geometric structure.

## Next check
A future S cycle could check whether the D=4 cancellation has a Weyl-tensor interpretation (the Weyl tensor is conformally invariant, and its coupling to half-densities might produce a complementary constraint). Low priority.
