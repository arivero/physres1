## Failure modes
1. The blackboard exploration contained a false start (delta-function route) and a sign error. The subagent correctly identified these as scratchwork residue and advised against promoting them. The candidate text was rewritten from scratch.
2. Three different personas used in three consecutive S cycles: skeptical mathematician (S103), rigorous pure mathematician (S105), pedagogical expositor (S106). The persona diversity is working — each caught different types of issues.
