# S88 Plan: Self-assessment consistency check (9.4/9.5/10.4 vs 10.5)
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Check whether the vulnerability/future-work self-assessment in Sections 9.4, 9.5, and 10.4 is consistent with the actual appendix content, particularly Section 10.5 (2D delta computation added after the original self-assessment was written).
