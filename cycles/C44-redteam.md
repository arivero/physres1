# C44 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim:** the calculus micro-model is presented as “explaining” QFT renormalization rather than illustrating its limit/subtraction skeleton.
2. **Notation drift:** introducing \(z_0\) or \(\delta'\) breaks the draft’s existing narrative flow.
3. **Conflation risk:** readers confuse \(\delta'\) with \(\delta(f')\) once both appear nearby in the repo.

## Mitigations
1. Add explicit “toy model” / “structural analogue” wording in the RG draft.
2. Keep additions minimal: one extra displayed line + a short paragraph; link out to the blackboard note for details.
3. In the delta-objects note, keep the existing \(\delta(f')\) vs \(\delta'\) distinction and add an explicit point-splitting formula with the sign fixed by pairing.
