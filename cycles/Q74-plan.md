# Q74 Plan: Referee pass on C118 (rg-fundamental standalone cleanup)

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C118`: removed 6 internal repo references from `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`

## Goal
Verify that the standalone cleanup preserved technical correctness, didn't introduce new issues, and that no internal references remain.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q74-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts, blackboards/notes, bibliography ledger, sources

## Checklist
- All 6 edits preserve the original technical claim.
- No internal repo references remain (paper/main.md, blackboards/, papers/).
- No "main manuscript" or "companion" language.
- Notation consistent with the rest of the paper.
- "Supplementary material" reference (line 112) is acceptable or needs revision.
- Abstract unchanged and still accurate for standalone reading.

## Acceptance criteria
- A concrete list of edits to do next, expressed as spawned cycles, or "clean pass."
