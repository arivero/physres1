# C290 Debate: How far to push domain analysis in the main paper?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Should the manuscript attempt full self-adjoint extension analysis here, or keep a scoped symmetry-domain witness and defer full classification?

## Options
1. Full extension analysis now.
2. Scoped witness now, explicit deferment of full extension theory.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
The current boundary is about demonstrating that ordering choices affect operator-level properties on a concrete domain; full extension classification is larger than this cycle and would bloat the appendix.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- If needed later: spawn an `S` cycle for full extension analysis and then a larger `C` promotion.
