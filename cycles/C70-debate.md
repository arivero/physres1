# C70 Debate: Short List vs Deep Dive in the Introduction

## Question
Should the introduction include a deep technical explanation of the obstruction, or just a short enumerated list?

## Current Resolution
Keep it as a short heuristic list. Details belong in later derivations (weak form, ordering/discretization discussion, renormalization section).
