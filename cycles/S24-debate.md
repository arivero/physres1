# S24 Debate: Force Law vs Potential in SR

## Question
Should we start from a potential \(V(r)\) via the relativistic Lagrangian, or from a prescribed force law \(F(r)=K/r^q\)?

## Resolution
Start from the force law for this cycle (minimal kinematics + \(dp/dt\) identities), since the transcript thread is framed that way and the circular-orbit constraint is the main deliverable. If we later promote to a paper, we can add the Lagrangian/Hamiltonian effective-potential framing as a second wave.
