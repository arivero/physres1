# S295 Debate: Does dimensional analysis truly exclude all non-Gaussian Levy measures?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
The dimensional obstruction proves alpha != 2 is excluded when the only available constants are {m, hbar}. But what if an additional physical constant (e.g., a length scale from a lattice, a cutoff, or a coupling constant) is available? Could alpha != 2 survive?

## Working answer
If a third dimensionful constant is introduced (e.g., lattice spacing a with [a] = L), the system of equations gains a third unknown and the obstruction dissolves. For example, with {m, hbar, a}: [c] = [m]^x [hbar]^y [a]^z has 3 unknowns for 3 equations (M, L, T), generally solvable for any alpha.

However, hypothesis (D) of P4.2 specifically restricts the kernel to depend on the "natural" constants of the particle ({m, hbar}) and the classical action. Introducing a lattice spacing or cutoff violates the hypothesis that the theory is formulated on a continuum with standard physical constants. The obstruction is valid within the P4.2 framework.

The deeper point: a Levy kernel with alpha != 2 requires a dimensionful constant that is neither mass nor action. This constant must come from somewhere outside standard single-particle quantum mechanics -- it signals a fundamentally different physical theory (e.g., lattice, fractional quantum mechanics with a new fundamental scale).

## Next check
Examine whether "fractional quantum mechanics" literature (Laskin 2000, 2002) introduces such a constant, and whether it has physical interpretation within P4.2's framework.
