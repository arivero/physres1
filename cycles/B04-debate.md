# B04 Debate: Which RG Reference Fits Our “Compatibility” Framing?

## Candidate Types
1. Classic Wilson–Kogut review (often not OA).
2. Modern arXiv/Phys. Repts. ERG review (OA via arXiv).

## Resolution
Prefer a modern OA review that explicitly discusses coarse-graining flows, fixed points, and semigroup character; keep it as an anchor, not a narrative driver.
