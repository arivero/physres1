# Q42 Debate: How Much Scheme Dependence Belongs in the Main Text?

## Question
Should `Derivation D6.0` explicitly mention scheme dependence/invariants, or keep this implicit to avoid clutter?

## Current Resolution
Keep `Derivation D6.0` minimally explicit: \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\) is chosen, \(\tau_b\) is induced; invariants can be deferred to `Proposition P6.3` and Section 9.
If reviewers complain, add one sentence about fixed points/exponents later.
