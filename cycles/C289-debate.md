# C289 Debate: Keep package queue as planning text or start proving through it now?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Given user feedback that the prior wave was too small, should the package queue remain mostly planning prose until separate cycles, or should this cycle convert multiple packages into immediate derivation content?

## Options
1. Keep package queue mostly intact and defer technical details.
2. Promote multi-package starter derivations now, even if each is compact.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
The bottleneck is momentum, not topic selection. Promoting compact but explicit witnesses now reduces stability drift and keeps subsequent cycles focused on deepening already-written derivations.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Follow-up `Q` cycle should test mathematical and notation consistency of new appendix additions.
