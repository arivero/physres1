# C74 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Wrong statement**: measure-theory claim is misstated (missing hypotheses like sigma-finiteness / finiteness on an open set).
2. **Pedantry trap**: the manuscript gets dragged into measure-theory details that distract from the refinement narrative.
3. **Overreach**: readers misread the statement as "classical mechanics is inconsistent."

## Mitigations
1. Keep the manuscript statement at the minimal "no translation-invariant Borel measure finite on a neighborhood" level.
2. Put proof sketches only in blackboards; keep the manuscript at 2-3 sentences.
3. Explicitly phrase the point as conditional on the refinement-by-integration program.
