# S68 Plan: Euler step-doubling discrepancy through \(O(h^3)\)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Extend the explicit Euler “two half-steps vs one step” discrepancy by one term (through cubic order) and express the result in unambiguous elementary-differential / rooted-tree notation.

## Deliverable (keep bounded)
- Target: one short derivation (Taylor expansion to second order) + one symbolic sanity check (scalar toy model).
- Output file(s):
  - `blackboards/2026-02-11-euler-step-doubling-order-h3-rooted-tree.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S68-*.md`
- `cycles/index.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- A self-contained derivation/check with clear hypotheses and explicit notation \(f'(y)[v]\), \(f''(y)[v,w]\).
- Promotion-ready block prepared for `C100` (no manuscript edits here).
