# S71 Debate: Is the 11-prediction enumeration complete?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Have we captured all the structural predictions that RCP makes in the manuscript, or are important ones missing?

## Working answer
The enumeration covers every explicit "closure forces X" or "compatibility requires Y" derivation in Sections 3–8 and 10.3–10.5. Two plausible gaps:

1. **Half-density D=4 filter (H4.0a–c).** These are structural consequences of the half-density formulation, but they are not directly RCP predictions — they arise from the specific conjugation formula D(4-D)/4, which is upstream of the RCP framework. They constrain the kinematic arena, while RCP constrains dynamics within that arena. Including them as RCP predictions would overstate RCP's scope.

2. **Path-integral measure.** The formal "measure on paths" is treated heuristically (H0.2a). A rigorous RCP prediction might be: the path-integral measure is determined (up to equivalence) by requiring partition and representation compatibility simultaneously. This is implicit but never stated as a derivation. It could become a future prediction if formalized.

## Conclusion
The 11 predictions are the complete set extractable from the current manuscript text. The half-density D=4 results and the path-integral measure question are related but upstream/downstream of RCP proper. No revision needed.

## Subsidiary question: Should the weak predictions be dropped from the count?
No — they contribute to the overall picture that RCP is not a single-claim principle but a network of constraints. The falsifiability argument rests on the strong predictions; the weak ones show breadth.
