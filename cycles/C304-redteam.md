# Cxx Red Team: <failure modes for this promotion wave>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Failure modes
- Overclaiming / scope creep:
  - Mitigation: <wording guardrail>
- Missing derivation / fragile step:
  - Mitigation: spawn `Sxx` and downgrade claim to heuristic until verified.
- Weak anchoring (load-bearing claim without independent support):
  - Mitigation: spawn `Bxx` and thread citations in next `C`.
- Reader confusion (notation, dimension, conventions):
  - Mitigation: add a short conventions paragraph or table.
