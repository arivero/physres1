## Failure mode 1: Overstating novelty
The fact a₁ = (1/6 − ξ)R and ξ_conf = 1/6 at D=4 is textbook material.

**Mitigation**: The remark explicitly connects to Vassilevich 2003 and
frames the contribution as making the half-density origin of 1/6 explicit,
not as discovering a new mathematical fact.

## Failure mode 2: HD-D1.3a inconsistency
If a reader sees HD-D1.3a's old caveat ("conformal-class-specific") and
then HD-D1.3b's "universal coefficient," they might see a contradiction.

**Mitigation**: HD-D1.3a was updated with a transitional sentence
clarifying that the *detailed pattern* is conformal-class-specific but
the *leading-order coefficient* is universal. The two remarks are now
logically sequential.

## Failure mode 3: Page creep
HD-QFT was 227 lines → 233 lines. Still ~4pp compiled, well within
the 6pp PLB limit.

**Mitigation**: No action needed. The paper has room for ~2 more
substantive remarks before approaching the limit.
