# C03 Debate

## Claim
The Euler-Lagrange equations should be stated in weak/distributional form before any use of Dirac-supported probes.

## Objection
This risks becoming a pure math digression disconnected from physics.

## Resolution
Tie every weak/distributional statement to one physical use case: impulses, corners, or refinement limits.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Point-supported “probing variations” should be done by mollifier limits, not by inserting raw Dirac deltas into products.

## Objection
Mollifier limits can hide dependence on regularization choice.

## Resolution
State exactly what is invariant under mollifier choice (distributional convergence) and what is not (nonlinear products).

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Impulse forces should be treated as distributional forcing terms and yield momentum jumps.

## Objection
Jump conditions depend on whether the delta is in the Lagrangian, the equations of motion, or boundary terms.

## Resolution
Pick one clean model (delta forcing in equations) and derive the jump by integrating across the impulse; mention alternative corner conditions separately.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Corners without delta forcing should satisfy a no-jump condition in canonical momentum and be derived explicitly.

## Objection
This may duplicate standard calculus-of-variations material.

## Resolution
Keep a compact local derivation in section 5 so the singular taxonomy is complete before `C04`.

## Status
Accepted.
