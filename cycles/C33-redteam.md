## Failure Modes
1. Becoming a grab-bag of already-written content with no new synthesis.
2. Overclaiming the functional-integral analogue \(\delta(\delta S)=0\) as a theorem.
3. Losing the half-density priority thread by slipping into measure-dependent scalar formulas.

## Mitigations
- Keep the synthesis crisp: “amplitude half-density ↔ square root of delta-supported density”.
- Keep the functional-integral extension explicitly heuristic.
- Prefer operator/kernel language and keep scalarization clearly marked as a choice.
