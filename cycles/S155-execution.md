# S155 Execution: Gutzwiller trace formula

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 1 on the Gutzwiller trace formula: semiclassical spectral identity, periodic orbits as non-integrable generalization of EBK, spectral statistics bridge, Selberg trace formula.
2. Reviewed by semiclassical methods expert: all claims correct. Minor suggestions on clarifying transverse determinant and primitive vs. repeated orbits.
3. No corrections needed for promotion.
