## Content
Promoted Example 5.2 (3D contact interaction: scattering length) into fermionic mediators satellite Section 5, after Example 5.1 (2D delta potential).

## Diffstat
Satellite: fermionic-mediators-contact-limits/main.md
+7 lines (122 → 129).

## Result
Satellite now has both d=2 and d=3 contact interaction examples, completing the dimensional comparison.
