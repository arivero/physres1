## Failure modes
1. The numerical example could appear trivial to specialists (the area law is well known). Mitigation: the point is pedagogical concreteness, not novelty.
2. Floating-point discrepancy could confuse readers who try to reproduce. Mitigation: candidate text uses "algebraic sense" phrasing, not raw numerical claim.
3. Subagent review with "skeptical mathematician" persona was well-matched for numerical correctness. Future blackboards on physical topics should use a physicist persona.
