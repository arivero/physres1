# C245 — Execution

## Changes
Added Remark 3.2 (~15 lines) to the relativistic orbits paper:
- SR Binet equation with ω² = 1 − K²/(c²L²)
- Precessing ellipse solution
- ω = 1/γ_circ connection (links precession to Lorentz factor)
- Weak-field precession formula Δφ ≈ πK²/(c²L²)
- Gravitational case: SR precession = (1/6) × GR precession
- Physical interpretation: the 5/6 remainder comes from −2ML²/r³
  in Schwarzschild effective potential

Reviewer-suggested improvements incorporated:
1. Cited BoscagginDambrosioFeltrin2020 for derivation
2. Explained semi-latus rectum as property of precessing conic
3. Referenced Section 4.3 for GR precession
4. Included ω = 1/γ insight
