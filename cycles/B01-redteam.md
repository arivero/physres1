## Failure Modes
1. “Citation theater”: adding references that are adjacent but not supportive.
2. “OA mirage”: relying on unstable mirrors that will disappear.
3. “Overfitting”: picking one reference’s conventions and silently inheriting them.

## Mitigations
- For each new key, record (in `paper/bibliography.md`) *which* statement it anchors.
- Keep a convention map if the source uses different normalizations.
- Prefer arXiv / publisher OA; otherwise mark `PENDING` for later local ingestion.
