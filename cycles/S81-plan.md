# S81 Plan: Does the p=1 gauge-field preference have an independent half-density origin?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Determine whether the selection of p=1 (1-form gauge fields) at D=4 has a half-density origin independent of the RG/coupling-marginality argument in H4.0c. The deferred DX04 item asks: "revisit whether p=1 gauge-field preference has an independent half-density origin."

## Question
H4.0c states D = 2(p+1) for p-form gauge couplings to be marginal. At D=4, this selects p=1. The half-density operator filter (H4.0b) selects D=4 but says nothing about p. Does the half-density framework independently prefer 1-forms over other form degrees?

## Method
1. Review how p-form fields interact with half-density conjugation (HD-D1.3).
2. Check whether the D(4-D)/4 cancellation depends on the form degree of the field being acted upon.
3. Examine whether a p-form kinetic operator has its own half-density conjugation with form-degree-dependent coefficients.
4. Assess whether the half-density weight d/2 interacts with the de Rham degree p in a way that selects p=1 at d=4.

## Expected output
- Blackboard note with the analysis and conclusion.
- Clear statement of whether p=1 selection is purely RG or has a half-density component.
