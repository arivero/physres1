# S144 Plan: Dimensional regularization as non-lattice refinement scheme

Date: 2026-02-13

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md` (potential)

## Scope
Study dimensional regularization (d = 4 - ε) as an alternative refinement scheme where UV divergences appear as 1/ε poles rather than Λ → ∞ divergences. Minimal subtraction is the counterterm prescription. Same physics as cutoff → refinement-scheme independence. Blackboard slot 1.
