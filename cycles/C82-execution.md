# C82 Execution: Anchor the String-Tension Scale Supplier with a Wilson-Loop Definition

## Changes
- Updated `papers/planck-area/main.md` `Remark E4a` to include:
  - Wilson-loop static-potential definition for large rectangles,
  - area-law \(\Rightarrow\) string tension \(\sigma\) and linear potential,
  - OA anchor `[Greensite2003Confinement]`.

## Result
The string-tension scale-supplier option is now tied to a standard operational definition, not just dimensional analysis.
