# Q27 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Section bloat:** too many micro-remarks reduce readability.
2. **Metric misuse:** readers compare \(\chi\) values across incomparable reconstruction pipelines.
3. **Branch lock-in:** D1.5 thread monopolizes development and delays other themes.

## Mitigations
1. Keep future additions short and only when they remove ambiguity.
2. Emphasize instrument/model-specific calibration context.
3. Route the next study cycle to a distinct topic (distribution-derivative kernels).
