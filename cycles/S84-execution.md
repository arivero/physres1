# S84 Execution: Minimal hypotheses for "half-density scale → Planck area"

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work done

Wrote blackboard note (`blackboards/2026-02-13-minimal-hypotheses-planck-area.md`) that:

1. **Classified each hypothesis** in the chain PA-H2.1→...→PA-D1.3 as forced, physical principle, convention, or UV/coupling hypothesis.

2. **Identified non-bookkeeping content:**
   - d/2 exponent is forced by composition (S82/PA-D1.4a), not by definition
   - PA-H2.4 (background-free) is a physical principle: without it, metric-derived scalarization works in any d
   - PA-H2.5a (integrality) is a UV hypothesis: without it, transmutation supplies scales in any d
   - PA-D1.3a (three-mechanism obstruction) classifies WHY alternative d fails, not just THAT it fails

3. **Identified the bookkeeping:**
   - PA-H2.3 (dimensionless f) is a convention
   - The Diophantine equation k(d-2) = d/2 is necessary but not the "real" content

4. **Stated the minimal set:** PA-H2.1 + PA-H2.4 + PA-H2.5a + gravity-only → Planck area in d=4. Each ingredient is necessary: dropping any one defeats the conclusion.

## Key result
Open Problem #4 answered: the argument is more than dimensional bookkeeping because (a) composition forces d/2, (b) background-freeness is a physical principle, (c) integrality is a UV hypothesis, and (d) the three-mechanism obstruction classifies failures structurally.

## Promotion candidate
Could become a new subsection or extended remark in planck-area Section 3.1 ("Hypotheses as Separate Knobs"). The minimal-set summary is the most promotable part. Needs a C cycle.
