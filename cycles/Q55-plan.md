# Q55 Plan: Referee pass on C98 (step-doubling/rooted-tree witness)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C98`: add Euler step-doubling rooted-tree witness

## Goal
Referee-pass the `C98` manuscript changes for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q55-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Correctness: coefficient \(\frac{h^2}{4}\) and the modified-equation sign match the derivation witness.
- Notation: \(f'(f)\) meaning is unambiguous (evaluation point clear).
- Claim boundaries: “analogy witness” framing is explicit; no implication of Wilsonian coarse-graining.
- Reader flow: the new subsection reads as a self-contained computation (one-screen scan).

## Acceptance criteria
- A concrete list of follow-ups (if any), expressed as spawned cycles (not direct edits).
