# S72 Plan: Half-density conjugation vs conformal Laplacian — scope of the D=4 cancellation

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Verify HD-D1.3's D(4-D)/4 coefficient algebraically, compare the half-density conjugated Laplacian with the Yamabe operator, and determine whether the D=4 cancellation extends beyond the conformal metric class.

## Deliverable (keep bounded)
- Target: algebraic verification + structural comparison (3 key questions)
- Output file(s):
  - `blackboards/2026-02-12-half-density-conformal-D4.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S72-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Coefficient algebra independently verified (not just trusting HD-D1.3).
- Clear yes/no on: (1) is the half-density conjugation the Yamabe operator? (2) can the potential be written as xi*R? (3) does D=4 cancellation extend beyond conformal class?
- Discovery flag filled in.
