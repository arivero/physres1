# S191 Debate: Level of detail for constructive results

Date: 2026-02-13

## Question
Should the remark survey constructive QFT exhaustively (all models, all proofs) or focus on a few canonical examples and explicit open problems?

## Working answer
**Canonical examples + open problems.** A physics audience expects pointers to solvable cases (φ⁴₂, Gross-Neveu) and a clear statement of frontier questions (φ⁴₄, YM mass gap). Exhaustive survey would be a separate review article, not a remark.

## Next check
Verify that the remark reads as a *landscape summary* (what's known, what's open) rather than a *attribution thesaurus*. Mathematical physics community trusts proper citations but values clarity over completeness.
