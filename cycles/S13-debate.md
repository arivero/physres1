# S13 Debate

## Question
Does allowing string tension/\(\alpha'\) as an admissible universal scale undermine the “Planck area from half-densities” thesis, or does it sharpen it into a selection principle (“which universal area scale is admissible”)?

## Working Resolution
Treat “gravity-only” and “string-tension-allowed” as separate sieves/hypotheses:
1. gravity-only sieve singles out \(D=4\) with no fractional powers,
2. \(\alpha'\)-allowed sieve admits a universal area scale in any \(D\) multiple of 4 (integer powers of \(\alpha'\)), but changes what is being claimed.
