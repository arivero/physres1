# C228 Debate: Promote QND Measurement Remark

## Scope & Fit
Remark 5.7 follows Remark 5.6 and completes Section 5's measurement trilogy (decoherence, Zeno, QND). QND measurement is the most sophisticated approach and deserves dedicated treatment before section close.

## Physics Alignment
QND connects to action-angle framework:
- Action variables are protected by [A, H_sys] = 0 (conservation during evolution).
- QND probing adds [A, H_int] = 0 (non-invasive interaction).
- Cavity-QED example shows explicit realization (Rydberg states ↔ action quantum numbers).

## Pedagogy
Remark distinguishes QND from naïve "back-action-free" language and from Zeno collapse mechanics. Length is appropriate for a remark.

## Bibliography Fit
BraginskyVorontsovThorne1980 and Nogues1999 are canonical references; both fit naturally in action-angle measurement context.

## Consensus
Promotion is well-justified and provides logical closure to Section 5.
