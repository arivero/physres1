# S284 Debate: Is the parity obstruction physically meaningful or just bookkeeping?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
The parity lemma says integer-dimensional couplings cannot produce half-integer targets. But is this a deep physical fact, or just an artifact of the convention that "admitted couplings" have integer length dimensions (PA-H2.7a)?

## Working answer
It is a mixture: the integrality of coupling dimensions is itself physically meaningful (it follows from the action having dimension of energy*time = length^0 in natural units, and fields having integer or half-integer canonical dimensions determined by the kinetic term), but the specific boundary between "admitted" and "non-admitted" parameters is a convention choice (PA-H2.7a). The parity obstruction is real given the convention, and the convention is well-motivated, but it is not a theorem of nature.

The key point: the parity obstruction does not mean odd-d scalarization is impossible. It means odd-d scalarization cannot be achieved via the same mechanism (monomial sieve) that works for d=4. The transmutation route is the structurally appropriate alternative.

## Next check
Verify that no standard coupling with half-integer length dimension can sneak into the "admitted" set under a reasonable extension of PA-H2.7a.
