# B07 Plan: Wilson Loop / Confinement Anchors for the String-Tension Branch

## Goal
Add at least one strong OA anchor for the Wilson-loop definition of the static potential and the area-law/string-tension criterion, to support the "string tension as area-scale supplier" discussion in dependent drafts.

## Tasks
1. Identify an OA-accessible review/notes that explicitly states:
   - \(V(R) = -\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\ln\langle W(R\times T)\rangle\),
   - confinement criterion as area law \(\langle W\rangle \sim e^{-\sigma\,\text{Area}}\).
2. Add bibliography keys in `paper/bibliography.md` (DOI/arXiv and OA status).
3. Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- At least one new OA key added that is appropriate as an authoritative anchor.
- Any non-OA classic originals are marked `PENDING`.
