# C87 Red Team: Referee Risks for the Fermionic-Mediator Note

Date: 2026-02-10

## Likely objections
- “You’re claiming too much: fermions can induce forces.”
  - Mitigation: explicitly limit the claim to linear sourcing by commuting classical sources; mention loops/composites as standard routes.
- “Your ‘contact limit’ is only Born-level / convention-dependent.”
  - Mitigation: present the Fourier-transform identity as the invariant core; label overall prefactors as convention-dependent.
- “Point interactions are subtle / require renormalization.”
  - Mitigation: cite `[Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials]` and/or `[BonneauFarautValent2001SAE]`; state that RG enters when the contact limit is singular.
