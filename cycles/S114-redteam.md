## Failure modes
1. **Scattering amplitude formula**: f₀(k) = -a/(1+ika) is the standard effective-range result with zero effective range (k cot δ₀ = -1/a). Convention-independent. Verified: f₀(0) = -a (scattering length definition), pole at k = i/a gives E = -ℏ²/(2ma²).
2. **Divergence characterization**: d=3 contact interaction gives a linearly divergent loop integral — this is standard (Jackiw 1991, nuclear EFT literature).
3. **Schematic renormalization condition**: Writing "1/g₀ ∝ Λ + finite" avoids numerical factor issues while correctly conveying the structure. The proportionality constant involves m/ℏ² (determined by the loop integral) but is convention-dependent in detail.
