## Work
Added parenthetical cross-references to 3 remaining satellites:
1. **Uncuttable** → Introduction (after "refinement procedure with invariant content"): clarifies "uncuttable" = defined via refinement limit, not ontologically indivisible.
2. **Relativistic Central Orbits** → Section 3.3 (after areal law force-independence): L > K/c bound for relativistic inverse-square orbits.
3. **Fermionic Mediators** → Section 8.1 (after "contact interactions diverge"): contact limits as effective-theory residue of quantum loops.

All 9 satellites now cross-referenced from the cornerstone.
