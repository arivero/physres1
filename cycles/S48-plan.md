# S48 Plan: Weak Euler-Lagrange with δ and δ′ Probes (Jump Conditions)

## Goal
Make the "singular probes" item in `Heuristic H0.2` more operational by deriving, in a toy 1D setting, how δ and δ′ sources appear in weak Euler-Lagrange form and what discontinuities they encode (momentum jump vs position jump).

## Tasks
1. Write a short note with two explicit examples:
   - δ forcing produces a jump in conjugate momentum,
   - δ′ forcing produces a jump in the configuration variable (step).
2. Express everything in test-function duality language: δ probes values, δ′ probes derivatives.
3. Record a promotion target for a later `C` cycle (optional short pointer sentence, not a full derivation).

## Acceptance Tests
- Examples are algebraically correct and clearly distinguished from stationary-set deltas like δ(f′).
- The note is self-contained and usable as an internal reference (`paper/notes/...`).
