## Failure Modes
1. Treating the functional integral measure as mathematically rigorous without caveats.
2. Mixing “densitize by \(|g|^{1/4}\)” (a representation choice) with physical claims about universal scales.
3. Overreaching on BV formalism without sources.

## Mitigations
- Keep the computation finite and explicit (densitized scalar field).
- Label measure/field-space statements as heuristic and queue references for a future `B` cycle.
- Keep the half-density/scalarization distinction explicit.
