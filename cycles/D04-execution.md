# D04 Execution: Close the RCP Hardening Loop + Queue PENDING Source Hardening

Date: 2026-02-11

## Decision
- Chosen target: close out the completed RCP hardening wave in durable docs, then queue a bibliography hardening pass for the main paper’s most visible PENDING anchors (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`).
- Why now: it improves submission readiness without adding new speculative content; it is “finishing research” with direct reader payoff.

## One-sentence novelty claim (non-manuscript)
The RCP appendix now states compatibility as an explicit closure-with-parameter-update condition (“there exists \(\theta'\)”), anchored by a concrete semigroup-normalization witness, making the principle operational rather than purely slogan-level.

## Scope disclaimer (non-manuscript)
- No new manuscript edits in this cycle.
- Source acquisition is OA-first; if blocked, keep `PENDING` and document failure modes.

## Updates made
- `docs/research-log.md`: record `C90/Q48/C91` completion and current status.
- `docs/research-state.md`: update “Next Cycle Target” away from `S63 → C90 → Q48` to `B11` (PENDING anchor hardening).

## Spawned cycles
- `B11`: attempt OA ingestion for `Dirac1933` and `Feynman1948` (or record blocked attempts and keep `PENDING`).
