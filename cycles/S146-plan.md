# S146 Plan: Mandelstam-Tamm energy-time uncertainty

Date: 2026-02-13

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md` (potential)

## Scope
Study the Mandelstam-Tamm relation ΔE·Δt_A ≥ ℏ/2 as the temporal analog of the action-angle tradeoff. Energy eigenstates have d⟨A⟩/dt = 0 for all A — temporal analog of azimuthal uniformity. Blackboard slot 1.
