# S32 Execution: Non-Circular Planar Extension

## Work Completed
- Derived for general planar motion (not necessarily circular):
  \[
  \ell=\frac1m|\mathbf r\times\mathbf p|
  =\gamma r v_\perp
  =\gamma r^2\dot\phi,
  \]
  where \(v_\perp\) is tangential speed component.
- Area rates:
  \[
  \frac{dA}{dt}=\frac12 r^2\dot\phi=\frac{r v_\perp}{2}=\frac{\ell}{2\gamma},
  \qquad
  \frac{dA}{d\tau}=\gamma\frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{\ell}{2}.
  \]
- Recorded this as a kinematic identity independent of force law.

## Result
The minimal-structure rule extends beyond circular orbits for planar trajectories: fixing \(\ell\) is equivalent to fixing proper-time areal rate, while coordinate-time areal rate remains clock-dependent via \(\gamma\).
