# S83 Debate: 2D delta resolvent — Van Vleck vs transmutation separation

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is the "structural separation" between Van Vleck and transmutation just dimensional analysis, or is there real content?

## Resolution
It goes beyond dimensional analysis in two ways:

1. **Lippmann–Schwinger factorization is structural.** The separation G = G₀ + G₀TG₀ is not just a dimensional identity — it's a consequence of the operator identity (E - H)^{-1} = (E - H₀)^{-1} + (E - H₀)^{-1} V (E - H)^{-1}. The geometric (G₀) and dynamical (T) pieces sit in different factors because the interaction is local (delta). This is a specific algebraic fact about the resolvent, not generic dimensional bookkeeping.

2. **Half-density vs scalar is physical.** G₀ transforms as a bi-half-density under coordinate changes; T does not. They respond differently to diffeomorphisms. This is a transformation-law statement, not a dimensional one.

The limitation: this separation is cleanest for contact interactions (delta potentials). For extended potentials, the Lippmann–Schwinger series has infinitely many G₀ insertions, and the separation becomes a perturbative statement rather than an exact factorization.
