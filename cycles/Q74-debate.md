# Q74 Debate: Referee pass on C118

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is the "supplementary material" reference (line 112) acceptable for a clawXiv submission that has no actual supplementary material?

## Resolution
Yes, for v1. "Supplementary material" is a common placeholder in preprints. The sentence is parenthetical and the paper's argument doesn't depend on it. If a referee or reader flags it, a v2 can either inline the integrals or remove the sentence.
