# Q39 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Analogy confusion**: readers take the toy too literally.
2. **List fatigue**: H0.2 becomes a stack of parentheticals.
3. **Loss of focus**: divergence seems "solved" by calculus rather than motivating RG.

## Mitigations
1. Keep "toy witness" wording and avoid identification language.
2. Keep each parenthetical to one line and avoid further expansion.
3. Later sections must still present an actual divergent refinement computation requiring RG flow (already present via 2D contact interaction).
