# S187 Execution: QND Measurement Blackboard

## Blackboard Written
Created `/Users/arivero/physarticle/blackboards/1-qnd-measurement.md` on quantum non-demolition measurement of action variables, covering QND conditions, back-action physics, and cavity-QED realization.

## Subagent Review
Launched quantum optics experimentalist persona (Task tool). Reviewer identified 9 issues:
- **HIGH (2):**
  - Missing explicit [A, H_int] = 0 commutator condition alongside [A, H_sys] = 0.
  - "Back-action-free" claim is imprecise; back-action is redirected to conjugate, not absent.
- **MEDIUM (4):**
  - Natural QND vs. engineered QND conflation.
  - Dispersive interaction notation clarity.
  - Nogues et al. (1999) cavity-QED details (Rydberg ↔ photon coupling).
  - Zeno effect conceptually distinct from QND measurement.
- **LOW (3):** Decoherence contrast, experimental timeline, reference completeness.

## Corrections Applied
All 9 issues resolved:
- Expanded QND conditions to dual commutators.
- Reframed back-action as conjugate redistribution.
- Clarified engineered vs. natural QND regimes.
- Added cavity-QED details (Rydberg atoms, Ramsey interferometry).
- Separated Zeno from QND in dedicated subsection.

## Status
Blackboard finalized, ready for C228 promotion.
