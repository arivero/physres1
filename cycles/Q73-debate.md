# Q73 Debate: Should the "triple resonance" observation from S81 be promoted?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
S81 identified a "triple resonance" at (D=4, p=1): the number 2 = D/2 serves as area weight, field-strength form degree, and gravity coupling dimension. Should this be added to the manuscripts?

## Recommendation
No, not at this time. H4.0c already captures the essential content ("consistency of two logically independent filters at D=4 is a nontrivial structural check"). Adding a third filter (the coupling-dimension sieve from PA-D1.3) would create a "triple" but the added conceptual value is marginal — the reader can see that D/2 = 2 = d-2 at d=4 from the existing text.

If the manuscripts eventually need a consolidated "why D=4" summary section, the triple resonance would be natural to include there. But adding it piecemeal to H4.0c would overload an already dense heuristic.
