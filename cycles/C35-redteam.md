## Failure Modes
1. Conflating three different constructions: \(\delta(f')\), \(\delta'\), and “functional deltas” in path integrals.
2. Overstating rigor of corner/jump treatments without stating regularity assumptions.
3. Turning the synthesis note into a variational-calculus mini-textbook.

## Mitigations
- Keep the additions strictly definitional: one short subsection distinguishing objects and one short weak Euler–Lagrange remark.
- Explicitly label functional-integral extensions as heuristic (already in the draft’s Outlook).
- Defer any extended corner/jump lemma to a separate note if needed.
