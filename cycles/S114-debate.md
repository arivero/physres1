## Decision
Added Example 5.2 (3D contact interaction) to complete the dimensional comparison: d=1 (well-defined), d=2 (log divergence, Example 5.1), d=3 (linear divergence, Example 5.2). Used the universally defined scattering amplitude f₀ rather than the T-matrix to avoid convention-dependent sign issues flagged by the subagent review.
