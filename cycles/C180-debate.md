# C180 Debate: Real harmonics Remark 3.1

Date: 2026-02-13

## Decisions
- Placed after Section 3 statement (azimuthal uniformity) as the simplest counter-example.
- Used descriptive language ("real and imaginary parts") instead of explicit formulas to avoid Condon-Shortley vs. Racah convention issue.
- Connected to Section 4 Fourier tradeoff for forward reference.
