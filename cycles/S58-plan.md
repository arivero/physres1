# S58 Plan: \(\tau\) as a Compare-at-Fixed-Ruler Lemma (Regulator-Independent)

## Goal
Rewrite the control-map idea in `Derivation D6.0` as a regulator-independent lemma:
\(\tau_b\) is induced by "refine then compare at a fixed ruler."

## Acceptance
1. Write a short internal note formalizing the compare-at-fixed-ruler viewpoint with one explicit witness.
2. Identify the minimal edits needed to tighten `paper/main.md` `Derivation D6.0` in a follow-up content cycle.
3. Update logs (`docs/research-log.md`, `cycles/index.md`) and commit/push.

## Output
- `paper/notes/compare-at-fixed-ruler-control-map-tau.md`
- Cycle logs for `S58`.
