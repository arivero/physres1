# C212 — Debate

## Summary
Clean promotion. The S171 blackboard had already been corrected in
response to all four reviewer objections, so no further changes were
needed during promotion.

The remark fits naturally after Remark 4.7 (which discusses refinement
equivalences abstractly) by providing concrete physical examples —
Kramers–Wannier, T-duality, Montonen–Olive — where distinct
descriptions converge to the same underlying physics.

No issues raised during promotion.
