# B05 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. Adding references that don’t actually cover circular-orbit constraints (too off-topic).
2. Using non-OA textbook citations without marking `PENDING`.
3. Letting the bibliography drive the derivation (herd-following).

## Mitigations
1. Spot-check the ingested PDFs for the relevant sections (equations + circular solutions).
2. OA-first; otherwise mark `PENDING` and defer.
3. Keep S24 derivation-first; bibliography is anchoring only.
