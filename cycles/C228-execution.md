# C228 Execution: Promote QND Measurement Remark

## Remark Inserted
Inserted Remark 5.7 after Remark 5.6 at the end of Section 5 in `/Users/arivero/physarticle/papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md`.

## Content Summary
- **Dual QND conditions:** [A, H_sys] = 0 AND [A, H_int] = 0 (both action conservation and interaction preservation required).
- **Back-action physics:** Back-action redirected to conjugate variable (momentum if measuring position), not absent.
- **Cavity-QED realization:** Rydberg atoms in dispersive cavity with Ramsey interferometry (adiabatic Stark shift).
- **Zeno vs. QND:** Conceptually orthogonal mechanisms for decoherence suppression (collapse vs. non-invasive).
- **Section 5 trilogy:** Completes measurement narrative (decoherence, Zeno, QND).

## Bibliography
Added 2 entries:

- Nogues1999: Cavity-QED experimental realization
