# D12 Debate: modified-equation witness for “running data” in step-doubling

Date: 2026-02-11

## Hard question
Does adding a “modified equation” expansion meaningfully strengthen the RG analogy, or is it an avoidable numerical-analysis detour?

## Current resolution
It strengthens the analogy *if kept bounded*: one explicit Euler computation (no B-series machinery) that cleanly exhibits “effective data depends on the refinement scale” and identifies the rooted-tree order-2 differential \(f'(f)\). The promotion should be phrased as a toy witness, not as a claim that numerical analysis *is* RG.
