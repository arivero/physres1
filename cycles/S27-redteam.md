# S27 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overreach:** presenting the SR interpolation as a fundamental quantum-gravity claim.
2. **Areal-speed ambiguity:** mixing \(dA/dt\) and \(dA/d\tau\) without saying which is fixed.
3. **Cross-model contamination:** combining SR kinematics with Newtonian inverse-square force and forgetting it is a hybrid model.

## Mitigations
1. Label the result as a model-level witness and keep GR/QFT caveats explicit.
2. Fix the convention to coordinate-time areal speed \(\dot A_0=dA/dt\) throughout.
3. Keep derivation steps explicit and separate from interpretation claims.
