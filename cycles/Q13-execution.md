# Q13 Execution: Relativistic-Central-Orbits Draft Review

## Checks Run
- Read-through of `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`.
- Verified citations keys exist:
  - `[BoscagginDambrosioFeltrin2020RelKepler]`
  - `[Carroll1997LectureGR]`
- Quick scan for cycle-label strings in the draft (none).

## Findings
- Scope is disciplined: SR power-law + inverse-square bound, then Schwarzschild baseline + photon sphere; stability deferred.
- Claims are phrased as constraints/witnesses, not as dimension-selection proofs.
- Units are explicit and restored in the GR section.

## Fixes
- None required in this pass.
