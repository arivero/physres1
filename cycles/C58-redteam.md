# C58 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overreach:** readers treat the rule as universally valid outside central-source models.
2. **Abstraction overload:** added notation obscures the practical takeaway.
3. **Rule drift:** future cycles forget this and reintroduce unstated clock choices.

## Mitigations
1. Keep explicit branch-scoping language in the remark.
2. Pair formula with plain-language operational sentence.
3. Keep Q-cycle checks focused on branch assumptions near D1.5b-f.
