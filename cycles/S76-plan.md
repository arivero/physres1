# S76 Plan: Linear vs nonlinear beta — when does a semigroup generate transmutation?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Clarify the structural boundary between D6.2a-sg's semigroup (linear beta, no transmutation) and PA-D1.6a's transmutation mechanism (nonlinear beta, essential singularity). Cross-thread probe connecting Thread 1 (main paper RG) and Thread 2 (Planck-area scale-supplier).

## Deliverable (keep bounded)
- Target: 1-page analysis comparing the two beta functions, proving that linear β cannot generate a transmutation scale, and identifying the order-of-vanishing criterion (β ~ (g-g*)^n with n ≥ 2 for transmutation).
