# D50 Discovery: Is (D) partially derivable from (C)?

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent thread: D49 (P4.2 ↔ RCP axiom mapping)

## Novelty target
Determine whether dimensional homogeneity hypothesis (D): [K]=length^{-d} is forced by
composition (C) on ℝ^d, thereby further reducing P4.2's independent hypothesis count.

## Observation
The composition integral on M=ℝ^d:
$$K(x,y;T) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} K(x,z;t_1) K(z,y;t_2) \, d^d z$$
imposes [K]²·[L]^d = [K], forcing [K] = [L]^{-d}.

This means (D) splits into:
- (D₁): [K] = L^{-d} — derivable from (C) on ℝ^d
- (D₂): dimensional constants are {M, L, T}-typed — physical input about the Lagrangian

## Success criteria
1. Rigorous verification that [K]=L^{-d} follows from (C) alone on ℝ^d
2. Identify what remains of (D) after removing (D₁): is (D₂) an axiom or a triviality?
3. Updated P4.2 effective hypothesis count
4. Determine whether this observation applies on curved M (where dz → √|g| dz)

## Blackboard slot
Append to blackboard 0 (D49 analysis) as Section 7.
