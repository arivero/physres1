## Blackboard
Wrote blackboard slot 2: Richardson extrapolation as minimal subtraction.
5 claims covering Richardson formula, Romberg tableau, MS-bar analogy, Romberg=Richardson+trapezoidal, structural point.
## Reviewer feedback (numerical analyst — edited blackboard directly)
All 5 claims CORRECT. Caveats on claim 3 (MS-bar analogy needs exponent p and expansion structure; epistemology differs slightly) and claim 5 (philosophical direction: numerical analysis assumes true limit, renormalization may define the theory). Overall: solid, suitable for promotion.
