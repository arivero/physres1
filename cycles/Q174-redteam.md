# Q174 Red Team: Referee attacks on C291

Date: 2026-02-14

## Likely referee objections
- "Curved-manifold benchmark is still local-chart language, not global spectral analysis."
  - Mitigation: keep explicit scope boundary and treat this as witness-level closure.
- "Sign conventions in adjoint-difference identities can be fragile."
  - Mitigation: if challenged, add a short 1D reduction check in a follow-up C-cycle.
