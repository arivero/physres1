## Decision
Chose the hydrogen atom as a third witness rather than: (a) Gap 2 stationary-phase verification (more impactful but cornerstone-focused), (b) WKB/EBK formalism (too formal for a "referee-safe" witness note), (c) 2D oscillator (less distinctive than hydrogen). The hydrogen atom adds genuine new content: the full 3-torus structure with SO(4) degeneracy, which goes beyond the single-pair witnesses and supports the satellite's outlook on multi-action systems.
