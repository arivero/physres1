# C76 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Too terse**: readers cannot parse \(-\hat p\hat q\) vs \(-\hat q\hat p\) without context.
2. **Tone drift**: the Introduction starts to look like a list of technical caveats.
3. **Incorrect claim**: ambiguity phrased as "inevitable" rather than "requires prescription".

## Mitigations
1. Keep it framed as a "minimal witness" and avoid extra algebra in the Introduction.
2. Maintain the constructive arc: obstruction -> control mechanism -> later derivations.
3. Keep the statement conditional: discretization choices can yield quantum-distinct operators unless a prescription/equivalence is fixed.
