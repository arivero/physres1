# C320 Execution: Expand RCP Foundations Sections 4-7

Date: 2026-02-14

## What was expanded
Sections 4-7 of `papers/rcp-foundations/main.md` (189 → 305 lines, +116)

## Content added
**Section 4: Ordering Ambiguity (~30 lines)**
- Left vs Weyl ordering for f(q)p
- Difference: O(ℏ) controlled shift
- Domain data witness (delta-contact extensions)
- RCP: representation changes require transporting ordering + domain parameters

**Section 5: 2D Delta RG (~35 lines)**
- Loop integral divergence (logarithmic)
- Renormalized coupling g_R(μ), beta function
- Dimensional transmutation (RG-invariant κ_*)
- RCP: scale changes require coupling flow for closure

**Section 6: P4.2 Theorem (~25 lines)**
- Statement: A1+A2+A5 force κ with [κ]=[action]
- Both κ→0 and κ→∞ fail (catastrophic)
- RCP: partition compatibility forces ℏ-necessity

**Section 7: Outlook (~26 lines)**
- Three crown witnesses (partition/representation/scale)
- Foundational reading (structural constants emergent)
- Open questions (additional channels, categorical structure, gravity)

## Diffstat
```
papers/rcp-foundations/main.md: +116 -0 (189 → 305 lines)
TOTAL: +116 -0
```

## Impact
- RCP paper now COMPLETE at ~6-7pp (target was 6-9pp)
- All 7 sections substantive (no templates remaining)
- 3 worked examples + theorem + outlook
- Ready for quality pass or submission polish

## Guard checks
- ✓ No cycle IDs
- ✓ All sections complete
- ✓ Self-contained (can be read without [Main], though it references it)
