# C229 Execution: Promote Crossing Symmetry into Fermionic Paper

## Work Done
1. Inserted Remark 2.2 after line 38 (following Remark 2.1)
2. Included Mandelstam analyticity assumption statement
3. Added Grassmann obstruction orthogonality clarification
4. Included fermion crossing spinor sign formulas

## Content Added
```
**Remark 2.2** (Crossing Symmetry & Grassmann Obstruction).
Mandelstam analyticity in the s, t, u channels is an assumption, not a derived theorem.
The Grassmann obstruction (fermionic source nature) is orthogonal to channel decomposition.
Fermion crossing involves spinor signs: Ψ̄→(−1)^F Ψ in crossing transformations.

## Checks
- Cycle-tag leak: PASS (no C### in rendered text)
- Transcript mention: PASS (no conv_patched)

## Status
Ready for commit (C229 → Cnn-execution files first, then cycles/docs).
