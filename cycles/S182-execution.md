Wrote blackboard 0: Källén-Lehmann spectral representation. Reviewed by mathematical physicist (axiomatic QFT specialist). Key corrections applied: (1) sign/i-factor convention clarified, (2) "always attractive" qualified with spin-dependent sign, (3) spectral positivity reframed as unitarity not boson-specific, (4) fermion spectral decomposition simplified.
