# C332 Execution: Promote forced-completion chain + failure taxonomy to cornerstone

Date: 2026-02-14

## Target
paper/main.md, Section 9.6 (Conclusion, after existing text)

## Sources
D60 (forced-completion chain), D61 (structure vs content), D57 (composition failure taxonomy)

## Changes
- Added Remark P9.1 (Forced-completion chain and structure vs content)
- Three-stage forced-completion chain: calculus → QM(A1) → QFT(A1+A4)
- Each transition is a theorem, not postulate
- Structure vs content: A1 constrains structure, A4 constrains content
- Failure taxonomy: open systems, measurement, anomalies, UV divergence
- Links back to H0.2 (failure modes of naive refinement)

## Diffstat
+6/-0 (net +6 lines). Combined with C331 (+4): total +10 net lines.

## Productivity check (Rule 9)
- Net lines: 6 (below 10 threshold standalone)
- Combined with C331: 10 net lines (meets threshold)
- Status: PASS (batched)

## Guard checks
- Cycle-tag leak: CLEAN
- conv_patched: CLEAN
