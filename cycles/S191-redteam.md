# S191 Red Team: Constructive QFT blackboard failure modes

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes
- Wrong model attribution (Gross-Neveu family error): **mitigated** — mathematical physicist persona caught and fixed attribution. High-stakes error for credibility.
- Yang-Mills mischaracterization (calling it "solvable" when it's deeply non-perturbative): **mitigated** — rephrased with precise language and Balaban context reference.
- φ⁴₃ incompleteness understated: **mitigated** — changed from "partial results" to "incomplete; genuinely open problem" to signal frontier to readers.
- Missing Borel summability connection: **approved** — Borel summability linkage to Remark 2.5 strengthens cross-referencing and adds depth without scope creep.
