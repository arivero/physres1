# C111 Red Team: What could go wrong?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes

- **"The formula might have a sign or coefficient error"**
  - Response: verified by two independent methods in S74 (operator algebra + Weyl kernel). Both agree on -iℏf'p̂ - ¼ℏ²f''.

- **"The cross-reference to HD-D1.3 creates a dependency on the companion note"**
  - Response: the remark is self-contained — it states the formula and the half-density resolution without requiring the reader to consult the companion note. The cross-reference is informational ("cf."), not load-bearing.

- **"Adding to Section 10.2 makes it too long"**
  - Response: Section 10.2 was 36 lines; D9.1a adds 8 lines. Total ~44 lines is still concise for an appendix section with two worked examples.

- **"The 'half-density resolution' claim is too strong for a remark"**
  - Response: the claim is standard differential geometry: conjugating a second-order operator by a density weight eliminates the first-derivative term. This is precisely what HD-D1.3 establishes. The remark only notes the fact; it does not prove it.
