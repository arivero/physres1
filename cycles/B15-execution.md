# B15 Execution: Add Berkeley (1734) "The Analyst" to bibliography

Date: 2026-02-12

## Summary
Added [Berkeley1734Analyst] to all three sections of `paper/bibliography.md`:
- Sources (entry #33): full bibliographic data + one-line description.
- DOI Audit (entry #34): no DOI (18th-century source).
- OA Acquisition Status (entry #33): Wikisource full text + Internet Archive scan.

## Work log
1. Web search confirmed OA availability via Wikisource, Internet Archive, and Project Gutenberg (in collected works).
2. Added entries to all three sections.
3. Source not yet ingested into `sources/` (deferred — citation key is for historical framing, not technical content extraction).

## Notes
- The Analyst is relevant to the manuscript's "Zeno-style refinement paradox" framing (Section 1). Berkeley's "ghosts of departed quantities" objection is the historical precursor to the manuscript's constructive refinement approach.
- Citation key [Berkeley1734Analyst] is not yet referenced in any manuscript. A future C cycle should add a brief historical note in Section 1 or Section 3.1.

## Spawned cycles
- None (the C cycle to use this citation will be planned after S69).
