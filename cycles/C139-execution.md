# C139 Execution: Add vacuum polarization example to fermionic mediators paper
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
Added Section 3.1 ("The controlled alternative: fermion loops modify bosonic propagators"):
- Standard vacuum polarization formula: α_eff(q²) = α/(1-Π(q²))
- Fermion one-loop self-energy of the photon gives logarithmic correction.
- At low |q| << m_e, correction is analytic in q² → produces local operators C₀ + C₂q² + ···
- Structural point: fermions → forces path runs through quantum loop, not tree-level Gaussian.

Paper: 95 → 112 lines (+17 net).
