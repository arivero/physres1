# S67 Debate: promotion-ready Euler modified equation + explicit \(f'(y)[f(y)]\) notation

Date: 2026-02-11

## Hard question
Will the modified-equation remark confuse readers who only want the step-doubling discrepancy as a rooted-tree witness?

## Current resolution
Keep the modified-equation content as a short, explicitly labeled remark (“optional interpretation”), and lead with the step-doubling discrepancy. Define \(f'(y)[v]\) before any shorthand is used.
