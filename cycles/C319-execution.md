# C319 Execution: Initial RCP Foundations Paper Draft

Date: 2026-02-14

## What was created
New satellite paper: `papers/rcp-foundations/main.md` (189 lines, initial draft)

## Structure (8 sections, 3 complete + 4 outlined)
**Complete sections:**
1. Introduction (core question, operational form, three channels, relation to companion)
2. Axioms (A1-A5, commuting diagrams)
3. Worked Example: Noether's Theorem (partition channel, full derivation + RCP interpretation)

**Outlined sections (to be expanded later):**
4. Ordering Ambiguity (representation channel, template)
5. 2D Delta Renormalization (scale channel, template)
6. P4.2 as Crown Witness (theorem statement, template)
7. Outlook (crown witnesses, foundational reading, template)
8. References (3 refs: [Main], Arnold, Landsman)

## Key content
- RCP operational form: \(\mathcal{O}_{h,\theta} = \mathcal{O}_{h',\tau(\theta)} \circ \mathcal{T}\) (falsifiable!)
- 5 axioms (composition, identity, representation equivalence, scale invariance, dimensional homogeneity)
- Noether's theorem as partition-compatibility witness (~40 lines, complete derivation)
- Commuting diagram template for multi-channel compatibility

## Expansion path
Current: 189 lines (foundation, ~3-4pp compiled estimate)
Next steps:
- Expand Section 4 (ordering, from [Main] Section 10.2, ~1pp)
- Expand Section 5 (RG, from [Main] Section 10.5, ~1pp)
- Expand Section 6 (P4.2 theorem, ~1pp)
- Expand Section 7 (outlook + crown witnesses, ~1pp)
Target: 6-9pp complete paper

## Guard checks
- ✓ No cycle IDs
- ✓ Complete structure (all sections present)
- ✓ Substantive content in sections 1-3
