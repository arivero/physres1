# C98 Debate: How much tree machinery belongs in a promotion?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Should the promotion include third-order trees (branch vs chain), or keep only the order-2 \(f'(f)\) witness?

## Current position
Keep only the order-2 witness (plus one-line modified-equation remark). Anything beyond that starts to look like a B-series tutorial and dilutes the note’s physics-facing scope.

## What would change my mind?
- If the referee pass flags the witness as “too informal” unless one more explicit term is shown.
