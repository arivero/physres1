# C115 Plan: Promote S77 hierarchy into Planck-area draft (Remark PA-E5a)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Add a remark (PA-E5a) after PA-E5 in the Planck-area draft that:
1. Notes the half-density dimension match (κ*^{-1} = length^{d/2} for d = 2).
2. States the three-level RG hierarchy: semigroup ⊃ transmutation ⊃ dimension sieve.
3. Cross-references the three witnesses (D6.2a-sg, 2D delta, PA-D1.3).
4. Notes transmutation is dimension-permissive.

## Target manuscripts (must edit >=1)
- `papers/planck-area/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- One remark block (~8 lines) after PA-E5, before §3.4

Out of scope:
- Editing the main paper (paper/main.md)
- Adding new derivations

## Minimum promotion bar
One remark block with structured content (dimension match + hierarchy + witnesses).

## Allowed files
- `papers/planck-area/main.md`
- `cycles/C115-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`, `docs/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Manuscript changed substantively. Diffstat recorded. Guard checks N/A (companion note, not main paper).
