# D26 Debate: Is this redundant with existing kernel witnesses?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Given Appendix 10.6 already contains exact semigroup kernel witnesses (free + HO + bounded \(V\)), is a heat-kernel “QFT-grade” witness actually new, or redundant?

## Working answer
Not redundant: Appendix 10.6 is a *QM-style* kernel-composition witness. The heat-kernel witness is *QFT-facing* and links directly to diagonal counterterms and \(D/2\) pole structure (Seeley–DeWitt / proper time), which Appendix 10.6 does not cover.

## Next check
Make sure the deliverable is genuinely additive: one explicit curvature/counterterm computation, not a rephrasing of 10.6.
