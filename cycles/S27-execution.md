# S27 Execution: SR Link to the Planck-Areal-Speed Branch

## Work Completed
- Derived the inverse-square (\(q=2\)) SR continuation under fixed coordinate-time areal speed \(\dot A_0=dA/dt\):
  \[
  r(M,\dot A_0)=\frac{4\dot A_0^2}{GM}\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{GM}{2\dot A_0 c}\right)^2}.
  \]
- Specialized to \(\dot A_0=cL_P\), obtaining
  \[
  r(M)=\frac{4\hbar}{Mc}\sqrt{1+\frac{M^2}{4M_P^2}}.
  \]
- Recorded limits:
  - \(M\ll M_P:\ r\approx 4\hbar/(Mc)\) (Compton-like branch),
  - \(M\gg M_P:\ r\to 2L_P\) (Planck-length floor in this model).
- For \(2<q<3\), combined S26 stability with fixed areal speed to get only a kinematic lower bound
  \[
  r>\frac{2\dot A_0}{c\sqrt{3-q}},
  \]
  but no equally clean closed counterpart to the inverse-square witness.

## Result
The SR continuation yields a clean, promotable statement for inverse-square forces: the Newtonian Compton scaling deforms into a relativistic interpolation with a finite Planck-length saturation when \(\dot A_0=cL_P\). Beyond inverse-square, the link is weaker (bound-level only).
