# S48 Debate: δ′ as a Physical Probe or a Bookkeeping Device?

## Question
Should δ′ be treated as a physically meaningful "probe of derivative at a point", or merely as a bookkeeping artifact from integrating by parts / using discontinuous trajectories?

## Current Resolution
Treat δ′ primarily as a **bookkeeping object** that becomes unavoidable when:
- trajectories have corners/steps, or
- the action includes point-supported terms that effectively couple to derivatives.
Then interpret any physical meaning only after specifying the admissible trajectory class and regularization convention.
