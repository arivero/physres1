# S60 Plan: Planck Areal Speed Circular Orbit Witness

## Goal
Answer the Planck-areal-speed circular orbit question with a clean algebraic derivation and record any consistency constraints.

## Acceptance
1. Write a short blackboard note with the derivation and assumptions.
2. Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.
3. Commit and push.

## Output
- `blackboards/2026-02-10-planck-areal-speed-circular-orbit.md`
