# S28 Execution: Proper-Time Areal-Speed Branch

## Work Completed
- Re-derived the inverse-square SR branch while fixing
  \[
  \dot A_\tau:=\frac{dA}{d\tau}
  \]
  instead of \(\dot A_t=dA/dt\).
- Obtained the gravitational radius formula
  \[
  r(M,\dot A_\tau)=\frac{4\dot A_\tau^2}{GM}\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{GM}{2\dot A_\tau c}\right)^2},
  \]
  with admissibility condition \(GM<2\dot A_\tau c\).
- For \(\dot A_\tau=cL_P\), this becomes
  \[
  r(M)=\frac{4\hbar}{Mc}\sqrt{1-\frac{M^2}{4M_P^2}},
  \]
  so:
  - \(M\ll M_P\): same Compton-like leading term \(4\hbar/(Mc)\),
  - \(M\to2M_P^{-}\): \(r\to0\) (no Planck-floor saturation).

## Result
The high-mass \(2L_P\) floor found in D1.5b is not invariant under this time-parameter convention; it is specific to fixing coordinate-time areal speed. The low-mass Compton branch is shared by both conventions.
