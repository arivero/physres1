# C08 Debate

## Claim
The appendix should include one explicit subtraction/running computation, not only structural RG statements.

## Objection
A toy formula may look detached from a concrete field model.

## Resolution
Keep the derivation minimal and explicit, and label it as a perturbative template rather than a model-specific theorem.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Scheme-change handling should be included to avoid overclaiming universality.

## Objection
This can overcomplicate a short appendix.

## Resolution
Add one compact proposition: leading beta coefficient stability under analytic reparametrization at shown order.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
The cycle should continue even if some bibliography binaries remain pending.

## Objection
Missing binaries can block citation-level confidence.

## Resolution
Proceed using available OA anchors and mark unresolved items with explicit `PENDING` files for later local ingestion.

## Status
Accepted.
