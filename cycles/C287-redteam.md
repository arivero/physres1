## Failure modes
1. Rule appears over-generalized beyond high-momentum asymptotics.
2. Added text pushes paper beyond PLB room budget.

## Mitigations
1. Keep wording scoped to asymptotic fixed-\(L\) barrier analysis.
2. Keep addition compact (single remark block); verify page count in P preflight.
