# S93 Execution: Action-angle paper content expansion assessment
Date: 2026-02-13

## Assessment
The paper's Outlook (Section 6) mentions that "beyond the (φ,L_z) sector, integrable central problems admit a fuller action–angle description." This is the natural insertion point.

## Recommendation
Add a harmonic oscillator example (Example 6.1) before the Outlook paragraph. This is the simplest 1D integrable system beyond the circle: Fock states are action eigenstates with delocalized orbit phase; coherent states localize phase at the cost of broad action/number distribution. This makes the paper's thesis visible in a second, independent setting without entering the Kepler/Runge-Lenz subtleties.

Expected addition: ~12–15 net lines.
