## Decision
The Trotter product formula is the mathematical backbone of the path integral's refinement-limit character. Making it explicit strengthens the satellite's argument by providing a rigorous theorem behind the informal discussion in Section 3. The Suzuki–Trotter splitting adds the convergence-rate angle, showing that non-commutativity (quantum mechanics) affects HOW FAST the refinement converges, not just WHETHER it converges.
