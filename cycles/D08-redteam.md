# D08 Red Team: Conformal half-density Laplacian witness risks

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Algebra/sign mistake in the expansion:
  - Mitigation: do an independent symbolic check (spawn `S65`) and record code + output.
- “4D specialness” over-interpretation:
  - Mitigation: add an explicit scope disclaimer in the promoted manuscript text; keep it as a worked simplification.
- Hidden bibliography debt (conformal Laplacian / Yamabe operator confusion):
  - Mitigation: keep the statement strictly about the conjugated operator we define; do not claim conformal covariance unless a dedicated `B` cycle supplies an anchor.
