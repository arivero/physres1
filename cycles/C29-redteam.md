## Failure Modes
1. Over-editing: making cosmetic changes that churn the text without improving clarity.
2. Adding disclaimers that weaken the core sieve statements.

## Mitigations
- Keep to two tiny clarifiers: one cross-pointer, one “this is a knob” sentence.
- Do not change any formulas or branch structure.
