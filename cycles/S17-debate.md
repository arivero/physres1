# S17 Debate: Is the Conformal “Dimension Filter” Redundant With the Planck-Area Sieve?

## Hard Question
Does the D=4 simplification of the half-density conjugated Laplacian in a conformal background add anything beyond the existing Planck-area dimensional sieve (H2.5), or is it redundant?

## Current Resolution
It is **not redundant**: it is a different kind of filter.
- The H2.5 sieve is about *dimension-matching of scalarization scales* using admissible couplings.
- The conformal Laplacian observation is about *simplicity of how kinetic operators transform under scalarization gauge changes* (no \((\partial\sigma)^2\) term) in a natural metric class.

They should be tracked as separate hypotheses/filters and only compared later.
