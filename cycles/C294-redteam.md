## Failure modes
1. Hyperbolic-function identities used for semigroup closure may be misstated.
2. Units/conventions may be inconsistent with D12.1-D12.2 notation.
3. Claim may overgeneralize beyond confining quadratic potentials.

## Mitigations
1. Keep closure statement tied to standard Mehler Gaussian integration identities.
2. State local unit convention explicitly for Appendix 10.6 formulas.
3. Restrict claims to Euclidean, confining (`omega>0`) case.
