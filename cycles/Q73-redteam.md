# Q73 Red Team: Risks in the current framing of D=4 filter independence

Date: 2026-02-12

## Potential weaknesses
- **Risk**: a referee could argue that "independent filters agreeing at D=4" is not nontrivial but tautological (they all derive from properties of the number 4). Mitigation: the mechanisms are genuinely different (algebraic vs differential-geometric vs power-counting), and the independence means each could in principle fail independently. This is stated in H4.0c.

- **Risk**: the phrase "universal coefficient" in H4.0b might be misread as "universal across all form degrees." Mitigation: the context ("scalar Laplacian... conjugation") makes the scope clear. However, adding "(for the scalar kinetic operator)" would remove ambiguity. This is a minor wording improvement, not a structural issue. Flagged for a future C cycle if desired.

## Assessment
Low risk. Current framing is accurate and well-scoped.
