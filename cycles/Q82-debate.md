# Q82 Debate

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Should this note adopt the labeled-block style (Derivation RCO-D1.1, etc.) used in other satellites?

## Resolution
No, not in this pass. The paper works as a short note (207 lines, 6 sections) with clear section headings and boxed results. Adding labeled blocks would be a style refactor, not a content improvement. If a future Q pass or reviewer requests consistency with the other satellites, it can be added then. The priority now is removing the three concrete issues (internal path, meta-language, empty metadata) so the paper can reach Tier 1.
