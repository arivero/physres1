# Q98 Execution: Subagent-delegated referee pass
Date: 2026-02-13

## Method
First use of subagent-delegated Q passes per AGENTS.md policy update.
Two parallel subagent referees with fresh context reviewed the papers.

## Fixes applied
### Uncuttable:
- Remark 2.2: clarified both readings — Taylor coefficient f^(k)/k! and derivative f^(k) with appropriate divisor.

### Dirac Probes:
- Abstract: added "in dimension d≥2" qualifier for renormalization claim.
- Outlook: removed strikethrough editorial artifact, rewrote item 1 cleanly.
- References: added [FeynmanHibbs1965] for Section 4.5 path integral content.

## Deferred (acceptable as-is)
- "Cornerstone manuscript" not cited: this is standard companion-note convention in this project.
- Theorem 3.1-3.2 proofs compressed: intentional — detailed proofs in Gelfand-Fomin.
- Greek typesetting in uncuttable: minor, can fix in future B cycle.

## Assessment
Subagent delegation produced significantly better criticism than in-context Q passes.
The uncuttable referee caught a genuine math imprecision (Remark 2.2) and the Dirac Probes
referee caught the abstract inconsistency with Section 5.3.
