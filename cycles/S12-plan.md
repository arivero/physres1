# S12 Plan

## Goal
Support the RG follow-up paper’s “delta interaction as witness” story by recording the explicit cutoff loop integrals \(I_d(E;\Lambda)\) for contact interactions in:
1. \(d=1\) (finite for the simple \(\delta\) potential),
2. \(d=2\) (log divergence; marginal running),
3. \(d=3\) (linear divergence; power subtraction).

## Scope
1. Write a blackboard note with the explicit formulas and asymptotics.
2. Identify promotion candidates for `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`.

## Non-Goals
- No edits to manuscripts in this cycle.
- No bibliography ingestion.

## Acceptance Tests
1. New blackboard note exists in `blackboards/` with the 1D/2D/3D formulas.
2. Note lists a concrete promotion target in the RG draft.
