# D25 Debate: Is stochastic re-interpretation actually useful here?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does adding a stochastic interpretation clarify the refinement-composition narrative, or does it distract from the main point (ordering/discretization as controlled choices)?

## Working answer
Useful only if it yields a minimal, explicit computation that sharpens a claim already in the manuscript: e.g., “midpoint is the symmetric choice because it is the Stratonovich (chain-rule-preserving) discretization.” Otherwise it should remain an outlook sentence.

## Next check
Pick a multiplicative-noise model and compute the Itô correction term explicitly.
