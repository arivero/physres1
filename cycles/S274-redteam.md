## Failure modes
1. Confusing leading-order sign map with full orbit existence theorem.
2. Treating numerically near-zero coefficients as exact analytical equality.

## Mitigations
1. Keep "leading-order asymptotic" wording explicit.
2. Label equality as subleading-sensitive rather than exact neutral class.
