# B03 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim:** turning the minimal-length/GUP citation into an endorsement rather than a tracked comparison branch.
2. **Weak anchor:** citing an off-topic paper that does not actually state the Laplacian fundamental-solution scaling.
3. **Transcript creep:** accidentally using `conv_patched.md` as a bibliography entry.

## Mitigations
1. Cite minimal-length/GUP only as “open problem / comparison branch”.
2. Verify the chosen source explicitly states the scaling and the \(n=2\) caveat.
3. Keep transcript references confined to planning docs only.
