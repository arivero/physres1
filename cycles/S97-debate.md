## Hard question
Should the paper include a Section on delta potentials in 1D (bound state computation)?

**Decision**: No. The delta-objects satellite already treats point interactions as rank-one kernels (Section 4). Including a bound-state computation here would create redundancy. The summary table in Section 5 flags the issue and cross-references the delta-objects note. If a future cycle adds a computation, it should go to the delta-objects satellite where the half-density framework is already set up.
