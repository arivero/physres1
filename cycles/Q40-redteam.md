# Q40 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Intro density**: too many heuristics early reduces accessibility.
2. **Vagueness**: "compatibility" sounds like philosophy.
3. **Nonlocal promises**: readers expect full SR/GR and quantum gravity coverage.

## Mitigations
1. Keep heuristics short and ensure later sections deliver concrete derivations (already true for \(\hbar\) and RG; SR/GR are in dependent drafts).
2. Use precise limit statements (\(\hbar\to0\), \(c\to\infty\), \(G\to0\)).
3. Keep SR/GR details out of the cornerstone manuscript; point to dependent notes for extensions.
