# D02 Debate: What exactly is “indeterminate” in the action–angle claim?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
Do we claim a formal uncertainty relation \(\Delta L_z\,\Delta\phi\ge \hbar/2\), or do we stay with the safer Fourier/separation-of-variables witness?

## Decision
Stay with the safer witness:
- \(L_z\) eigenstate \(\Rightarrow\) \(|\psi|^2\) independent of \(\phi\),
- localization in \(\phi\) requires a broad superposition in \(m\) (Fourier).

## Rationale
It is explicit, self-contained, and does not depend on subtleties of angle operators.
