# S140 Plan: Huang-Yang pseudopotential

Date: 2026-02-13

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/fermionic-mediators-contact-limits/main.md` (potential)

## Scope
Study the Huang-Yang pseudopotential as a contact kernel with built-in regularization. The differential operator (∂/∂r)(r·) extracts the regular part at the origin, implementing the scattering-length boundary condition without explicit cutoff. Blackboard slot 1.
