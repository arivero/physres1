# D11 Plan: Post-promotion housekeeping (cycle board + log) and next-action selection

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Update the durable planning artifacts after the `S66 → C98 → Q55` chain and choose the next bounded action.

## Novelty candidates (shortlist)
1. `D12`: pick the next bounded novelty thread (spawn one concrete `S` deliverable).
2. `B12` (optional, time-capped): one more OA attempt for `[Dirac1933]`; otherwise keep `PENDING_LOCAL_PDF`.
3. `C99` (optional, bundle): small clarity polish in `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` (notation/formatting) as part of the next substantive promotion wave.

## Decision criteria
- Keep the cycle board and research log consistent with the actual repo state.
- Keep the next-action list short and deliverable-focused (avoid spawning micro `C` cycles).

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/D11-*.md`
- `cycles/index.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- None required (this is mainly planning/logging); queue `D12` and optional follow-ups in `cycles/index.md`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Cycle board updated to include `S66`, `C98`, `Q55`.
- Research log includes dated entries for `C98` and `Q55`.
- A clear “next action” list is set.
