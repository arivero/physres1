# Q51 Debate: Are the operator symbols too early in the reader map?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Does showing \(\mathcal C_t,\mathcal Q_\hbar,\mathcal R_\Lambda\) in Section 2.5 (before Appendix 10.3 defines them) create unnecessary notation friction?

## Recommendation
Keep the symbols (they connect directly to the later RCP summary), but consider a tiny “defined in Appendix 10.3” parenthetical if feedback suggests confusion.
