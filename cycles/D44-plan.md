# D44 Plan: RCP Foundations Paper Scoping

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
What is the minimal axiomatic content for a standalone "Refinement Compatibility Principle (RCP)" foundations paper?

## Context
- Cornerstone defines RCP in Appendix 10.3 (Proposition P10.1, ~50 lines)
- `docs/next-articles.md` item A lists deliverables: commuting diagrams, minimal axioms, worked examples
- Goal: upgrade RCP from "appendix principle" to "main theorem framework"

## Success criteria (mathematics in blackboard/notebook)
**Scope map** (not full paper):
1. **Formal definition:** Partition/representation/scale compatibility as commuting diagrams
2. **Minimal axiom list:** 3-5 axioms that recover cornerstone chain
3. **Worked examples:** Classical (Noether + weak EL), Quantum (ordering equivalence), RG (toy beta function)

**Output:** Blackboard note with:
- Commuting diagram template (partition, representation, scale)
- Axiom candidates (e.g., "predictions commute with refinement")
- One explicit example (preferably classical mechanics, simplest setting)

## Expected outcome
- D44 produces scope map → spawn S299 for worked example → spawn C319 for initial draft
- Target length: 6-9pp (PLB to low-PRD range)

## Permitted tools
- Blackboards (check slot availability)
- Notebooks if computation stabilizes
- Cornerstone Section 10.3 as source material

## Out of scope (this cycle)
- Full paper draft (that's C319)
- All three worked examples (pick one for S-cycle, add others in C-cycle)
- Heavy formalism (keep to "theorem-definition-example" level)
