# S43 Execution: Newton-Limit Obstruction Candidates

## Work Completed
- Enumerated concrete candidate failure modes of naive "refine \(\to 0\)" reasoning:
  - counterterm grammar already in derivatives,
  - ordering/discretization non-uniqueness,
  - non-existence of naive path-space measures,
  - singular probes requiring distributional regularization,
  - non-commutation issues in stationary-phase refinement.
- Tied each to existing loci in the repo and recorded a promotion candidate in:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-newton-limit-obstruction-candidates.md`.

## Result
Prepared a compact promotion target: add one labeled heuristic in `paper/main.md` enumerating the key obstructions and positioning quantization/renormalization as limit-control mechanisms.

## Next Spawn
- `C70`: promote the short heuristic list into `paper/main.md` near the Zeno-style motivation paragraph.
