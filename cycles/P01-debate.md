# P01 Debate: Should cadence block preflight cycles?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does the 7-day rule forbid P-cycle preflight work, or only actual submissions?

## Resolution
It should gate external submissions, not internal compile/readiness checks. Preflight is valid and useful for reducing submission risk.
