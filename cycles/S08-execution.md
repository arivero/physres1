# S08 Execution

## Work
- Wrote a multi-dimensional version of the “delta on the critical set” identity:
  - \(\delta^{(n)}(F(x))=\sum \delta^{(n)}(x-x_i)/|\det DF(x_i)|\) for nondegenerate zeros,
  - specialization \(F=\nabla f\Rightarrow\delta^{(n)}(\nabla f)=\sum \delta^{(n)}(x-x_i)/|\det(\mathrm{Hess}\,f)(x_i)|\).
- Compared with stationary phase in \(n\) dimensions to highlight the square-root determinant at the amplitude level.
- Recorded (as a structural template) why mixed Hessian determinants like Van Vleck’s arise after eliminating intermediate variables (Schur complements/Jacobi-field viewpoint).

## Result
- New note: `blackboards/2026-02-10-delta-gradient-and-van-vleck.md`.

## Status
Completed.
