# S141 Debate: Spin coherent states

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Spin coherent states are the direct SU(2) analog of Heisenberg-Weyl coherent states.
- |⟨J⟩| = jℏ (not √(j(j+1))ℏ) — this is the magnitude of the expectation vector, not the Casimir.
- Δθ ~ 1/√(2j) exactly; ~ notation in the remark is standard for scaling.
- Reviewer unanimously recommended Section 6 placement over Section 7.
