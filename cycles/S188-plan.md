# S188 Plan: Crossing Symmetry & Grassmann Obstruction (Fermionic Paper Sec 2)

## Objective
Study and blackboard the connection between crossing symmetry, Mandelstam channels, and Grassmann obstruction in fermionic scattering.

## Scope
- Crossing symmetry in S-matrix theory
- Mandelstam analyticity as assumption (not theorem)
- How Grassmann obstruction relates to channel kinematics
- Spinor sign conventions in fermion crossing

## Deliverable
Blackboard note (blackboards/0.md) on crossing symmetry, ready for promotion into Remark 2.2 of fermionic-mediators paper.
