# S98 Execution: N-impulse → path integral bridge for Dirac Probes
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
Drafted Section 4.5 content: N-impulse extension showing discrete action, classical stationarity recovering corner conditions, quantum sum yielding time-sliced path integral. Key insight: the half-density normalization prefactor (m/(2πiℏΔt))^{N/2} is required for composition at each junction.

Content ready for C140 promotion.
