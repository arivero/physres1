# C291 Debate: Is a chart-level benchmark enough for Package B?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does adding a chart-level curved-manifold symmetry benchmark sufficiently close Package B for the main paper stage, or is full extension theory required now?

## Options
1. Require full extension theory now.
2. Promote chart-level benchmark now and defer full extension theory.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
Package B needs a concrete operator-domain witness in curved setting; full extension theory would be disproportionate for this review stage and can be deferred as an explicit future hardening task.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Next optional hardening: dedicated S/C pair on self-adjoint extension classification for singular coefficients.
