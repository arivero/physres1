# S271 Plan: Threshold-bridge sanity grid and wording lock

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Stress-test the threshold bridge with a minimal numeric asymptotic grid and finalize compact wording for promotion.

## Deliverable
- Target: one short note with sign/regime grid for representative Newton/SR cases.
- Output file:
  - `paper/notes/main-paper-threshold-bridge-sanity-grid.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S271-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Numeric witness cleanly matches the exponent-inequality logic.
- Promotion wording finalized in <=3 sentences.
- Command and output summary recorded.
