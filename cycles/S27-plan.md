# S27 Plan: SR Continuation of the Planck-Areal-Speed Witness

## Goal
Test whether the SR circular-orbit stability wave (`S26`) yields a clean continuation of the Planck-areal-speed witness (currently Newtonian/inverse-square in `papers/planck-area/main.md`).

## Scope
1. Work in the same mechanical SR central-force model used in `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`.
2. Impose fixed coordinate-time areal speed \(\dot A_0=dA/dt\), derive \(q=2\) closed formulas.
3. Check whether any robust link survives beyond inverse-square (\(q\neq2\)).

## Acceptance Tests
- Derive an explicit \(r(M,\dot A_0)\) formula for gravitational \(q=2\).
- Verify low-speed and high-speed limits and interpret relation to Compton/Planck scales.
- Record whether the \(q\neq2\) branch gives a clean promotable statement or only a weak bound.
