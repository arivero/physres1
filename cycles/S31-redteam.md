# S31 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Model lock-in:** claiming source-anchored \(U^\mu\) is universally minimal in all contexts.
2. **Terminology blur:** mixing covariance with observer-independence.
3. **Hidden assumptions:** central-source setup not stated when asserting minimality.

## Mitigations
1. Scope the claim to the current central-force/source branch.
2. Use explicit phrase “covariant relative to chosen \(u^\mu\)”.
3. Keep assumptions explicit in both blackboard and promoted manuscript remark.
