# S14 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Work
1. Added `blackboards/2026-02-10-hbar-as-action-scale-and-kernel-normalization.md`:
   - dimensionless exponent forces an action scale (\(\hbar\)),
   - stationary phase: \(\hbar\) as the small parameter selecting extremals,
   - short-time kernel: delta-normalized composition forces \(\hbar\) into the prefactor \( (m/2\pi i\hbar t)^{d/2}\).

## Result
We now have a quantization-facing (non-BV) support note explaining why an \(\hbar\)-like action scale is structurally required once we demand oscillatory action weights and composable, delta-normalized kernels.
