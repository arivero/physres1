# D18 Plan: Deepen threshold-bridge research with explicit back-and-forth

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Slow down the central-force threshold thread and run a two-stage stress test before any additional manuscript promotion.

## Why this cycle
Recent promotion (`C299`) inserted a compact bridge remark quickly. To improve research rigor, we now require explicit objection-response passes and scope sharpening in study artifacts.

## Research questions
1. How does coefficient dependence modify the naive marginal condition at \(q=\nu+1\)?
2. Which assumptions are load-bearing (power-law attraction, fixed \(L\), single asymptotic kinetic degree), and how does failure of each assumption break the rule?
3. What is the smallest safe statement for future manuscript use?

## Chosen target
- Build a two-note stress-test package by extending existing notes:
  - `paper/notes/main-paper-threshold-bridge.md` (analytic backbone + coefficient-aware marginal criterion).
  - `paper/notes/main-paper-threshold-bridge-sanity-grid.md` (counterexample-oriented sanity grid and assumption-break tests).

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/D18-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- `S272`: coefficient-aware threshold/marginal analysis.
- `S273`: assumption-break stress tests (non-power-law and mixed kinetic asymptotics).
- Optional later `C300` only if the refined statement materially improves manuscript precision.

## Acceptance criteria
- Explicit objection-response structure is documented in study outputs.
- No manuscript edits in this cycle.
