# Dxx Red Team: <discovery risks>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Failure modes
- “Novelty” is only renaming:
  - Mitigation: require a concrete witness (spawn `S`).
- Claim depends on transcript/preprint phrasing:
  - Mitigation: rewrite derivation-first in our own words; treat preprints as heuristic.
- Hidden bibliography debt:
  - Mitigation: if promoted into manuscripts, spawn `B` for an independent anchor.
