# S21 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Dimension confusion:** mixing spatial \(n\) and spacetime \(D\), or applying the 4D Planck-length identity \(L_P^2=G\hbar/c^3\) outside its domain without flagging it.
2. **Overclaiming:** implying “\(q=2\) special” proves the half-density scale hypothesis, rather than being one compatible witness.
3. **Hidden conventions:** using areal speed without stating \(\dot A = \tfrac12 r v\) (circular) or \(\dot A = L/(2m)\) (general planar).

## Mitigations
1. State clearly which step uses \(D=4\) (the Planck-length identity) and keep the rest purely kinematical.
2. Frame results as: “witness / compatibility check” for the universal-area hypothesis ladder.
3. Keep the derivation fully explicit and boxed.
