# C36 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Changes
1. `papers/half-density-qft/main.md`
   - Softened the abstract phrasing about counterterms/contact terms to “diagonal-supported distributions”.
   - Added an explicit one-line dictionary between the scalar Green function \(G_g\) (paired with \(\sqrt{|g|}\,d^Dx\)) and the half-density Green kernel \(\widetilde G\) (paired with \(d^Dx\)): \(\widetilde G=|g|^{1/4}G_g|g|^{1/4}\).
