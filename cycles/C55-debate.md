# C55 Debate: Does the Caveat Weaken the Core Witness?

## Question
By adding clock-choice sensitivity, do we undermine the usefulness of D1.5b?

## Current Resolution
No; it sharpens the claim:
- robust part: low-mass Compton-like branch is shared;
- sensitive part: high-mass asymptotic depends on whether \(dA/dt\) or \(dA/d\tau\) is fixed.
This improves falsifiability and avoids overclaiming.
