# S79 Debate: Is the parity obstruction a deep fact or an artifact of integer dimensions?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The parity obstruction (odd d → no integer-dimensional monomial matches length^{d/2}) relies on d being an integer. In dimensional regularization, d is treated as continuous. Does the obstruction have physical content or is it an artifact of restricting to integer d?

## Recommendation
The obstruction has genuine content within the PA-H2.5a framework. The integrality sieve is explicitly about integer d (physical spacetime dimensions) and integer exponents in coupling monomials. Dimensional regularization treats d as continuous for intermediate calculations but physical predictions are evaluated at integer d. The parity obstruction says: among physical integer dimensions, odd ones are categorically excluded by the integrality sieve with standard couplings. This is a meaningful structural statement within the hypothesis ladder, not an artifact. No change to the blackboard needed.
