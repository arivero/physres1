## Hard question
Is the effective-potential argument for all bound orbits genuinely new content for the satellite, or is it standard?

**Decision**: The result is standard (it follows from the relativistic effective potential, which is textbook material), but the presentation — emphasizing the critical-exponent shift from q=3 to q=2 — is a structural insight aligned with the project's theme. The satellite paper benefits from covering both circular and bound orbits.
