# C34 Debate

## Question
In QFT, is the half-density priority best presented as:
1) a **spacetime** statement (propagators/kernels on a manifold), or
2) a **field-space** statement (BV half-densities, measure/gauge fixing), or
3) both?

## Working Resolution
Wave 1 will be spacetime-first and computable (densitized scalar field + kernel semantics).
Field-space/BV appears only as an outlook paragraph, explicitly heuristic until anchored by independent references.
