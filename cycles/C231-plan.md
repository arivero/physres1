# C231 Plan: Promote Remark 1.2 into uncuttable paper

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Promote corrected Zeno blackboard into uncuttable paper as Remark 1.2.

## Target manuscripts (must edit ≥1)
- `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Remark 1.2 after Remark 1.1 (etymological "atomos" discussion), before Section 2
- Remark: Zeno's paradoxes as proto-refinement limits

Out of scope:
- Bibliography edits (no new entries needed; historical refs are context, not load-bearing claims)

## Minimum promotion bar
This remark adds ~9 lines of historical framing to Section 1, creating a bridge from etymology to modern toy models in Section 2.

## Allowed files
- `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md`
- `cycles/C231-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`, `docs/`
