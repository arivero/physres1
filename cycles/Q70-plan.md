# Q70 Plan: Referee pass on C115 (Remark PA-E5a)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C115`: Promote S77 three-level RG hierarchy into Planck-area draft as Remark PA-E5a

## Goal
Referee-pass the C115 manuscript changes for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q70-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: theorem vs heuristic labels match content.
- Notation: consistent, no dimension mixups (`d` vs `D`).
- Citations: load-bearing claims are anchored or explicitly marked `PENDING` for a future `B`.
- Reader flow: one-screen sanity check (intro paragraph and transitions).
- Cross-references: verify D6.2a-sg, P6.2, PA-H2.3–PA-H2.4, PA-H2.5, PA-D1.3 all exist and match.

## Acceptance criteria
- A concrete list of edits to do next, expressed as spawned `S/B/C/D` cycles (not direct edits).
