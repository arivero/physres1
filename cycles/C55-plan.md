# C55 Plan: Promote Clock-Choice Caveat into Planck-Area Draft

## Goal
Promote the S28 convention-sensitivity result into `papers/planck-area/main.md` as a short follow-up remark near D1.5b.

## Scope
- Add one compact remark contrasting fixed \(dA/dt\) and fixed \(dA/d\tau\) branches.
- Keep core claim narrow: low-mass branch robust, high-mass asymptotic convention-sensitive.

## Acceptance Tests
- Include proper-time branch formula and its domain.
- Include \(\dot A_\tau=cL_P\) specialization and endpoint behavior.
- Record diffstat in `cycles/C55-execution.md` via `scripts/paper-diffstat.sh --cached`.
