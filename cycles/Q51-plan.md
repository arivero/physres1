# Q51 Plan: Referee pass on C94 reader map insertion

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C94`: add compatibility reader map

## Goal
Referee-pass the C94 manuscript change for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience (does it orient without distracting?).

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q51-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Reader map is clearly labeled as navigation (not a new thesis paragraph).
- No new claims or citations are introduced.
- Notation is consistent with Appendix 10.3 (\(\mathcal C_t,\mathcal Q_\hbar,\mathcal R_\Lambda\)).
- PDF readability: no wide tables / no long lines.

## Acceptance criteria
- A concrete list of follow-ups expressed as spawned cycles (if needed).
