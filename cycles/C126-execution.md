# C126 Execution: Fix supplementary material reference

Date: 2026-02-13

## What changed
- Line 112: replaced "collected in the supplementary material" with "collected in the convention map (Section 5.9)".
- Also changed "1D/2D/3D" to "2D and 3D" since the 1D loop integral is not given explicitly (1D contact interactions don't need a UV-divergent loop integral in this paper's treatment).
