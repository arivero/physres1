# C71 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Convention clash:** confusion about \(G=c=1\) and the meaning of \(E,L\).
2. **Derivation density:** subsection becomes too long for a "baseline."
3. **Misuse risk:** readers treat external-potential SR witnesses and GR geodesics as directly comparable dynamics.

## Mitigations
1. Keep conventions explicit and reuse existing Section 4 definitions.
2. Keep formulas compact and focus on the stability criterion.
3. Retain the note's framing: these are refinement-witnesses, not a unified interaction model.
