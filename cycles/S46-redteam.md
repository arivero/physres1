# S46 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **History creep:** term drags historical claims into core physics argument.
2. **Misread indivisibility:** readers interpret "uncuttable" as atomic minimal chunks.
3. **Terminology lock-in:** we become dependent on one word rather than the underlying concept.

## Mitigations
1. Keep promoted content non-historical and math-first.
2. Define explicitly: "uncuttable = not computable from finite cuts without a limit rule."
3. Use the term sparingly; prioritize "controlled refinement/limit comparison" wording.
