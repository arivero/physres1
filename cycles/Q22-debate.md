# Q22 Debate: Is D1.5h Better in Open Problems?

## Question
Should the non-planar caution be moved to the Open Problems list instead of the main D1.5 chain?

## Current Resolution
Keep it in-chain:
- it directly constrains interpretation of adjacent formulas;
- moving it out risks readers applying scalar formulas outside their domain.
