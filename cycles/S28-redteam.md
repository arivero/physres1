# S28 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Clock ambiguity hidden:** treating \(dA/dt\) and \(dA/d\tau\) as interchangeable.
2. **False universality:** presenting the \(2L_P\) floor as invariant despite convention dependence.
3. **Model confusion:** forgetting both branches live in mechanical SR + external force assumptions.

## Mitigations
1. Put both formulas side by side in the study note.
2. Promote a caveat remark that separates robust (low-mass) from convention-sensitive (high-mass) conclusions.
3. Keep GR/QFT claims out of this branch unless separately derived.
