# Q05 Debate

## Question
Does the delta-objects draft need an explicit “distribution toolbox” subsection (δ, δ′, δ(f), δ(f′)) inside the paper, or is it better to keep that in `blackboards/` and only cite/point to it?

## Working Resolution
Keep only the minimal in-paper clarification needed to prevent conflation (already added as §3.1a + §3.4).
If more is needed, prefer pointing to the dedicated toolbox note rather than growing the synthesis draft.
