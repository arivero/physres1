# B13 Debate: Should the Pourciau–Nauenberg debate be cited in the manuscript?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The manuscript's Section 3 formalizes Newton's polygonal impulse → continuous orbit limit and hedges with "whenever the limit exists." Should we cite the scholarly debate?

## Decision
Yes — add at least Nauenberg (2003, arXiv math/0112048) as a positive anchor, and optionally Pourciau (2003) for the critical side. Defer to a C cycle.

## Rationale
1. The manuscript's thesis is that "refinement → limit" is the structural spine from Newton to the path integral. The very first instance of this refinement (Section 3) has a well-documented scholarly controversy about its rigor.
2. Ignoring this debate while building the entire paper on it would be a referee-visible gap.
3. Nauenberg's defence via Lemma 3 is the most manuscript-compatible anchor: it shows the limit IS well-defined.
4. Nauenberg's observation that the impulse map is symplectic/canonical connects naturally to the later composition and half-density themes.
