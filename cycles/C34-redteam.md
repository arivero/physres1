## Failure Modes
1. Treating functional-integral measures as rigorous theorems instead of a computational formalism.
2. Mixing “densitize by \(|g|^{1/4}\)” (a representation choice on a fixed background) with the stronger background-free universal scale claim (Planck-area program).
3. Writing “contact terms” in a way that implicitly assumes a specific regularization/renormalization scheme.

## Mitigations
- Keep the core content finite and explicit (densitized scalar field + kernel identities).
- Label all universality claims as conditional and point to `papers/planck-area/main.md` for the hypothesis ladder.
- Phrase contact/counterterm remarks at the kernel level (diagonal \(\delta(x-y)\) pieces and derivatives), and keep scheme dependence explicit.
