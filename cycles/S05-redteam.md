## Failure Modes
1. Treating a kernel on half-densities as an actual “square root” of a distribution (category error).
2. Mixing geometric density weights with RG anomalous dimensions (already a known confusion point).
3. Producing a note that is too abstract and has no concrete scaling computation.

## Mitigations
- State everything as operator/kernel identities and as coordinate-scaling checks.
- Keep the one computation explicit: \(y=x+\varepsilon v\) scaling produces \(\varepsilon^{-d/2}\).
- End with promotion candidates written as short, transplantable paragraphs.
