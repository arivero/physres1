## Goal
Add Remark 3.3 (Trotter product formula) to the uncuttable satellite. The Trotter formula e^{t(A+B)} = lim_{N→∞}(e^{tA/N}e^{tB/N})^N is the mathematical theorem that makes the path integral's refinement-limit character rigorous. It directly instantiates the "uncuttable" pattern: the exact propagator is a limit of finite compositions, and convergence requires control of the operator splitting.
