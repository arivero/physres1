## Scope
Review the three most recent satellite additions from S119–S121 / C160–C162:
1. Remark 4.2 (fermionic mediators): ERE↔contact connection
2. Remark 2.3 (uncuttable): Euler–Maclaurin correction tower
3. Remark 4.4 (action-angle): von Mises near-optimal state

## Method
Fresh-context subagent reads all three satellites cold and verifies every mathematical claim.
