# C04 Debate

## Claim
Propagator composition should be the starting postulate for the path-integral construction in this paper.

## Objection
For explicitly time-dependent generators, naive semigroup notation can hide time-ordering subtleties.

## Resolution
Keep the composition statement interval-local and interpret slicing as ordered in time; this is sufficient for the manuscript's scope.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Additive discrete action plus multiplicative slice composition implies an exponential action weight.

## Objection
The constant in the exponent is underdetermined, so the argument may look circular if \(i/\hbar\) is inserted too early.

## Resolution
State a generic constant \(c_0\) with action-inverse dimensions, then specialize to \(i/\hbar\) only when unitary oscillatory evolution is chosen.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Stationary phase explains classical recovery in the small-\(\hbar\) regime.

## Objection
Stationary-phase arguments require nondegeneracy assumptions and can fail near caustics/zero modes.

## Resolution
Keep the statement asymptotic and local; do not claim a global constructive measure result.

## Status
Accepted with caveat.

## Claim
`C03` corner and impulse matching conditions should feed directly into semiclassical extremals in `C04`.

## Objection
Including broken trajectories in formal path integration can overstate mathematical control.

## Resolution
Limit the claim to classical skeleton admissibility: broken trajectories are allowed only when they satisfy the derived jump/matching laws.

## Status
Accepted.
