# Q66 Red Team: What could go wrong?

## Failure modes

- **"P9.1 says O(ℏ) corrections but D9.1a shows O(ℏ²) too"**
  - Response: P9.1 means "corrections that vanish as ℏ→0." Both O(ℏ) and O(ℏ²) terms vanish. The statement is correct as written. No change needed.

- **"The Weyl ordering formula for fp² might differ from the 'totally symmetric' prescription in some conventions"**
  - Response: for symbols of the form f(q)p^n with f depending only on q, Weyl ordering coincides with totally symmetric ordering. This is because the Weyl transform of f(q)p^n evaluated at the midpoint gives the same result as the symmetric average ¼(fp̂² + 2p̂fp̂ + p̂²f). No convention ambiguity for this symbol type.

- **"The half-density resolution claim might be unclear to readers unfamiliar with the companion note"**
  - Response: the claim is self-contained within the remark — it states what the conjugation does without requiring the reader to look up HD-D1.3. The cross-reference is supplementary.
