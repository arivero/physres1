# Q44 Debate: Does Mentioning Vacuum Energy Invite a Detour?

## Question
Does even a short disclaimer about vacuum energy pull the reader into QFT/GR tangents?

## Current Resolution
Keep it to one sentence that prevents overgeneralization, with no additional discussion.
If it becomes distracting, move it to Section 8.6 "boundaries audit" later.
