# Q20 Debate: Is D1.5f Better as a Numbered Axiom?

## Question
Should the “minimal timelike-structure rule” be elevated to a formal axiom in the paper?

## Current Resolution
Not yet:
- current evidence supports it as a branch-level operational rule;
- formal axiom status should wait for non-circular and non-central tests.
