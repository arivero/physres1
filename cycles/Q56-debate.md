# Q56 Debate: referee pass on C99 step-doubling notation + modified equation display

Date: 2026-02-11

## Hard question
Does introducing bracket notation \(f'(y)[v]\) (even briefly) undermine the “quick witness” goal of the section?

## Current resolution
No: it appears once, immediately resolves the only ambiguous shorthand, and then the computation remains short. The reader cost is smaller than the confusion cost of \(f'(f)\) without an explicit definition.
