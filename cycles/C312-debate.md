# C312 Debate

## Hard question
Is the hypothesis reduction (4 -> 3) overstated? Specifically, does the Levy obstruction truly close the loophole, or are there non-Levy non-Gaussian processes that could satisfy (C)+(I)+(D)?

## Resolution
The argument is tight for the stated setup: among infinitely divisible distributions satisfying (C)+(I)+(D) with parameters from {m, hbar}, the Levy-Khintchine representation is exhaustive. The dimensional obstruction alpha=2 is algebraic (two-line proof from matching M, L, T exponents). The only remaining freedom is within Gaussian kernels (different covariance structures), which is already handled by (D). The claim is appropriately scoped: "for kernels with parameters built from {m, hbar}" -- if one allows additional fundamental constants, the argument changes (but so does the physics).

The correction to D9.1a is factual: S294 showed both Weyl and half-density share the connection term f'dq. The prior claim was wrong and the correction strengthens the paper (deformation equivalence is physical, not just formal).
