# C188 Debate: Lattice gauge theory promotion

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Remark fits naturally after dim reg (Remark 4.2) as the non-perturbative complement.
- Exact gauge invariance at every lattice spacing provides a strong parallel with symplectic integrators (Remark 3.4).
- Confinement/mass gap framing connects the "uncuttable" theme to the deepest open problem in QFT.
