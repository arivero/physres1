# Q81 Debate

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is 7 pages / 5 references enough for a Tier 1 (READY) paper?

## Resolution
Yes. The paper is intentionally narrow (stated in Section 1). Its value is making one concrete point (half-density kernels in QFT, not just QM) with one worked computation (densitized scalar field) and one structural observation (contact terms as diagonal delta kernels). The 5 references anchor the key claims. Length is proportional to content — padding would dilute the message.
