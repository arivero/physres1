# C53 Redteam: Failure Modes for Promotion

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaiming:** presenting the stability criterion as fully relativistic (field-theoretic) rather than mechanical SR with a scalar potential.
2. **Notation collision:** confusing \(L\) (angular momentum) with the Lagrangian \(L\), or mixing units/conventions.
3. **Shallow promotion:** copying formulas without the minimal derivation steps needed for reader trust.

## Mitigations
1. Add an explicit scope sentence and keep the derivation self-contained.
2. Use “\(L\)” for angular momentum but refer to the Lagrangian explicitly as “Lagrangian”; keep units visible (\(c\)).
3. Include the key steps: define \(W_L\), state \(W_L'(r_0)=0\), compute \(W_L''(r_0)\), interpret inequality.
