# S298 Execution: 2D Delta Interaction RG Example (Rooted-Tree Adaptation)

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent: D42

## What was computed
Extracted and adapted cornerstone Section 10.5 (2D delta interaction) for rooted-tree paper context.

## Key content (167 lines in blackboard slot 1)
1. **Setup:** 2D contact Hamiltonian, logarithmic divergence
2. **Tree structure:** One-loop = \(\tau_1 = \bullet\) (single node, no nested subdivergences)
3. **Counterterm formula:** Explicit \(1/g_R(\mu)\) subtraction
4. **Beta function:** \(\beta(g_R) = (m/\pi\hbar^2) g_R^2\)
5. **Dimensional transmutation:** RG-invariant scale \(\kappa_*\)
6. **Scheme dependence:** Finite shift \(C\) → rescaling \(\kappa_*^{(C)} = e^{C/2} \kappa_*\)
7. **Butcher parallel (Section 8):** Explicit comparison table

**Critical parallels to midpoint RK:**
- Both: single-node tree \(\tau_1 = \bullet\)
- Both: composition law (step/scale doubling)
- Both: free parameter (h / μ)
- Both: scheme/method freedom fixed by one physical datum

## Verdict
Ready for C316 promotion to rooted-tree paper Section 4.4 (~1-1.5pp expansion)

## Blackboard location
Slot 1 (supersedes previous D29/S288 content, which was already promoted to notebook)
