# S20 Plan: Map `conv_patched.md` Topics to Current Papers (Coverage + Incorporation Targets)

## Goal
Identify which ideas/themes in `conv_patched.md` are:
1) already incorporated into the current paper set,
2) only partially incorporated,
3) still outside the scope of existing drafts,
and record a concrete “where to incorporate” map (file + suggested section) that survives restarts.

## Scope
- Read `conv_patched.md` as a non-citable idea log.
- Produce one durable mapping document in `docs/`:
  - topics -> current coverage -> proposed incorporation location -> needed cycle type (`S`/`C`/`B`).
- Update the roadmap (`docs/next-articles.md`) only if new follow-up-paper candidates are clearly identified.

## Acceptance Tests
1. A new `docs/conv-coverage-map.md` exists with a gap/placement map.
2. The map flags any items requiring bibliography anchoring as `B` tasks (no transcript-citation leakage).
3. `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md` reflect completion of S20.
