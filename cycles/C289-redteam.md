# C289 Redteam

## Failure modes
1. Added technical blocks may feel disconnected from the manuscript narrative.
2. One-loop QFT witness may become notation-inconsistent with Section 8 conventions.
3. Regulated-kernel witness may overstate what is proved about path integrals.
4. Package renaming could create editorial churn without content gain.

## Mitigations
1. Anchor each new block explicitly to the relevant residual vulnerability and package target.
2. Reuse existing symbols (`g_R`, `\mu`, `\Lambda`, `\beta`) and tie to Section 8 equations.
3. State clearly that the kernel witness is a controlled model, not a full constructive measure theory.
4. Rename while simultaneously adding derivations so the edit is technically productive.
