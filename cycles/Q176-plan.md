# Q176 Plan: Referee pass on C293 quantitative Package A bounds

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C293`: Package A quantitative error-control extension (`P12.2`)

## Goal
Referee-pass the new bounded-potential error/composition-defect bounds for correctness and scope.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q176-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `notebooks/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Bound structure is internally consistent with Duhamel expansion assumptions.
- Constants/orders are conservative and not overstated.
- Package A status line matches new content.

## Acceptance criteria
- PASS/FAIL and explicit next-cycle recommendation.
