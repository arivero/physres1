# C35 Plan

## Goal
Tighten `papers/delta-objects/main.md` in response to the recurring “which delta?” ambiguity:
1. explicitly distinguish \(\delta(f')\) (stationary-set localization) from \(\delta'\) (derivative-of-delta probing derivatives at a point),
2. connect “extremal conditions” to the weak Euler–Lagrange statement (distributional equality), highlighting how corner/jump terms appear as deltas.

## Scope
1. Edit `papers/delta-objects/main.md` (small additions only; keep it concise).
2. Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Non-Goals
- No new bibliography ingestion.
- No edits to `paper/main.md` in this cycle.

## Acceptance Tests
1. The draft contains a short explicit \(\delta(f')\) vs \(\delta'\) clarification with formulas.
2. The draft contains a brief weak Euler–Lagrange remark explaining where \(\delta\)/\(\delta'\) enter when taking extremals with corners/impulses.
