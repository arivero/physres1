# DX11 Plan: Cross-thread probe (relativistic-orbit thresholds vs RCP framing)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Run one focused exploratory pass to test whether the new threshold rule changes the principle framing or anomaly register.

## Surprise inventory
- Recent S265 found two distinct mechanisms behind \(q=2\) specialness (asymptotic vs dimensional).

## Cross-thread probe
- Threads: relativistic-central-orbits + RCP/ordering framing.
- Expected connection: both involve classifying what survives under refinement and what is representation-dependent.

## Framing stress-test
- Hard case: if two mechanisms coincide numerically (at SR \(q=2\)) but are structurally independent, does RCP framing stay precise?

## Candidate principle
- Candidate: no new principle; refine existing language to separate mechanism classes.

## Acceptance criteria
- Fill all required DX sections.
- Update `docs/anomalies.md` with this pass.
- Confirm whether principle evolution log needs a new version bump.
