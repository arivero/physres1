## Failure modes
1. Cross-references could make the cornerstone feel dependent on companions. Mitigated by keeping them parenthetical and supplementary (cf.), not load-bearing.
2. Label stability: if the satellite is revised, RG-D1.2a/RG-D1.7 labels could move. Low risk — the labeling convention is stable.
