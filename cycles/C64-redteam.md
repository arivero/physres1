# C64 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Threshold absolutism:** users treat “few-percent” as universal law.
2. **Underspecified discrepancy metric:** unclear whether comparing std, mean bias, or quantiles.
3. **Method ambiguity:** nonlinear method choice not specified.

## Mitigations
1. Keep trigger explicitly pragmatic, not fundamental.
2. Default to std-comparison language in nearby text.
3. Leave method choice open but suggest Monte Carlo as baseline.
