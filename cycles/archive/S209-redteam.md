## Failure mode 1: Remark too close to Remark 4.2
The content overlaps with the last sentence of 4.2.

**Mitigation**: 4.3 is an explicit elaboration, not a repetition.
The integral formula and convergence condition are new content.

## Failure mode 2: Missing factors
The formula "Γ(1-d/2)κ^{d-2}" omits (2π)^{-d/2} and m,ℏ factors.

**Mitigation**: Remark says "up to constants." The structural point
(exponent and convergence) is independent of constant prefactors.
