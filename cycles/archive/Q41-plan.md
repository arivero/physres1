# Q41 Plan: Quality Pass on Scale-Supplier Branch (Example E4 / Remark E4a)

## Goal
Referee-style check of `papers/planck-area/main.md` around:
- `Example E4`,
- `Remark E4a`,
to ensure the string-tension option is:
- operationally defined,
- hypothesis-separated (UV area parameter vs transmutation),
- and not overclaimed.

## Checks
1. Read the local flow from `Example E4` through `Heuristic H2.13`.
2. Verify `Remark E4a` includes the Wilson-loop definition and is properly cited.
3. Confirm no cycle labels leaked into manuscript prose.

## Acceptance Tests
- No edits required, or spawn a focused `C` cycle to tighten wording.
