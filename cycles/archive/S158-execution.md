# S158 Execution: Geometric quantization

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 0 on geometric quantization.
2. Reviewed by mathematical physicist: Souriau date 1970 not 1966; real polarization → Fock states only for action polarization (not generic real polarization); symplectic form on S² self-consistent; BKS theorem and metaplectic correction correct.
3. Corrections: fixed Souriau date, specified "action polarization" in promoted remark, used "proportional to area form" for S² symplectic form.
