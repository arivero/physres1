# C288 Redteam

Date: 2026-02-14

## Failure modes
1. The rewritten Section 9 may read like internal project management rather than scientific narrative.
2. Work packages may overpromise beyond what current derivations support.
3. Edits may add volume without increasing technical precision.

## Mitigations
1. Keep language anchored to derivations, witnesses, and falsifiable closure criteria.
2. Frame packages as explicit scope-bounded extensions of stated vulnerabilities.
3. Replace generic text rather than only appending, so added lines carry concrete technical content.
