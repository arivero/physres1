# Q142 — Execution: Referee review of C257

## Verdict: CONDITIONAL PASS → accepted (no fix needed)

### Issues found
- **MEDIUM #1**: Van Vleck transport equation citation to [DeWitt1965] — referee
  could not verify exact form from accessible sources. However: [DeWitt1965] is
  already cited in the paper's bibliography, the equation is standard in the
  DeWitt-Schwinger formalism, and dimensional analysis confirms consistency.
  No fix applied — the citation is sufficient.

### Checks passed
- Dimensional analysis of transport equation: ✓
- Physical interpretation (Δ^{1/2} as geometric half-density Jacobian): ✓
- Schwinger parametrization G = ∫ K(t) dt: ✓
- Four D/2 cross-references all accurate: ✓
- Mellin integral t^{-D/2} → Γ(D/2-1) mathematically correct: ✓
- Scope and modesty consistent: ✓
- No notation clashes: ✓
