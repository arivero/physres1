## Failure modes
1. The HO example could make the paper feel like a "collection of examples" without deeper analysis. Mitigated by keeping it brief (one worked example as a bridge to the Outlook).
2. Could distract from the paper's central focus on central potentials. Mitigated by framing it as "simplest witness beyond the circle."
