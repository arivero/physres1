# B15 Red Team: bibliography entry risks

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes
- **Citation is ornamental:**
  - Mitigation: see B15-debate. The connection is substantive for the introduction's framing.
- **Scope creep into history of mathematics:**
  - Mitigation: the C cycle that uses this citation should be limited to one sentence in Section 1 or 3.1. Do not write a history-of-math section.
- **No DOI or modern edition:**
  - Mitigation: the work is in the public domain (1734). OA via Wikisource and Internet Archive. No DOI is expected for 18th-century sources (same as [Newton1687]).
