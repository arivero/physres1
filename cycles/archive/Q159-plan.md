# Q159 Plan

Referee review of Remark HD-D4.2a (Trace anomaly and index theorem from a_{D/2}).

Check: (1) a_n(x,x) is local curvature polynomial claim in even D=2n; (2) trace anomaly ⟨T^μ_μ⟩ ∝ a_{D/2} (Vassilevich ref); (3) Atiyah-Singer index via McKean-Singer supertrace; (4) half-density coordinate-free trace claim; (5) consistency with Remark HD-D4.2 and Seeley-DeWitt expansion context; (6) citation present.
