# Q09 Redteam: Remaining Risks After Adding H2.6a

## Risks
1. Readers may conflate the new operator-simplicity filter with the coupling sieve (H2.5).
2. The “scalarization gauge” phrasing may be misread as a gauge symmetry rather than a representational choice.
3. The conformal restriction might be forgotten later when promoted into broader narratives.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the explicit contrast sentence (“independent of H2.5”) in H2.6a.
2. When referencing later, prefer “scalarization convention” over “gauge” unless explicitly defining the term.
3. If promoted further, add a short follow-up S-cycle to test beyond the conformal class (or to derive an invariant statement).
