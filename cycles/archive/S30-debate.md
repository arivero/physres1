# S30 Debate: Is “Need a Timelike Direction” a Bug or a Feature?

## Question
Does requiring a timelike direction \(U^\mu\) mean the approach is fundamentally non-covariant?

## Current Resolution
It is a feature of the observable being modeled:
- “areal speed” is a spatially interpreted quantity and inherently tied to a slicing/observer choice;
- covariance is preserved by expressing results in terms of \(U^\mu\) covariantly, not by pretending no such structure is needed.
