## Fixed errors
1. Sign in E-M formula: verified by direct substitution (f(x)=x on [0,1]) and independent subagent confirmation.
2. Simpson's claim: confirmed incorrect by structural argument (Simpson's uses interior evaluations, not endpoint derivatives).

## Residual risk
None. The corrected formula matches standard references (NIST DLMF, Kress numerical analysis). The explicit B_j values prevent future sign-convention ambiguity.
