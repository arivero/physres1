# S139 Plan: Real spherical harmonics as angle-localization witness

Date: 2026-02-13

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md` (potential)

## Scope
Study real spherical harmonics (p_x, p_y, d_{xy}) as minimal illustration of the Fourier tradeoff. Superposing m and -m breaks azimuthal uniformity to create directional lobes. Blackboard slot 0.
