# Q173 Execution: Referee pass on C290 Package B closure

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C290`

## Findings
- PASS.
- `Derivation D9.1b` is mathematically coherent on the stated domain `H^1_per(S^1)`:
  - adjoint-difference formula for `Q_L` is correct;
  - cancellation in `Q_W` is correctly shown.
- `Remark D9.1c` correctly prevents overclaiming by separating symmetry-on-domain from full self-adjoint extension theory.
- Section 9.5 Package B status line accurately reflects partial closure (starter done, curved-manifold extension pending).

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- `C291` (optional, when bandwidth permits): extend Package B from periodic `S^1` witness to one curved-manifold kinetic example with explicit domain assumptions.

## Notes (non-actions)
- The main manuscript now has concrete starter closures across Packages A/C/D/E and a scoped closure for B.
