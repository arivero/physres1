# Q51 Execution: Referee pass on C94 reader map insertion

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C94`

## Findings
- Placement is appropriate: the block appears exactly at the Section 2.5 → Section 3 transition, when readers benefit most from a “map” before entering the Newton refinement chain.
- Scope/claim hygiene is good: the block is purely navigational (“where to look”) and does not introduce new claims or citations.
- Notation consistency is good: the operator symbols match Appendix 10.3, and the Appendix 10.3 bridge bullets were aligned accordingly.
- Minor potential confusion: the symbols \(\mathcal C_t,\mathcal Q_\hbar,\mathcal R_\Lambda\) appear before they are defined (definition is in Appendix 10.3). This is probably acceptable in a navigation block, but a short “defined in Appendix 10.3” parenthetical could reduce friction.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- None required.

## Optional follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- `C95` (optional): add a short parenthetical “symbols defined in Appendix 10.3” in the reader map header line, if reader tests suggest the early symbols distract.
