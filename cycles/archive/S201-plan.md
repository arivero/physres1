## Goal
Study the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem as the physical origin of
the contact expansion in fermionic paper Section 4.

## Scope
- Write blackboard 1 with heavy-mediator decoupling content
- Target: Remark 4.6 in fermionic paper
- Spawn subagent reviewer (per S-cycle blackboard strategy)

## Status
Completed (previous session; cycle files recreated after context loss).
