# S56 Execution: Wilson Loop Area Law as an Area-Scale Supplier (\(\sigma^{-1}\))

## Work
- Wrote a study note summarizing the Wilson-loop potential definition and area-law/string-tension criterion, and mapped it to the half-density area-scale supplier ladder:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-wilson-loop-area-law-as-area-scale-supplier.md`

## Result
Prepared a `C82` promotion target: add a short, hypothesis-separated paragraph to `papers/planck-area/main.md` near `Remark E4a` explaining how a confining gauge sector supplies an effective area scale \(\sigma^{-1}\) (via dimensional transmutation), with `[Greensite2003Confinement]` as the anchor.

## Next
- `C82`: promote the paragraph into `papers/planck-area/main.md` and record diffstat.
