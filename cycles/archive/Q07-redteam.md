## Failure Modes
1. The draft blurs the hypothesis ladder: readers may think half-densities *force* Planck area, rather than “half-densities + dimensionless scalarization + background-free constancy + admissible-coupling sieve”.
2. The gravity-only \(d=4\) selection is read as “\(d=4\) is uniquely special”, ignoring that admitting additional dimensionful couplings (\(\Lambda_d\), \(\alpha'\), etc.) changes the sieve outcome.
3. The \(\alpha'\) example reads as dynamics (“string theory true”) rather than as an admissibility variant.

## Mitigations
- Keep the “knobs” separation explicit (H2.3 vs H2.4 vs H2.5 vs transmutation branch).
- Emphasize “gravity-only” as a *restricted-supplier* sieve; the moment other suppliers are admitted, uniqueness can disappear.
- Phrase the \(\alpha'\) example as “if a universal area parameter is admitted” (string interpretation optional/outlook).
