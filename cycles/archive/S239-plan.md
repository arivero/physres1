# S239 — Plan: Trace anomaly and index theorem from a_{D/2}

Study the connection between Remark HD-D4.2's heat-kernel trace and two
fundamental results: (i) conformal trace anomaly ⟨T^μ_μ⟩ ∝ a_{D/2},
(ii) Atiyah-Singer index theorem via heat kernel. Goal: a 3-line remark
for HD-QFT after Remark HD-D4.2.
