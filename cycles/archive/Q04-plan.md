# Q04 Plan

## Goal
Referee-style pass on the new follow-up draft `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` to ensure:
1. it stays concise and wave-1 scoped,
2. it does not overclaim about BV/measure rigor or about universal scales,
3. it cleanly separates canonical half-density kernels from scalarization conventions.

## Scope
1. `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` (read-only in this cycle).
2. Record findings/action items in `cycles/Q04-execution.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `cycles/Q04-execution.md` lists actionable edits tagged by cycle type.
2. No manuscript edits performed in this cycle.
