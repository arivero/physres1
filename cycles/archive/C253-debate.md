# C253 — Debate: HD-QFT expansion

## Q: Why these two additions and not others?
**A:** They close the two most obvious gaps:
- Section 4 had no concrete worked example (only abstract kernel formulas)
- Section 5 had no connection between the canonical delta kernel and UV divergences
Both additions directly reinforce the paper's thesis that D/2 is the canonical exponent.

## Q: Does HD-D5.3 overclaim about dimensional regularization?
**A:** No — it explicitly says "for D>2" and only claims the *scaling*, not the
coefficient. Scheme-dependent finite parts are outside scope.

## Q: Should we add the D=2 logarithmic edge case?
**A:** No — it's standard knowledge for the target audience and would dilute the
main point. The "for D>2" qualifier is sufficient.
