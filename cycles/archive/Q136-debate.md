# Q136 Debate: Referee Review of C250

The referee's HIGH-severity issue (misleading phrasing about exactness vs
limiting) was well-spotted. The original "exactly, not as a limiting statement"
was intended to emphasize that the discrete equality is an identity, but it
reads as dismissing the need for any limit — contradicting the next sentence.
Fix accepted.

The MEDIUM issues are reasonable but not urgent. The Pourciau debate is
scholarly detail that doesn't affect the correctness of the claims made here.
