# C126 Plan: Fix supplementary material reference in rg-fundamental

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Replace the dangling "supplementary material" reference at line 112 with a pointer to Section 5.9 (convention map), where the 2D and 3D loop integrals are actually given.

## Parent Q cycle
- Q79, Finding #5: pre-existing supplementary material reference with no actual supplementary section.

## Target
- `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`, line 112.
