# C45 Debate: Promote D=4 Simplification Now or Keep It in Study Notes?

## Hard Question
Should the D=4 cancellation in the conformal half-density Laplacian be promoted into a draft paper now, or kept only as a blackboard note until its invariant meaning is clarified?

## Current Resolution
Promote it *only* to the half-density QFT draft and only as a worked example, because:
- it is a concrete computation directly about the half-density conjugation already discussed there,
- it is fully reproducible (SymPy check recorded),
- the draft can carry an explicit caveat that it is a conformal-class observation and that its “dimension filter” interpretation is heuristic.

Do not yet promote it into the cornerstone `paper/main.md` or the Planck-area hypothesis ladder without a clearer invariant framing.
