# C48 Execution: Operator-Simplicity D=4 Sidebar in the Cornerstone Paper

## Work Completed
- Added a short sidebar near the scalarization-gauge discussion in `paper/main.md` recording the invariant conformal-rescaling formula for the half-density conjugated Laplacian and the \(D=4\) cancellation of the \(|\nabla\sigma|^2\) term.
- Linked to the detailed notes:
  - `papers/half-density-qft/main.md`,
  - `papers/planck-area/main.md`,
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-half-density-laplacian-conformal-rescaling-invariant.md`.

## Result
The cornerstone paper now tracks (briefly) a second, orthogonal “special dimension” appearance of \(D=4\): an operator-simplicity criterion under conformal scalarization-gauge changes, distinct from the half-density scale sieve.
