# C257 — Execution: Promote S222 into half-density-qft

## Changes
Inserted two remarks after Remark HD-D4.2 (line 188), before Section 5:

1. **Remark HD-D4.4** (Van Vleck determinant as the geometric half-density factor)
   - Transport equation ∇_μ(Δ^{1/2} ∇^μ s) = D Δ^{1/2}
   - Δ^{1/2} is the geometric half-density Jacobian
   - Explains why it appears in the heat kernel expansion
   - +5 lines

2. **Remark HD-D4.5** (Proper-time representation unifies the D/2 exponent)
   - Schwinger integral G = ∫ K(t) dt
   - Enumerates four manifestations of D/2
   - Makes paper's central thesis explicit
   - +4 lines

## Result
- Paper: 244 → 253 lines (+9), 5pp (6592 tok)
- Still within PLB ≤6pp limit

## Diffstat
(to be filled after staging)
