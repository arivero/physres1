# C71 Execution: Promote ISCO Derivation Into Relativistic Central Orbits Draft

## Work Completed
- Added subsection `4.3 Timelike circular orbits and ISCO` to `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`.
- Promoted the circular-branch formulas:
  \[
  L^2=\frac{Mr^2}{r-3M},\qquad
  E^2=\frac{(r-2M)^2}{r(r-3M)}.
  \]
- Derived stability threshold \(r>6M\) and stated the ISCO \(r_{\rm ISCO}=6M\), with \((E,L)\) at the ISCO.
