# C286 — Plan

Promote S267 finding: SR epicyclic frequency ratio for general q.

## Changes
1. Insert Remark 5.2d after Remark 5.2c in relativistic-central-orbits.
   Content: ω_r²/ω_φ² = 3−q−v²/c² — the Newtonian epicyclic ratio 3−q
   reduced by exactly β², independent of q. Unifies stability criterion
   (positivity), precession (q=2 specialization), and Remark 5.2c (special case).

## Source
S267 execution: Hamiltonian expansion gives m_eff = γm (not γ³m),
leading to the clean formula. Cross-checked against Newtonian limit,
q=2 specialization, GR comparison (1/6 ratio), and stability criterion.
