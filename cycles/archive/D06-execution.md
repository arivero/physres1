# D06 Execution: Log Submission-Hardening Wave + Queue Reader-Navigation Diagram/Table

Date: 2026-02-11

## Decision
- Chosen next target: add a compact reader-navigation table for the refinement-compatibility chain (previously listed as “Future Work”).
- Why now: it directly improves foundations-journal readability and lowers referee friction without introducing new technical claims.

## Updates made
- `docs/research-log.md`: recorded `Q49/C93/Q50` completion.
- `docs/research-state.md`: updated “Next Cycle Target” to `S64 → C94 → Q51`.

## Spawned cycles
- `S64`: draft the navigation table/boxed block (promotion candidate).
- `C94`: promote into `paper/main.md` and rebuild PDF.
- `Q51`: referee pass on `C94`.
