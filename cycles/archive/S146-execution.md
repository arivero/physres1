# S146 Execution: Mandelstam-Tamm energy-time uncertainty

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work Done
- Wrote blackboard slot 1: Mandelstam-Tamm relation ΔE·Δt_A ≥ ℏ/2 as temporal analog of action-angle tradeoff.
- Quantum foundations specialist reviewed: 7/8 claims CORRECT. Derivation, Ehrenfest equation, Pauli's theorem, static eigenstates, structural parallel, references all verified.
- WRONG: harmonic oscillator example had Δt_x = 1/ω (should be 1/(2ω|α|) at max velocity) and product = ℏ|α| (should be ℏ/2, saturation). Fix: promoted remark states saturation ΔE·Δt_x = ℏ/2 without the incorrect intermediate values.
