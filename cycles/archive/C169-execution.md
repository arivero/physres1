## Manuscript edit
Added Remark 6.4 (Husimi function: visualizing action-angle states in phase space) after Remark 6.3.
Content: Q(α) = ⟨α|ρ̂|α⟩/π, Fock ring at |α|=√n (θ-independent), coherent Gaussian blob, ring vs blob = Fourier tradeoff in phase space.
## Build
PDF builds cleanly (6 pages, pdflatex).
