# S275 Debate: Compress or keep current wording?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Is additional compression worth opening `C300`, or should `Remark P1.1a` remain frozen?

## Resolution
Open `C300` only if readability is prioritized; otherwise current wording is already acceptable. Compression is optional, not corrective.

## Iteration 2 addendum
Compression is only acceptable if mechanism-separation and marginal caveat both survive; this favors a two-sentence blend over any single one-liner candidate.

## Iteration 3 addendum
Given caveat coverage and compactness tradeoff, a 34-word two-sentence variant is the current best default.

## Iteration 4 addendum
Readability metrics show substantial compression benefit, but still not enough to force immediate C-cycle action without an explicit readability pass request.

## Iteration 5 addendum
A stricter caveat gate favors `D4plus` over `D2`: `D4plus` restores explicit small-`r` scope and keeps the non-classification caveat while remaining shorter.

## Iteration 6 addendum
When compression candidates are close, notation/style compatibility should break ties in favor of direct manuscript readiness.

## Iteration 7 addendum
Resolution tightened: `S275` should answer technical validity only; manuscript-editorial readiness belongs to `D/C`.
