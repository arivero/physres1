# C11 Debate

## Claim
RG should be presented as definitional: it is the consistency condition that makes composed refinement meaningful when naive limits diverge.

## Objection
Calling RG “fundamental” can sound rhetorical unless backed by an explicit computation in a concrete model.

## Resolution
Frame the statement as a labeled heuristic in the main paper and commit to a follow-up that includes at least one explicit beta-function computation.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
The derivative is a counterterm example: \(f(x+\varepsilon)/\varepsilon - f(x)/\varepsilon \to f'(x)\).

## Objection
This is too elementary and risks trivializing QFT renormalization.

## Resolution
Use it explicitly as a *micro-model* to explain the logic “divergent regulated pieces + local subtraction = finite limit,” while emphasizing that QFT adds nontrivial combinatorics and scheme dependence.

## Status
Accepted.
