## Failure Modes to Watch
1. Using transmutation to claim uniqueness of \(d=4\) (it generally won’t).
2. Mixing “scale from RG” with “scale from gravity-only monomials” without labeling the branch point.
3. Overpromising: transmutation produces a scale, but not automatically a *universal* one (it depends on couplings/UV completion).
