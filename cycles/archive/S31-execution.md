# S31 Execution: Minimal Timelike-Structure Map

## Work Completed
- Wrote a compact structural map in `blackboards/2026-02-10-minimal-timelike-structure-for-areal-postulates.md`:
  - no timelike direction: only \(I_1,I_2\) invariants (insufficient for branch parameter),
  - chosen timelike \(u^\mu\): projected spatial bivector and scalar \(\ell_{(u)}\),
  - source-anchored \(u^\mu=U^\mu\): minimal choice for the current central-source problem.
- Defined
  \[
  \ell_{(u)}:=\frac1m\sqrt{\frac12\,M^{(u)}_{\mu\nu}M_{(u)}^{\mu\nu}},
  \qquad
  M^{(u)\mu\nu}=h(u)^\mu{}_\alpha h(u)^\nu{}_\beta M^{\alpha\beta}.
  \]
- Recorded operational interpretation:
  - fixing \(\ell_{(u)}\) is equivalent to fixing proper-time areal speed in the \(u\)-frame;
  - coordinate-time rates are secondary and depend on the \(u\)-frame lapse factor.

## Result
For this branch, the minimal acceptable extra structure is a distinguished timelike direction supplied by the source worldline. Using a generic observer field is possible but introduces additional convention dependence without added explanatory power.
