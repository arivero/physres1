# S240 — Execution

**Analysis:**
- Schwartz (1954) impossibility theorem: no associative algebra extending
  D'(ℝ) with pointwise multiplication of C⁰ functions. Hence δ² undefined.
- In QFT: loop integrals = products of propagators at coincident points.
  G(x,y)² is singular at x=y (same diagonal singularity as δ²).
- The table's hierarchy: rows 1-2 (safe, no products), rows 3-4 (single
  coincidence, manageable via self-adjoint extensions), row 5 (irreducible).
- The remark bridges the table to QFT perturbation theory.

**Content produced:** Remark 5.3a (3 lines). Insert after the summary table
(line 228), before Section 6 Outlook (line 230).
