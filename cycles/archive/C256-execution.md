# C256 — Execution: Delta-objects scalarization example

## Changes
**Paper**: papers/delta-objects/main.md (204 → 207 lines, +3, 5pp, 6214 tok)

### Example 5.1a (after line 189, now line 191)
Concrete d=2 scalarization: transmutation scale α provides the reference half-density
σ_* = α^{-1}|dx|^{1/2}. Bound-state condition κ = α is dimensionless and RG-invariant.
Shows "RG invariants supply scalarization scales" concretely.

## Diffstat
(Pending — will be computed at commit time)
