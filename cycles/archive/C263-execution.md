# C263 — Execution: Promote S228 into HD-QFT

## Changes
Remark HD-D5.4 (Functional determinant from the heat-kernel trace)
inserted after Remark HD-D5.3, before Remark HD-D5.1.

Content: ζ-function ζ_P(s) = Γ(s)^{-1} ∫ t^{s-1} Tr K(t) dt has poles at
s = D/2 - n from Seeley-DeWitt expansion. Functional determinant
det P = exp(-ζ'_P(0)) is finite, coordinate-independent, intrinsic in
half-density framework. Uses [Vassilevich2003] (already cited).

## Result
- Paper: 253 → 256 lines (+3), 5pp.
