# S56 Debate: Keep Gauge/Confinement in the Planck-Area Paper?

## Question
Should gauge confinement and Wilson loops be discussed inside `papers/planck-area/main.md`, or moved to a separate dependent paper?

## Current Resolution
Allow one short hypothesis-separated paragraph in `papers/planck-area/main.md` as a scale-supplier option, but keep any deeper gauge-theory discussion in a separate draft if it grows beyond that.
