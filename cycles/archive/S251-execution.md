# S251 — Execution
Verified: the action S(q(t),t) satisfies HJ classically on each smooth
segment. At the kink t₀, ∂S/∂t has a jump discontinuity equal to the
energy jump ΔH = J·v̄ (Remark 3.2a). This is precisely the structure of
a Crandall-Lions viscosity solution. The kinked S is Lipschitz-continuous,
piecewise C¹, and satisfies the sub/super-differential conditions at t₀.

Recommended Option B: expand Outlook item 2 with specificity, rather than
adding a remark in the main text (too specialized, paper at 7pp).
NOT PROMOTED to manuscript remark.
