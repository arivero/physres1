# Q153 — Execution

Verified all claims:
1. a₁ contribution shifts t^{-D/2} → t^{1-D/2}, integral gives Λ^{D-4} ✓
2. Each a_n reduces divergence by Λ² ✓
3. D=4: mass Λ², wave function ln Λ, rest finite ✓
4. References to HD-D5.1, HD-D5.3 correct ✓
5. Placement between HD-D5.3 and HD-D5.4 correct ✓

Verdict: **PASS**.
