# DX09 Plan: Cross-thread connection probe + next-direction assessment
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
1. Read `docs/anomalies.md` (if it exists) for unresolved tensions.
2. Assess which of the unstarted roadmap items (A–F, J) would produce the most value per cycle.
3. Check whether any satellite paper now references material from *another* satellite (cross-satellite links).
4. Identify the single best "next big move" for the project.
