# C24 Debate

## Question
Does treating \(\sigma_\ast(\mu)\) running as “\(Z(\mu)\)” risk reifying a convention as physics, or can we phrase it safely as a bookkeeping identity whose physical content lies only in RG-invariant combinations?

## Working Resolution
Phrase it as a representation identity: running scalarization is equivalent to external-leg normalization. Explicitly state that \(\sigma_\ast(\mu)\) is scheme/convention and only RG-invariant combinations are physical.
