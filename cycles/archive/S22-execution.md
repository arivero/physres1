# S22 Execution: Control Map \(\tau\) as Refinement Compatibility

## Work Completed
- Wrote a derivation-first note defining:
  - refinement/coarse-graining maps between discretizations,
  - a compatibility condition expressed as a commuting diagram with a parameter-flow \(\tau_b\),
  - a Gaussian kernel semigroup example where \(\tau_b\) is trivial and compatibility is exact.
- Recorded interpretations and failure modes (scheme dependence vs invariants).

## Output
- `blackboards/2026-02-10-control-map-tau-refinement-compatibility.md`
