# S206 — Execution

## What was done
1. Read cornerstone §3 (Newton's polygon: D1.1, D1.2, P1.1), §5 (mollifier
   localization: P3.2, D3.2), and dirac-probes Theorem 2.1, Remark 2.2,
   Section 4.5.
2. Identified the threefold "probe-then-refine" pattern:
   - Mollifier: global stationarity → pointwise EL via ε→0.
   - Polygon: discrete equal-area → continuous areal velocity via Δt→0.
   - Time-slicing: N-impulse composition → path integral via N→∞.
3. Key structural insight: invariant is exact at every finite scale; the
   limit merely converts form (averaged→pointwise, discrete→continuous,
   finite→infinite). Local regularity is the gate.
4. Articulated failure modes for each: distributional (corners/impulses),
   non-convergent (bad polygon accumulation), divergent (no Lebesgue on
   path space, needs renormalization).
5. Drafted Remark 2.3 for dirac-probes paper (~8 lines).
6. Overwrote blackboard slot 3 (was Padé, promoted via C177).

## Blackboard
Slot 3: "Mollifier–Polygon Refinement Parallel"

## Proposed promotion
Remark 2.3 in dirac-probes paper (after Remark 2.2), pending reviewer
feedback and C246 cycle.
