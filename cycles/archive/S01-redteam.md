## Failure Modes
1. “Branch leakage”: importing conclusions from one branch (e.g., transmutation) into another (e.g., integrality) without explicit assumptions.
2. “Dimension confusion”: mixing spatial vs spacetime dimensions in the sieve equations.
3. “Motivation gap”: asserting H2.5 without an operational criterion.

## Mitigations
- Keep each branch’s assumptions explicit and repeat them at each conclusion.
- Use a notation box for which dimension is in play.
- Phrase outputs as: “If (assumptions), then (consequence)”.
