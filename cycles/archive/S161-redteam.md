Risk: tomography is more experimental than the paper's theoretical focus.
Mitigation: remark explicitly ties to the paper's existing Wigner function discussion
(Remark 6.6), showing these phase-space objects are experimentally accessible. Keeps
focus on the reconstruction principle (Radon transform) rather than experimental details.
