## Failure mode 1: Obvious to experts
Experts already know d/2 controls Sobolev embeddings, heat kernels,
and delta distributions.

**Mitigation**: The remark's value is connecting these to the
half-density formalism of §2, which is NOT standard. The claim is
that half-densities EXPLAIN the shared exponent, not just that it exists.

## Failure mode 2: Page creep
194 lines, still 4pp. Acceptable.
