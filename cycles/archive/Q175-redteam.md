# Q175 Red Team: Referee attacks on C292

Date: 2026-02-14

## Likely referee objections
- "Only first-order in potential; higher-order control is missing."
  - Mitigation: keep explicit scope and schedule optional C293 for strengthened error control.
- "Failure mode examples are broad."
  - Mitigation: tie failure language to specific divergence of the Duhamel convolution and existing Appendix 10.5 RG treatment.
