# Q168 — Debate

## Should Remark 3.1b use "overwhelms" for the barrier comparison?
The remark says the centrifugal barrier "overwhelms the attractive potential ∝ r⁻⁽ᑫ⁻¹⁾ iff q < 3."
Strictly, the comparison is between r⁻² (barrier) and r⁻⁽ᑫ⁻¹⁾ (attraction) as r→0. The barrier
dominates iff its exponent is larger, i.e., 2 > q−1, giving q < 3. "Overwhelms" is an informal
but correct description of r⁻² / r⁻⁽ᑫ⁻¹⁾ → ∞ as r→0. Acceptable for a remark.

## Is "generically irrational" rigorous enough for Remark 3.2a?
The claim is that ω = √(1 − K²/(c²L²)) is irrational for all but a measure-zero set of L.
This follows from the countability of rationals and the smoothness of the map L ↦ ω.
"Generically" in the measure-theoretic sense (complement of a measure-zero set) is standard
usage in dynamical systems. The C284 red team verified the same point (Attack 2). No issue.

## Does "open family to measure-zero subset" need clarification?
In Newtonian mechanics, the full set of bound initial conditions (open in phase space) produces
closed orbits. In SR, only a measure-zero set of L values yields rational ω. The phrase is
slightly informal — what passes from "open" to "measure-zero" is the set of angular-momentum
values admitting closed orbits, not the phase-space set directly. However, since L is a
continuous parameter indexing bound-orbit families, the statement is essentially correct and
the meaning is clear in context. LOW severity; no fix needed.

## Is q=1 ever called "inverse-linear" in the literature?
The name is descriptive (F = K/r = inverse-linear) rather than a standard textbook label.
Unlike q=2 (Coulomb/Kepler) or q=−1 (Hooke), q=1 has no universally recognized name.
"Inverse-linear" is accurate and self-explanatory. The old label "Hooke" was actively wrong.
