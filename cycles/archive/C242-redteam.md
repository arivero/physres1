## Checks
1. No cycle labels in manuscript: verified.
2. Remark HD-D4.2 cross-references: Derivation HD-D1.1a (normalization),
   Section 5 (counterterms). Both exist.
3. Reference numbering: #6 DeWitt, #7 Vassilevich, following existing sequence.
4. Mathematical content: expansion formula, VVD transport equation, trace
   formula — all verified against standard references in S202.
5. Context specification: "on a Riemannian (M,g)" — correctly limits to
   elliptic case; no claim about Lorentzian signature.
6. Page count: 4pp compiled, within PLB limit.
