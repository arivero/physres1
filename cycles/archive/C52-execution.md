# C52 Execution: Add Schwarzschild Baseline Chapter

## Work Completed
- Updated `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`:
  - added a Schwarzschild geodesic baseline section with conserved \(E,L\),
  - wrote the effective potential and radial equation,
  - recorded the photon-sphere result \(r_{\mathrm{ph}}=3M\) and \(b=3\sqrt3\,M\),
  - cited `[Carroll1997LectureGR]` as baseline anchor.
