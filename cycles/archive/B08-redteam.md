# B08 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Wrong metadata** (especially for `[Dirac1933]`) undermines credibility.
2. **Reference sprawl** adds unnecessary citations without improving claim support.
3. **Policy mismatch**: manuscripts accidentally keep Rivero-authored citations.

## Mitigations
1. Verify `[Dirac1933]` venue/pages against multiple independent records.
2. Add only two classic anchors (Groenewold, Moyal) as minimal replacements.
3. Run a Rivero-citation grep gate before Wave-1 submission.
