# Q171 Execution: Referee pass for C287

Date: 2026-02-14
Status: PASS

## Findings
1. **Correctness:** formula \(q_\mathrm{crit}=\nu+1\) is consistent with existing derivation logic and with Newton/SR instantiations.
2. **Claim boundary:** promoted text correctly limits scope to asymptotic fixed-\(L\) argument and avoids asserting universality.
3. **Notation:** no conflicts with existing section notation.
4. **Reader flow:** new remark improves transition from specific shift explanation (3.1b) to general rule abstraction.

## Required fixes
- None.

## Follow-up cycles
- Optional `B` follow-up to ingest primary historical PDFs and close pending stubs.
