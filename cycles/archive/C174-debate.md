# C174 Debate: Wigner function Remark 6.6

Date: 2026-02-13

## Pro
- Natural completion of Remarks 6.4 (Husimi) + 6.5 (squeezed)
- Explains *why* Husimi is non-negative (Gaussian smoothing of Wigner)
- Connects sign changes to quantum coherences invisible in Husimi

## Con
- Action-angle paper is about indeterminacy, not phase-space representations
  → But Remarks 6.4–6.5 already opened this door; 6.6 closes it

## Resolution
Promoted as compact remark. Maintains focus on the action-angle tradeoff
interpretation rather than Wigner function theory per se.
