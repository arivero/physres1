# B00 Debate

## Question
How do we add “independent anchors” without letting literature drive the argument (anti-herd constraint)?

## Notes
- Our default should remain derivation-first; citations are for attribution/sanity-checking.
- Prefer one standard reference for each key technical assertion (point interactions classification, 2D delta renormalization), but keep the manuscripts self-contained.
