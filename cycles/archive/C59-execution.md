# C59 Execution: Promote Non-Circular Planar Extension

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5g` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` after D1.5f.
- Promoted the general planar (non-circular) kinematic identities:
  \[
  \ell=\gamma r v_\perp=\gamma r^2\dot\phi,\quad
  \frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{\ell}{2\gamma},\quad
  \frac{dA}{d\tau}=\frac{\ell}{2}.
  \]
- Stated explicitly that this extension is kinematic and not tied to a specific force law.
