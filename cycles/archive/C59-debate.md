# C59 Debate: Should This Stay in Planck-Area Paper?

## Question
Does adding non-circular kinematics dilute focus from the Planck-area theme?

## Current Resolution
The addition is brief and justified:
- it prevents misreading D1.5f as circular-only,
- it is a kinematic identity, not a new branch detour,
- it strengthens interpretation discipline with minimal text cost.
