## Work Done
- Added Remark 3.1 after Section 3, before Section 4.
- Real spherical harmonics (p_x, d_{xy}, etc.) as equal-weight ±m superpositions breaking azimuthal uniformity.
- Var(Lz) = m²ℏ² quantifies the uncertainty cost of directional lobes.
- Avoided explicit formulas per reviewer recommendation (phase convention sensitivity).
- action-angle: 139 → 142 lines (7 pages).
