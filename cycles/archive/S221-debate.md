# S221 — Debate

## Why this target?
Section 5 was the thinnest section (12 lines) with abstract content ("conditional identification") lacking a concrete example. The d=2 case is the simplest non-trivial instance where scalarization matters.

## Alternatives considered
- d=3 example (scattering length as scalarization parameter): more complex, involves length^{3/2} which is less clean.
- d=1 example: trivial, no renormalization needed, scalarization is straightforward.
- General-d comparison table: too long for PLB.
