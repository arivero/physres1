Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Inserted Remark 6.8 after Remark 6.7 (spin coherent states), before Section 7 (Outlook).
2. Content: Bargmann-Segal representation — Fock states as monomials z^n/√(n!), coherent states as reproducing kernels K_α(z)=e^{ᾱz}, creation/annihilation as multiplication/differentiation, Husimi as squared Bargmann modulus, spin-j truncation to polynomials of degree ≤ 2j.
3. Built PDF: 9 pages, 154 lines (+3).
