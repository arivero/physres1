# C49 Execution: Promote S21 Generic-\(q\) Remark

## Work Completed
- Inserted a compact generic-\(q\) circular-orbit remark after `Derivation D1.5` in `papers/planck-area/main.md`:
  - derived \(4m\dot A^2=K r^{3-q}\) and \(r=(4m\dot A^2/K)^{1/(3-q)}\) (with \(q=3\) special case),
  - showed linear reduced-Compton scaling occurs only for \(q=2\) when \(\dot A=cL_P\) and \(L_P^2=G\hbar/c^3\) (4D identity),
  - recorded the Newtonian dimension link \(q=n-1\) (with \(n=2\) logarithmic exception).

## Result
The Planck-areal-speed witness is now explicitly identified as an inverse-square feature, and its relation to spatial dimension is stated as a separate, standard scaling fact.
