# C90 Debate: Repeat the toy computation in the RCP appendix or reference an earlier derivation?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
In the RCP appendix, should we reproduce the Gaussian-kernel semigroup normalization calculation, or should we reference the existing derivation already present earlier in the manuscript?

## Options
1. Repeat the computation in Appendix 10.3 (self-contained RCP section, but duplicates content).
2. State the operational closure form and point to the existing semigroup derivation (keeps the appendix compact and avoids duplication).

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
The manuscript already contains the calculation as `Derivation D4.1a`; the RCP appendix should focus on making the principle operational (closure + parameter update maps) and use the earlier derivation as the explicit witness that compatibility can fail.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- If a referee insists on a self-contained RCP appendix, a later `C` wave can move or duplicate the derivation with explicit cross-references.
