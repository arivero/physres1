# Q177 Debate: Does D12.3 over-index on a special case?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Is the harmonic-oscillator exact witness too special to materially improve Package A?

## Recommendation
No. It fills a specific gap between free and perturbative witnesses by providing an all-order, nontrivial closed-form composition benchmark.
