## Results
1. **Example D4.2b (free-particle two-slice, cornerstone)**: CLEAN. Mathematical physicist subagent verified all six steps: completing the square, Gaussian integral, effective action, ℏ→0 limit, classical infimum, no sign/factor errors.
2. **Example 6.2 (hydrogen atom, action-angle)**: Already verified by pedantic atomic physics professor in S111.
3. **Remark 3.2 (Itô/Stratonovich, uncuttable)**: Already verified by probability theorist in S110.

No changes needed.
