# S144 Execution: Dimensional regularization

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work Done
- Wrote blackboard slot 1: Dim reg as alternative refinement scheme (d=4-ε). 1/ε poles, MS-bar subtraction, L-loop Laurent series, gauge+Lorentz preservation.
- Perturbative QFT expert reviewed: all physics claims CORRECT. Minor nuance on lattice gauge invariance (Wilson's lattice preserves lattice gauge symmetry; only naive cutoff breaks both). Softened in promotion to "naive momentum cutoff."
