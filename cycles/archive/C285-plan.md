# C285 — Plan

## Goal
Promote the Sommerfeld fine structure connection into the relativistic paper,
with corresponding Outlook expansion and bibliography additions.

## Changes
1. **Remark 3.2b** (Sommerfeld fine structure): Insert after Remark 3.2a.
   Shows the precession parameter omega is exactly Sommerfeld's 1916 quantity;
   quantizing L=k*hbar gives the fine structure formula. Source: S262.
2. **Outlook item 3**: Add a third extension pointing to semiclassical
   quantization of the refinement-witness bounds. Source: S263.
3. **References [3] and [4]**: Add Sommerfeld 1916 and Bertrand 1873 as
   cited in Remarks 3.2b and 3.2a respectively. Source: S264.
4. **Citation in Remark 3.2a**: Add [Bertrand1873ClosedOrbits] to existing
   Bertrand's theorem mention.

## Expected impact
- ~6 net new lines (280 → 286).
- 4 references (up from 2).
- Paper still 5pp, well within PLB 6pp limit.
