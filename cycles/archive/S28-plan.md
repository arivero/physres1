# S28 Plan: Proper-Time Areal-Speed Variant (Convention Sensitivity)

## Goal
Test whether the SR interpolation result in D1.5b depends on fixing coordinate-time areal speed \(dA/dt\) versus proper-time areal speed \(dA/d\tau\).

## Scope
1. Stay in the same inverse-square mechanical SR model.
2. Derive the \(dA/d\tau=\) const branch explicitly.
3. Compare against the existing \(dA/dt=\) const branch in terms of asymptotics and domain of validity.

## Acceptance Tests
- Closed gravitational formula for \(r(M)\) under fixed \(dA/d\tau\).
- Explicit comparison showing whether the \(2L_P\) floor survives.
- Clear statement of what is model-convention dependent.
