# Q60 Plan: Referee pass on C103

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Referee-style review of C103 manuscript changes (Runge--Kutta fix, Newton-limit Remark R1.1, companion regularity parenthetical).

## Parent cycle
- `C103`

## Review checklist
1. Mathematical correctness of R1.1 content.
2. Label taxonomy consistency (R1.1 prefix).
3. Typography consistency (Runge--Kutta across all manuscripts).
4. Companion regularity parenthetical matches main paper.
5. Citation keys match bibliography entries (B14).
6. Placement of R1.1 in the section flow.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q60-*.md` only.

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts, bibliography, blackboards, notes, sources.

## Acceptance criteria
- All C103 changes reviewed.
- Actionable issues (if any) spawned as follow-up cycles.
