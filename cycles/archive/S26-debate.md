# S26 Debate: What “SR Stability” Means Here

## Question
Is it legitimate to talk about SR “stability of circular orbits” for an inverse-power central force using a scalar potential \(U(r)\), given that true relativistic interactions should come from fields (and generically include retardation/magnetism)?

## Current Resolution
Yes, as long as we label the scope correctly:
- This is a **mechanical SR model**: a point particle in an external, time-independent, central scalar potential \(U(r)\) (lab-frame Hamiltonian).
- The result is used as a **witness/constraint**: what changes already at the kinematic SR level before GR/QFT enter.
- We do **not** claim it is a fully covariant interacting two-body theory; that belongs to later waves (field-mediated interactions).
