# S40 Execution: Cross-Dimensional Contact-Flow Data Map

## Work Completed
- Built a compact \(1\)D/\(2\)D/\(3\)D map tying each contact-interaction case to its effective compatibility data space.
- Distinguished:
  - \(1\)D full-line contact family as matrix-valued boundary data flow,
  - \(2\)D contact as one transmutation scale \(\kappa_\ast\),
  - \(3\)D s-wave contact branch as one scattering-length parameter \(a\).
- Connected this to the S39 weak-derivative message: the local subtraction grammar stays the same; the flowed data object changes by dimension.
- Logged map in:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-contact-flow-data-space-map-1d-2d-3d.md`.

## Result
Prepared a concise, manuscript-ready bridge statement for Section 5.8 that explains why fixed-point complexity differs by dimension without changing the core RG-compatibility thesis.

## Next Spawn
- `C67`: add one short heuristic remark near Section 5.8 codifying this data-space perspective.
