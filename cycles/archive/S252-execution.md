Verified Sobolev classification:
- q ∈ C⁰ ∩ W^{1,∞} (continuous, bounded velocity)
- q ∉ C¹ (velocity discontinuity at t₀ violates Theorem 2.1's H1)
- q̈ = (J/m)δ(t-t₀) ∈ H^{-1} \ L², so q ∉ H²
- q ∈ W^{1,p} for all p but q ∉ W^{2,p} for any p ≥ 1

The classification makes precise where the kinked trajectory sits in the
regularity hierarchy of Remark 2.2a: W^{1,∞} ⊂ H¹ suffices for action
convergence, but C¹ is needed for pointwise EL recovery.

Proposed Remark 4.2a (Sobolev regularity). Strong callback to Section 2.
However, paper is at 7pp (over PLB 6pp limit). NOT PROMOTED.
