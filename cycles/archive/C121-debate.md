# C121 Debate: Promote S83 into planck-area (Remark PA-E5c)

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
PA-E5b already says "structurally independent and combine multiplicatively." Does PA-E5c add anything?

## Resolution
PA-E5c adds the explicit dimensional accounting: [G₀] = length^{-d}, [T] = length^d, scalarization = κ_*^{-d/2}. PA-E5b states the qualitative separation; PA-E5c gives the quantitative verification. It also connects to PA-D1.4a (the free-propagator semigroup), showing the same half-density pairing mechanism applies with a dynamical ingredient at the vertex. The d=4 extrapolation (Λ_*^{-2} = area) is new — PA-E5b only discussed d=2.
