# Q131 — Plan

## Goal
Hostile referee review of C245 (Remark 3.2 in relativistic orbits:
SR precession as 1/6 of GR).

## Scope
- Mathematics verification (Binet equation, ω = 1/γ, 1/6 ratio)
- Citation check (BoscagginDambrosioFeltrin2020)
- Physical interpretation validity
- Conceptual framing of SR vs GR comparison

## Acceptance tests
1. All formulas verified symbolically.
2. Citations appropriate for their claims.
3. Physical caveats adequately stated.
