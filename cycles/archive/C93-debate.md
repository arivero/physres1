# C93 Debate: Keep Section 10 as “Technical Appendices” or rename to “Appendices”?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Does the label “Technical Appendices” help a foundations-journal reader, or does it sound like internal scaffolding?

## Decision
Keep “Technical Appendices” but remove the “(Continuation Stages)” qualifier and any versioning language.

## Rationale
The appendices genuinely are technical worked extensions. The problem is not “technical” but “continuation/versioning” wording, which reads as internal draft history.
