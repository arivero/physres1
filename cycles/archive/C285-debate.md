## Remark 3.2b (Sommerfeld fine structure)
The mathematical identification is exact: the paper's omega^2 = 1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2)
with K = Ze^2/(4pi eps_0) and L = k hbar gives omega = sqrt(1 - Z^2 alpha^2/k^2),
which is literally Sommerfeld's 1916 quantity. The remark is 3 sentences, self-contained,
and correctly attributed ("Sommerfeld used," not "we discover"). The Sommerfeld-Dirac
"puzzle" (agreement despite missing spin) is flagged with "(with k → j + 1/2)" without
over-discussing it. Cost: 2 lines. The paper gains a concrete physical application
(hydrogen fine structure) to complement the gravitational application (Mercury precession).

## Outlook item 3
Provides a genuine third direction: upward from classical SR to quantum, orthogonal
to item 1 (sideways to field theory) and item 2 (downward to refinement spine).
References Remark 3.2b for context, avoiding duplication. Cost: 1 line + "Two"→"Three."

## References
Sommerfeld 1916 is essential — a referee would flag its absence given Remark 3.2b.
Bertrand 1873 is appropriate since Remark 3.2a explicitly states and analyzes the theorem.
Both are foundational works, consistent with the project's citation style.

## Verdict
All changes are clean, compact, and well-supported by S262-S264. The paper's reference
list doubles from 2 to 4, which is appropriate for a PLB note touching on historical results.
