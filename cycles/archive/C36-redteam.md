## Failure Modes
1. The kernel relation is stated with the wrong \(|g|^{\pm 1/4}\) powers (common sign error).
2. The micro-edit grows scope and starts repeating content from `papers/planck-area/main.md`.

## Mitigations
- Derive the kernel relation from the field redefinition \(\psi=|g|^{1/4}\phi\) and the change of pairing measure; keep it as a single displayed equation.
- Keep universality/Planck-area discussion confined to §6 as pointer only.
