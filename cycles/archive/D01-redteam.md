# D01 Red Team: Risks of an Action–Angle Remark in the Main Paper

Date: 2026-02-10

## Failure modes
- Scope creep into a QM textbook discussion of angle operators:
  - Mitigation: keep only the separation-of-variables witness \(|\psi|^2\) independent of \(\phi\) in an \(L_z\) eigenstate.
- Reader confusion (why this is in the paper):
  - Mitigation: explicitly connect to the manuscript’s “classical paths arise as semiclassical packets / stationary-phase concentration” theme.
