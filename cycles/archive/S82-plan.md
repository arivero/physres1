# S82 Plan: Free-propagator composition closes the half-density normalization loop

Date: 2026-02-13

## Thread
Half-densities / Planck-area ladder (thread 2). Targets Open Problem #1 in `papers/planck-area/main.md`.

## Goal
Show, in the concrete free-particle propagator model, that:
1. The semigroup (composition) property requires the d/2 exponent in the prefactor.
2. This exponent is exactly the half-density weight (PA-D1.2a, PA-D1.4).
3. Scalarizing the composed kernel forces a length^{d/2} constant (PA-H2.2–H2.4).
4. In the tangent-groupoid near-diagonal picture, time t plays the role of ε, and the (m/(2πiℏt))^{d/2} factor is the ε^{-d/2} rescaling.

## Scope
One blackboard note with a self-contained computation (free particle on R^d). No manuscript edits.

## Deliverable
