# Q178 Execution: Referee pass on C295 sanity-limit hardening

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C295`

## Findings
- PASS.
- Free-limit check (`omega->0`) is clear and correctly tied to hyperbolic expansions.
- Short-time localization statement is appropriately phrased at distribution level.
- Adds readability without overclaiming.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- `C296` (optional): return to the higher-complexity Package B self-adjointness/deeper extension witness.

## Notes (non-actions)
- Package A appears technically coherent at current witness depth.
