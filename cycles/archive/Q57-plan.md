# Q57 Plan: referee pass on C100 step-halving/rooted-tree polish

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C100`: unify elementary-differential notation and add the \(O(h^3)\) branch-tree remark.

## Goal
Referee-pass the `C100` manuscript changes for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience in the step-halving/rooted-tree witness sections.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q57-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: derivation vs heuristic labels are appropriate.
- Notation: \(f'(y)[v]\), \(f''(y)[v,w]\), and rooted-tree labels are consistent.
- Citations: none added in `C100`; ensure no missing anchors are implied.
- Reader flow: the new \(O(h^3)\) remark is scoped and readable in both manuscripts.

## Acceptance criteria
- Findings recorded with concrete required/optional follow-ups, expressed as spawned `S/B/C/D` cycles rather than direct edits.
