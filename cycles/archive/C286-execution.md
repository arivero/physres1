# C286 — Execution

## Change applied
Inserted Remark 5.2d (SR epicyclic frequency ratio) after Remark 5.2c
(line 273 of previous version).

Text (~3 lines): states ω_r²/ω_φ² = 3−q−v²/c², notes the universal −β²
correction, connects positivity to stability, and identifies ω as the
frequency ratio at q=2 (making Remark 5.2c a special case).
