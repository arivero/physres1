# C77 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim**: readers think unitarity always fixes ordering uniquely.
2. **Distraction**: "unitarity selects symmetric" invites a detour into representation theory.
3. **Vagueness**: "half-density convention" is unclear to new readers.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the clause scoped to the toy witness and leave the general statement as "requires a prescription".
2. Keep it to one clause; details stay in dependent notes/blackboards.
3. Use "half-density" only as a parenthetical hint; the main paper already develops the concept later.
