# Q145 — Execution: Referee review of C260

## Verdict: PASS

No new mathematical content to verify. Remark 4.3c reorganizes existing
results (r_ph=3M from Section 4.1, r_ISCO=6M from Section 4.3) into a
comparison. The ratio r_ISCO/r_ph = 6M/3M = 2 is trivially correct.
The "L-independent" claim is correct since both r_ph and r_ISCO depend
only on M (not on L).

No issues found.
