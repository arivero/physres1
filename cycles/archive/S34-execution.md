# S34 Execution: Observability Criterion for Projected Areal Rates

## Work Completed
- Derived a measurable projected areal-rate observable:
  \[
  \dot A_{\mathbf n}(t)=\frac12\,\mathbf n\cdot(\mathbf r\times\mathbf v)
  =\frac12\,\ell_{\mathbf n}^{(t)},
  \]
  and proper-time counterpart
  \[
  \frac{dA_{\mathbf n}}{d\tau}
  =\frac12\,\mathbf n\cdot\boldsymbol\ell.
  \]
- Derived perturbation response:
  \[
  \frac{d}{dt}\big(\mathbf n\cdot\boldsymbol\ell\big)
  =\frac{1}{m}\,\mathbf n\cdot(\mathbf r\times\mathbf F),
  \]
  so deviations from constant projected areal rate directly measure projected torque density.
- Wrote a concrete observability checklist in `blackboards/2026-02-10-observability-criterion-for-projected-areal-rates.md`.

## Result
Projected areal-rate postulates are falsifiable once the model specifies:
1) projection normal \(\mathbf n\),  
2) clock convention (\(t\) or \(\tau\)), and  
3) reconstruction of \((\mathbf r,\mathbf v)\) in a chosen source frame.  
Without these, the postulate is not an empirical statement.
