# S268 — Plan

Revisit the S260 deferred finding: at a q=2 circular orbit, E_circ = mc^2 omega
where omega is the precession parameter. S260 recommended promotion but was
deferred because "E=mc^2 omega partially overlaps Remark 5.2c."

Tasks:
1. Determine precisely what Remark 5.2c already conveys and what E = mc^2 omega
   would add beyond it.
2. Assess whether the physical interpretation (omega as a binding measure:
   omega=1 unbound, omega->0 maximally bound) constitutes genuinely new content.
3. Check whether W_min = mc^2 omega is already implicit from Section 3.1 + Remark 3.2.
4. Verdict: PROMOTE with draft text and location, or NOT PROMOTE with reason.
