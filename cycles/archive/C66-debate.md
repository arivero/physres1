# C66 Debate: Promote to RG Paper or Delta-Objects Paper?

## Question
Should the weak-derivative bridge be promoted in the RG draft or only in `delta-objects`?

## Current Resolution
Promote in the RG draft (Section 3), because it directly reinforces the core thesis that local subtraction plus a compatibility limit is already present before full QFT machinery.
