# Q157 Debate

**Blue (defender):** The impulse-work formula is a straightforward algebraic identity for the free-particle case, and the remark correctly positions it as the energy counterpart to Theorem 3.2's momentum jump. The discrete analog P=F·v → J·v̄ is physically transparent and pedagogically valuable.

**Red (skeptic):** No objection. The remark is compact, mathematically sound, and correctly contrasts with the corner case. The corner/impulse dichotomy summary provides useful structural closure for Section 3.
