# Q166 — Plan

Referee review of C282 (Remark 4.3g in relativistic paper).

Review criteria:
1. Mathematical correctness: Verify l_SR = GM/c from L>K/c with K=GMm and ℓ=L/m. Verify l_ISCO = 2√3 GM/c from L_ISCO=2√3 M in G=c=1. Confirm ratio = 2√3 ≈ 3.46.
2. Unit consistency: SR Section 3 uses L (with mass dimension), GR Section 4 uses l (specific, G=c=1). Is the unit conversion handled correctly?
3. Placement: Does the remark belong after Remark 4.3f?
4. Cross-references: Is the reference to Section 3.1 and Remark 4.3b accurate?
5. No cycle labels in manuscript text.
