# S148 Red Team: Casimir effect blackboard

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Zeta function argument: blackboard said ζ_H(-1/2), correct value is ζ(-3). Avoided by not specifying the argument in the promoted remark — just stating "zeta-function regularization" among the methods.
- Notation collision: "d" for both plate separation and spatial dimension. Avoided in promoted remark by using only the physical setup (3D plates).
