# S230 — Plan: Weierstrass excess function for free particle

Remark 4.3b establishes Jacobi sufficiency (weak minimum). The Weierstrass
excess function E(ẋ,ẋ') = m/2 (ẋ'-ẋ)² ≥ 0 upgrades this to strong
minimality: competitors need only be C⁰-close, not C¹-close. The kinked
trajectory from Section 4.3 is exactly such a strong competitor.
