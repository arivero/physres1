# S253 — Execution
Verified: Theorem 3.1's momentum continuity (Weierstrass-Erdmann condition)
is the flat-space analog of the tangent-continuity condition for broken
geodesics. Synge's world function σ(x,y) = ½d²(x,y) plays the role of
the action, and ∂²σ/∂x∂y is the Van Vleck determinant (Remark 4.5a).

The parallel is exact and mathematically clean. However:
1. Paper scope is distributional/functional-analytic, not geometric.
2. No "geodesic" or "Synge" or "Riemannian" appears in the cornerstone.
3. Paper is at 7pp (over PLB limit).
4. Outlook item 3 already points to this direction.

NOT PROMOTED. Outlook item 3 is sufficient as-is.
