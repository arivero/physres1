# Q141 — Debate

## Why rewrite instead of fix the formula?
The dimensional analysis of half-density reference choices is genuinely subtle.
The formula σ_* = (constant)|dx|^{1/2} mixes geometric objects (|dx|^{1/2})
with physical dimensions (α), and getting the exponents right requires more
care than a short Example can provide without derailing the paper's flow.

The rewritten version focuses on what matters: κ/α = 1 is dimensionless and
RG-invariant, which IS the concrete content of "RG invariants supply scalarization
scales." The σ_* construction is left implicit, consistent with Section 5's
stated approach ("organizing perspective, not a theorem").
