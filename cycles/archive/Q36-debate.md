# Q36 Debate: Should σ-Finite Be in the Intro?

## Question
Does mentioning "\(\sigma\)-finite" in `Heuristic H0.2a` add too much technicality to the Introduction?

## Current Resolution
Keep it: the term is short, prevents pathological counterexamples, and the heuristic immediately translates it into the operational moral ("`Dq` is formal; refinement is definitional").
