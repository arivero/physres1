# S187 Debate: QND Measurement Blackboard

## Key Outcomes

### Dual QND Conditions
QND requires BOTH [A, H_sys] = 0 (action is conserved) AND [A, H_int] = 0 (measurement interaction preserves action). Single commutator is insufficient for true QND.

### Back-Action Semantics
Back-action is not absent in QND; it is redirected to the conjugate variable (e.g., momentum if measuring position). This is the operative distinction from standard measurements.

### Cavity-QED Implementation
Rydberg atoms in dispersive cavity-QED with Ramsey interferometry enable QND readout of atomic populations (adiabatic Stark shift). Nogues et al. (1999) is the canonical reference.

### Zeno vs. QND
Zeno effect (frequent collapse-based measurement) and QND (continuous non-invasive coupling) are conceptually orthogonal. Both suppress decoherence but through different mechanisms.

## Consensus
All corrections are experimentally grounded and clarify measurement physics. Ready for promotion.
