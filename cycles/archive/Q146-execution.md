# Q146 — Execution: Referee review of C261

## Verdict: PASS

All math correct:
- E²(6M) = 16/18 = 8/9 ✓
- E = 2√2/3 ≈ 0.9428 ✓
- η = 1 - 2√2/3 ≈ 5.72% ✓
- Physical interpretation (thin-disk accretion efficiency) standard and accurate
- SR contrast (no ISCO → no efficiency bound) correct

No HIGH or MEDIUM issues. Two LOW: (1) could cite Page & Thorne 1974, (2)
Kerr comparison omitted (acceptable — paper focuses on Schwarzschild).
