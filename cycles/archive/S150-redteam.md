# S150 Red Team: EFT refinement hierarchy blackboard

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Wilson date: blackboard said 1969, correct is early 1970s. Fixed by citing Weinberg 1979 as primary EFT reference.
- EFT remark is somewhat conceptual (less computational than other remarks). Mitigated by including concrete content: operator expansion with dimensional analysis, Wilson coefficients, Warsaw basis.
