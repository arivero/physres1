# B33 Debate

## Hard question
Should we cite the specific theorem numbers (IX.3.1, II.3.6) in the manuscript, or leave the references generic as "standard convergence theory"?

## Current resolution
For now, leave the manuscript text generic ("standard convergence theory"). The bibliography entries record the specific theorems in their annotation. If a future referee requests explicit theorem citations, we can add them as parenthetical notes. The current remark-level statement doesn't require theorem-number precision.
