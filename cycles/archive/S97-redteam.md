## Failure modes
1. **Overlap with cornerstone**: Theorems 2.1, 3.1, 3.2 restate P3.1–P3.4 from the cornerstone Section 5. Mitigation: the satellite provides explicit hypotheses (H1–H3), full proofs, and a worked model that the cornerstone omits. The value-add is in the detail, not the claim.
2. **Worked model too simple**: The delta-kick free particle is elementary. Mitigation: simplicity is the point — the model is meant to illustrate the formalism cleanly, not to produce a new physical result.
3. **Missing references**: The note cites only 3 references. Could add Hormander for distribution theory, or specific variational texts. Low priority — references can grow in B cycles.
