# S88 Debate

## Hard question
Should the vulnerability statement be fully removed now that 10.5 exists?
## Resolution
No. The vulnerability should be softened, not removed. 10.5 is a QM computation — it demonstrates the full RG machinery (divergence, subtraction, running, transmutation) but in a quantum-mechanical setting, not a field-theory one. The honest self-assessment is: "an explicit computation is provided (Section 10.5), but the extension to full QFT remains future work." This is stronger than "no computation at all" but weaker than "fully demonstrated."
