# S270 Plan: Main-paper threshold bridge derivation draft

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Produce a compact, promotion-ready derivation of the central-force threshold rule \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\) for use in `paper/main.md`.

## Deliverable
- Target: one concise technical note with assumptions, derivation, and manuscript-facing phrasing.
- Output file:
  - `paper/notes/main-paper-threshold-bridge.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S270-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Derivation clearly separates asymptotic threshold logic from the independent \(q=2\) dimensional identity.
- At least one command check logged.
- Promotion candidate sentence drafted.
