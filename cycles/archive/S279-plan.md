# S279 Plan: Blackboard-to-notebook consolidation for threshold thread

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Use blackboard and notebook layers explicitly for the active threshold thread.

## Deliverables
- Write branchboard snapshot in `blackboards/3.md`.
- Promote stabilized subset into `notebooks/central-force-threshold-bridge.md`.
- Keep branchboard and notebook role separation explicit.

## Acceptance criteria
- Blackboard contains branch menu and active caveats.
- Notebook contains only stabilized statements/diagnostics/process gates.

## Policy addendum (session rule)
- This cycle aligns with the new rule by operating in `blackboards/` and `notebooks/`, not `paper/notes/`.
