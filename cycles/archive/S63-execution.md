# S63 Execution: RCP as an Explicit Compatibility Diagram (Toy Family Witness)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Work performed
- Wrote a compact “compatibility diagram” formulation of RCP as a closure requirement on a family \(\{\mathcal O_{h,\theta}\}\) under three operations (\(\mathcal C,\mathcal Q,\mathcal R\)) with explicit parameter-update maps \(\tau\).
- Added a concrete toy-family witness: the free Gaussian short-time kernel semigroup forces the normalization exponent \(h^{-d/2}\) (half-density exponent), showing closure can fail for inconsistent conventions.

## Artifacts produced
- `blackboards/2026-02-11-rcp-compatibility-diagram-toy-family.md`

## Promotion candidate
The blackboard note includes a copyable promotion block intended for `C90` insertion into `paper/main.md` (RCP appendix), making the “compatibility principle” operational and falsifiable.
