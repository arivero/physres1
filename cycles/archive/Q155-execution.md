# Q155 — Execution

Verified all claims:
1. ω_φ²=M/r₀³ from L²=Mr₀²/(r₀-3M), E²=(r₀-2M)²/(r₀(r₀-3M)): algebra checked ✓
2. Proper-time factor dτ/dt=√((r₀-3M)/r₀)=√(1-3M/r₀) from metric ✓
3. ISCO check: √(1-1/2)=1/√2≈0.707 ✓
4. "Gauge accident" characterization: coordinate-dependent simplification, justified ✓
5. Cross-references to Remarks 4.3a–e all present and correct ✓
6. Page count: 262 lines, 5pp, within budget ✓

Verdict: **PASS**. All derivations correct. Optional: "coordinate artifact"
slightly more precise than "gauge accident" but acceptable as written.
