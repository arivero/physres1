# Q22 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5h

## Goal
Referee-style check after adding non-planar caution D1.5h.

## Checks
1. Read D1.5b-h as a single progression.
2. Verify D1.5h stays cautionary and does not imply full non-planar dynamics treatment.
3. Guardrail scan on `paper/main.md` for cycle-label leakage.

## Acceptance Tests
- Sequence remains coherent with explicit assumption boundaries.
- No manuscript fixes needed, or fixes applied if required.
