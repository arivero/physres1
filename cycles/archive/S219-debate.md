# S219 — Debate: dirac-probes Section 5.2 expansion

## Q: Should the expansion include full derivations?
**A:** No — this is a PLB satellite. The detailed derivations live in delta-objects
(Example 4.1, Remark 4.2, Remark 4.3). Section 5.2 should state the result and
cross-reference.

## Q: Is the d/2 connection to path-integral normalization overclaiming?
**A:** No — it's a precise mathematical statement. The heat kernel K(t;x,x) has
the same t^{-d/2} singularity that normalizes the path integral. The Laplace
transform G = ∫K dt inherits this exponent.
