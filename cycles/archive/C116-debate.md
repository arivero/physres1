# C116 Debate: Should PA-E5b mention the resolvent vs time-domain distinction?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The Lippmann–Schwinger factorization G = G₀ + G₀·T·G₀ is a resolvent (energy-domain) identity. The time-domain version involves a convolution. Should the remark note this distinction?

## Recommendation
No. The structural point (T is a scalar at the vertex, G₀ carries half-density weight) holds in the resolvent picture, which is the natural one for the 2D delta. The time-domain convolution is more complex but preserves the same factorization type. Mentioning the distinction would add technical detail without changing the conclusion. Keep the remark clean.
