## Failure Modes
1. The delta/stationary-phase addendum reads like a theorem about limits of oscillatory integrals rather than a weight comparison.
2. The section starts to feel like a semiclassical-analysis mini-review.

## Mitigations
- If needed, trim D3.5a to the minimal identity + one sentence about square roots.
- Defer multi-dimensional determinant discussion to `paper/notes/` (already done in `paper/notes/van-vleck-schur-complement.md`).
