# S155 Debate: Gutzwiller trace formula

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- The trace formula connects quantum eigenvalues to classical periodic orbits — the non-integrable counterpart of EBK.
- Underlies both Berry-Tabor (Poisson) and BGS (random matrix) spectral statistics.
- Maslov index appears again as topological control data, same as in WKB/EBK.
