# C51 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. Draft is only an outline (no derivations).
2. Drift into GR details without completing the SR baseline first.
3. Overclaiming physical significance (“dimension selection proved”) from a kinematic bound.

## Mitigations
1. Require at least one boxed SR derivation (done).
2. Keep GR as “next wave” only.
3. Frame as a witness/constraint, not a proof of any selection principle.
