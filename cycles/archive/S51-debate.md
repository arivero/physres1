# S51 Debate: Mention the 2D Contact RG in the Intro or Keep It Later?

## Question
Should the Introduction's divergence witness be the 2D contact-interaction beta function (stronger but more specific), or the derivative-as-counterterm toy model (weaker but universal)?

## Current Resolution
Use the toy calculus witness in the Introduction and keep the 2D contact beta function as the later concrete computation (already advertised in the Contributions list).
