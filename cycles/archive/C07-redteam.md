## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. The path-integral measure remains formal; section 9 labels this but does not resolve constructive existence.
2. Deformation-equivalence claims are structural; explicit operator-domain proofs are deferred.
3. RG treatment is consistency-level, not a full loop-computation benchmark in a specific QFT.
4. Truncation closure caveat is explicit, but no quantitative truncation-error control is provided.

## Evidence Needed
1. Add one appendical worked renormalization computation to ground beta-function discussion in a concrete model.
2. Add one explicit discretization-pair computation showing matching classical limit and shifted \(O(\hbar)\) terms.
3. Add one foundational-principle appendix that states compatibility axioms across partition, representation, and scale.

## Next Steps Beyond Roadmap
1. Convert manuscript to TeX with numbered theorem environments and equation cross-references.
2. Add one figure showing the refinement/compatibility chain as a commutative-style diagram.
3. Add appendices for technical proofs currently summarized in main text.

## Closed Items
1. Transition assumptions are now explicit rather than implicit.
2. Proven-vs-heuristic boundary is documented in the manuscript, not only in cycle logs.
3. Roadmap `C00` through `C07` is now internally complete.
