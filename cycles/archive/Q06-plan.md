# Q06 Plan

## Goal
Quick referee-style pass on `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` after the C38 convention/sign fix to ensure:
1. the 3D loop-integral convention is consistent across §5.8.1 and §5.9,
2. no downstream formula still assumes the old sign,
3. the change did not introduce new ambiguity about \(T\)-matrix normalization.

## Scope
1. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` (read-only in this cycle).
2. Record findings/action items in `cycles/Q06-execution.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `cycles/Q06-execution.md` lists actionable edits tagged by cycle type.
2. No manuscript edits performed in this cycle.
