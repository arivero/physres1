# S63 Red Team: Risks in the RCP Compatibility-Diagram Blackboard

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Diagram is purely notational (no constraint):
  - Mitigation: include a toy family where closure forces a concrete exponent/normalization.
- The example is too technical for its payoff:
  - Mitigation: keep the witness to the shortest possible Gaussian-kernel semigroup computation; no extra machinery.
- Overpromising generality:
  - Mitigation: label the diagram as an operational *schema*; state explicitly that each compatibility has its own domain of applicability.
