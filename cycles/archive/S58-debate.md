# S58 Debate: Is \(\tau_b\) "Physical" or Just a Convention?

## Question
If \(\tau_b\) depends on the comparison rule, does it carry physical content?

## Current Resolution
\(\tau_b\) is scheme-dependent, but the *need* for a control map (closure failure vs closure success) is structural.
Within reasonable schemes, invariant data are expected to include fixed points, stability, universal exponents, and RG-invariant scale combinations.
