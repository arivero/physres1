# C247 — Debate

## Hard question
Does the remark warrant a separate label (4.3), or should it be
merged into Remark 4.2?

## Resolution
Separate label is appropriate because:
1. It makes a specific quantitative claim (convergence condition).
2. It connects two different sections (2 and 4).
3. The parent Remark 4.2 is already quite long (one substantial
   paragraph). Adding more would make it unwieldy.
