## Failure modes
### 1. Feynman-Hibbs is old
- Risk: 1965 edition, no recent treatment cited.
- Mitigation: the paper's "toy model" is standard Riemann integration + action principle. Feynman-Hibbs is the foundational reference for the time-slicing picture. Modern treatments (e.g., Zinn-Justin, Kleinert) add rigor but not different content for this note's scope.
