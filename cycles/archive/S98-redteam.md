## Failure modes
1. **"This is just the standard time-slicing derivation"**: True, but the framing through impulse-matching theorems is the value-add.
2. **Half-density prefactor claim needs more backing**: The section states the prefactor is "precisely the half-density normalization" but does not derive it. Acceptable as a pointer to the cornerstone's detailed treatment.
