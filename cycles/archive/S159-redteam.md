# S159 Red Team: Anomalous magnetic moment

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Schwinger pair production date corrected (1951, not 1948 — different paper).
- Higher-order coefficients avoided (some disputed between sources).
- Muon g-2 status updated to reflect lattice QCD agreement (as of 2025-2026).
- Remark numbering: old Remark 3.3 became 3.4. No internal cross-references affected.
