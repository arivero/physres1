# Q78 Debate: Referee pass on C122

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is the remark too dense for its location?

## Resolution
Section 3.1 is already dense with hypothesis labels. The remark follows the same pattern and adds a summary that readers tracking the hypothesis chain will need. The density is appropriate for the context.
