# Q05 Plan

## Goal
Referee-style pass on `papers/delta-objects/main.md` after the \(\delta(f')\) vs \(\delta'\) clarifier, to ensure:
1. the draft stays concise and does not conflate distinct delta constructions,
2. the weak Euler–Lagrange remark is accurate (no overclaim about rigor/order of distributions),
3. the half-density message remains the organizing spine.

## Scope
1. `papers/delta-objects/main.md` (read-only in this cycle).
2. Record findings/action items in `cycles/Q05-execution.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `cycles/Q05-execution.md` lists actionable edits tagged by cycle type.
2. No manuscript edits performed in this cycle.
