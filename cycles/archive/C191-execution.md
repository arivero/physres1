# C191 Execution: Promote EFT remark to uncuttable

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Inserted Remark 4.4 after Remark 4.3 (lattice gauge theory), before closing paragraph of Section 4.
2. Content: EFT as systematic refinement hierarchy — operator expansion L_EFT = Σ(c_i/Λ^{d_i-4})O_i, matching conditions at thresholds as "comparison across refinements," Wilson coefficients as extra data, SM as EFT with Warsaw basis dimension-6 operators.
3. Built PDF: 9 pages, 155 lines (+3).
