# C80 Debate: Does the ODE Witness Belong in Section 8 or Earlier?

## Question
Should the explicit step-halving \(\tau\) witness appear in Section 8 (renormalization), or earlier near time-slicing/ordering discussions?

## Current Resolution
Keep it in Section 8.4: it is a refinement-control witness (scale comparison) and aligns with the RG narrative; ordering ambiguity already has a separate witness in the Introduction.
