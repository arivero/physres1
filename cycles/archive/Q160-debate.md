# Q160 Debate

**Pro**: The remark provides essential mathematical grounding for why δ² cannot be defined, connects cleanly to QFT UV divergences, and completes the table's conceptual hierarchy.

**Con**: A reader unfamiliar with distribution theory might want a concrete citation to Schwartz's original theorem (e.g., *Théorie des distributions*, 1950-51). Hormander2003 is cited elsewhere but not explicitly invoked for the Schwartz impossibility claim.

**Resolution**: The remark is mathematically correct and pedagogically effective. Adding a direct Schwartz citation would strengthen it, but the current form is acceptable given Hormander2003 is listed in the bibliography.
