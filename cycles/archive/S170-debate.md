# S170 — Debate

## Summary
The mathematical-physicist reviewer's four corrections were all valid
and well-targeted:

- The UV/IR renormalon distinction is standard (see e.g. Beneke 1999)
  and the original slip would have been embarrassing in print.
- The sign convention error was a transcription mistake from the
  Bender–Wu formula; removing the spurious factor restores agreement
  with the original papers.
- Replacing vague "factorial growth" with the precise $A^{-n}\,\Gamma(n+b)$
  form is essential for any reader who wants to check the claim.
- Both BW 1969 and BW 1973 are needed: the 1973 paper introduces the
  logarithmic corrections that are central to the trans-series story.

No disagreements. All corrections incorporated before promotion in C211.
