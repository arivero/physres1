# S45 Debate: Does This Need a Bibliography Cycle Now?

## Question
Should we open a bibliography cycle to anchor Wilson-loop/string-tension lore before promoting any mention of \(\sigma\)?

## Current Resolution
Not yet. Promote only the logical separation statement (UV parameter vs RG-emergent invariant) without making load-bearing claims about confinement diagnostics. Open a `B` cycle only if we expand beyond one remark.
