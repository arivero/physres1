# S208 — Execution

## What was done
1. Identified the Padé [0/1] recovery of Yukawa pole from two contact
   coefficients as the cleanest worked example for question #4.
2. Verified with SymPy: P[0/1](C₀,C₂) = g²/(q²+M²) exactly.
3. Connected to loop-level: vacuum polarization branch cut recoverable
   via dispersion relations (moment problem) or Padé accumulation.
4. Connected to the uncuttable paper's Borel resummation theme.
5. Overwrote blackboard slot 6 (was squeezed states, promoted via C171).

## Blackboard
Slot 6: "Non-Perturbative Content of the Contact Expansion"

## Open question #4 status
Partially addressed. Concrete tree-level example provided. Loop-level
(Borel–Padé of vacuum polarization) remains open.
