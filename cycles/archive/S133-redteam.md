# S133 Red Team: Wigner function and sub-Planck structure

Date: 2026-02-13

## Attack vectors
1. **Laguerre argument error**: Original blackboard had 4H/ℏω instead of 2H/ℏω.
   Caught by reviewer, fixed before promotion.
2. **Sub-Planck ambiguity**: Could be confused with Planck-scale physics.
   Manuscript uses "finer than the minimal uncertainty cell" instead.
3. **Scope creep**: Wigner function is a large topic. Risk of bloating the remark.
   Mitigated by keeping to ~3 sentences focused on the Husimi complement angle.
