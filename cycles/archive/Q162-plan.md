# Q162 Plan: Review C278 (Remark 4.5c on Trotter formula)

## Scope
Referee review of C278's insertion of Remark 4.5c into `papers/dirac-probes-corners-impulses/main.md`.

## Review Checklist
1. **Mathematical correctness**: Verify the Trotter-Kato connection to the time-slicing discussion is accurate. Check that the description of alternating free propagator with potential phase kick matches the standard Trotter product formula.

2. **Placement**: Confirm Remark 4.5c appears after Remark 4.5b and before Section 5, as expected in the logical flow of Section 4.5.

3. **Cross-references**: Validate the mention of "companion refinement note (Remark 3.3 there)" by checking that the uncuttable paper indeed has Remark 3.3 on the Trotter formula.

4. **No cycle labels**: Scan for cycle tags like `C00` in the manuscript text.

5. **No duplication**: Ensure the remark is appropriately brief since the uncuttable paper's Remark 3.3 already provides the detailed treatment.

## Expected Outcome
PASS, CONDITIONAL PASS (with fix), or FAIL verdict with detailed justification.
