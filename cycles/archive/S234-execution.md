# S234 — Execution

Derived the general impulse-Noether theorem:
1. On each smooth segment, Noether's theorem gives dQ/dt = 0 for Q = (∂L/∂q̇)·ξ.
2. Across impulse J·δ(t-t₀), Theorem 3.2 gives Δ(∂L/∂q̇) = J.
3. Since q is continuous at t₀, ΔQ = J·ξ(q(t₀)).
4. Conservation criterion: J·ξ = 0 (impulse perpendicular to symmetry direction).

Special case (Section 4.4): rotational symmetry ξ=(-y,x), radial impulse J=J_r r̂,
so J·ξ = J_r(r̂·(-y,x)/r) = 0 since r̂⊥θ̂ and ξ ∝ r θ̂. Angular momentum preserved.

Target: Remark 4.4a, +3 lines after Section 4.4 paragraph.
