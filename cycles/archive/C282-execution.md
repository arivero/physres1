# C282 — Execution
Inserted Remark 4.3g (SR→GR angular-momentum floor ratio) after
Remark 4.3f in relativistic. +3 lines.

The remark compares l_SR = GM/c (Section 3.1) with l_ISCO = 2√3 GM/c
(Remark 4.3b). Ratio 2√3 ≈ 3.46 is a pure number quantifying the
curvature-induced tightening, paralleling the 1/6 precession ratio.
