# S197: Execution — Feynman-Kac formula
**Date:** 2026-02-13
Wrote blackboard 1.md: Feynman-Kac formula, Cameron's theorem (no Minkowski measure), Wiener measure as genuine σ-additive measure, connection to Trotter (Remark 3.3), Itô (Remark 3.2), and constructive QFT (Remark 4.11). Reviewed by mathematical physicist: HIGH — fix potential condition (V bounded below, not V≥0); HIGH — change "derived from" to "proved using" for Trotter relationship; MEDIUM — consider adding Kac 1951; MEDIUM — clarify Cameron 1960 journal name. All corrections applied in C238.
