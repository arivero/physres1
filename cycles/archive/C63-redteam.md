# C63 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Formula opacity:** readers see \(\Sigma\), \(J\) but no interpretation.
2. **False certainty:** linear propagation treated as definitive in nonlinear regimes.
3. **Section creep:** uncertainty note grows into methods section.

## Mitigations
1. Keep formulas tied to named observables (\(q,\mathcal T_{\mathbf n}\)).
2. Include explicit nonlinear cross-check caveat.
3. Keep note short and defer details to blackboards/future appendices.
