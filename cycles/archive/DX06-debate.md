# DX06 Debate

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Should the main paper be updated to explicitly reference PA-D1.4a (composition forces d/2)?

## Resolution
No. The main paper's Section 6 (D4.0–D4.1a) already establishes half-density composition as a structural requirement. PA-D1.4a adds a specific free-propagator witness, which belongs in the companion note (where it now lives). The main paper should stay self-contained; the companion pointer at line 544 is sufficient.
