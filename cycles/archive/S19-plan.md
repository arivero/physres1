# S19 Plan: Invariant Conformal-Rescaling Formula for the Half-Density Laplacian

## Goal
Strengthen H2.6a by moving from the “\(g=e^{2\sigma}\delta\)” computation to a coordinate-free conformal-rescaling statement:
for \(g=e^{2\sigma}\bar g\), derive the transformation of
\[
\widetilde\Delta_g:=|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g|g|^{-1/4}
\]
and show the \(|\nabla\sigma|^2\) term carries the universal coefficient \(D(4-D)/4\), hence cancels at \(D=4\) for any base metric \(\bar g\) (still within the conformal class).

## Scope
- One blackboard note with:
  - derivation using the standard conformal transformation of \(\Delta_g\) on scalars,
  - explicit display of the \(|\nabla\sigma|^2\) coefficient,
  - short discussion of what this does (and does not) prove about “dimension selection”.
- No promotion into manuscripts in this cycle.

## Acceptance Tests
1. The note contains a boxed conformal-rescaling identity for \(\widetilde\Delta\) with the \(D(4-D)/4\) coefficient.
2. The note explicitly states: “this is stronger than conformal-to-flat, but still restricted to conformal changes; it is a heuristic filter candidate.”
3. If a symbolic check is used, record command + output (optional).
