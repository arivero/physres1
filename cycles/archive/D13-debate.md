# D13 Debate: Post-promotion housekeeping after `S67 → C99 → Q56`

Date: 2026-02-11

## Hard question
Should we run an optional micro `C100` to unify the elementary-differential notation, or keep it bundled with the next substantive promotion wave?

## Current resolution
Keep it bundled unless it becomes a recurring confusion point; the witness is already readable after C99 and Q56 found no required follow-ups.
