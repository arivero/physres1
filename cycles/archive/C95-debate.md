# C95 Debate: Keep reader-map symbols vs drop them

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Should the Section 2.5 reader map show the operator symbols \(\mathcal C_t,\mathcal Q_\hbar,\mathcal R_\Lambda\) before the formal definitions in Appendix 10.3?

## Options
1. Keep symbols and add a minimal pointer to Appendix 10.3 for definitions.
2. Drop symbols in Section 2.5 and keep them only where defined later.

## Decision
Option 1.

## Rationale
The symbols provide continuity with the later RCP summary, and a small “definitions in Appendix 10.3” pointer prevents early-symbol friction without weakening the navigation block.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- If reader testing shows the symbols still distract, consider a future `C` to remove them from the early map (keeping the verbal labels).
