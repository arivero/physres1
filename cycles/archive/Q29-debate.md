# Q29 Debate: Should H1.8a Mention 3D Scope Explicitly?

## Question
Should H1.8a include an explicit qualifier that the 3D statement is for the s-wave contact branch only?

## Current Resolution
Current wording ("3D s-wave contact reduction") is sufficient and already present; no extra sentence needed unless future expansions add multichannel/partial-wave detail.
