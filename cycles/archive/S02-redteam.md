## Failure Modes
1. Category error: confusing geometric density weights with scaling/anomalous dimensions.
2. Overclaim: treating a representational choice as a physical observable.
3. Conflation: mixing half-density scalarization (finite-dimensional kernel composition) with QFT path-integral measure issues without a clean bridge.

## Mitigations
- Keep the baseline half-density statements purely geometric.
- Mark any QFT parallels as heuristic until a concrete computation supports them.
- Extract only small promotion candidates that survive this discipline.
