# S152 Execution: Number-phase uncertainty

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 0 on Susskind-Glogower operators and number-phase uncertainty.
2. Reviewer (quantum optics theorist) found multiple operator-algebra errors:
   - Operator ordering: should be â(N+1)^{-1/2}, not (N+1)^{-1/2}â. Fixed.
   - Product identities flipped: E₊E₋ = I and E₋E₊ = I - |0⟩⟨0| (with E₊ raising). Fixed.
   - "Wrapping" comment for angular momentum at boundaries: misleading. Omitted.
   - Commutators [N, E₊] and Pegg-Barnett limit: both correct.
3. Promoted as Remark 2.1 with corrected operator algebra.
