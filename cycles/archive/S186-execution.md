# S186 Execution: Dipole Selection Rules Blackboard

## Blackboard Written
Created `/Users/arivero/physarticle/blackboards/0-dipole-selection-rules.md` on azimuthal Fourier orthogonality, polar Δl structure, and photon angular momentum.

## Subagent Review
Launched atomic physicist persona (Task tool). Reviewer identified 8 issues:
- **HIGH (1):** Missing explicit Δl = ±1 rule derivation from polar integral / Clebsch-Gordan coupling.
- **MEDIUM (2):**
  - Angular momentum sign convention in z-component (clarify ℏ vs. ℏm).
  - π-photon carries zero z-component, not ℏ (correct misconception).
- **LOW (5):** Notation consistency, Zeeman example completeness, cross-reference anchoring.

## Corrections Applied
All 8 issues resolved:
- Expanded polar integral section to include Δl = ±1 derivation.
- Corrected photon angular momentum language (qℏ z-component, π-photon q=0).
- Strengthened Zeeman example and notation consistency.

## Status
Blackboard finalized, ready for C227 promotion.
