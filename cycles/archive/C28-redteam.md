## Failure Modes
1. Over-formalizing “theory space” and losing the narrative.
2. Introducing ambiguity by mentioning field-normalization conventions without stating what is fixed.
3. Repeating too much of the blackboard note in the manuscript.

## Mitigations
- Keep it to one labeled heuristic plus one paragraph.
- Phrase the rule operationally (what is excluded; what is allowed).
- Do not add new hypotheses beyond what is needed to keep H2.5 meaningful.
