# B03 Debate: Avoiding “Herd” Citations While Still Anchoring Claims

## Question
How do we cite dimension-dependent Coulomb/Kepler scaling without turning the paper into a PDE textbook?

## Current Resolution
Use one clean OA reference that explicitly states the “potential = fundamental solution of Laplacian” logic and records the \(n\)-dependence and \(n=2\) exception, and keep the manuscript text derivation-first and short.

For minimal-length/GUP, use a single high-level review as a signpost (branch tracker), not as an argument driver.
