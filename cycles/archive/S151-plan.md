# S151 Plan: Cooper pairing as emergent bosonic mediator

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study Cooper pairing — fermion bilinears forming bosonic condensates that can source classical fields — as the canonical resolution of the fermionic obstruction in Section 3.

## Steps
1. Write blackboard 0: Cooper instability, BCS gap, order parameter, Anderson-Higgs/Meissner, BEC-BCS crossover.
2. Launch reviewer subagent (condensed matter / BCS expert persona).
3. Incorporate corrections and promote to Remark 6.1 in fermionic mediators Section 6.
