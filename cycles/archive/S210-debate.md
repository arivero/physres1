# S210 — Debate

## Hard question
Is the "anomaly = composition-law defect" framing genuinely new, or just
Fujikawa's derivation stated in different words?

## Resolution
It is largely Fujikawa restated in the half-density language. The
genuine contribution is locating the anomaly WITHIN the composition
structure (the sewing operation), rather than in the abstract "measure."
This connects to the project's central theme but does not produce
new physics. The honest verdict is: conceptual reframing, not discovery.

## Hard question 2
Should we force a promotion into HD-QFT §7?

## Resolution
No. HD-QFT is at 234 lines (4pp), already at the PLB boundary. Forcing
a weak remark would dilute the paper's sharp message ("half-densities
make QFT kernel semantics canonical"). The anomaly connection is better
left as outlook/future work.
