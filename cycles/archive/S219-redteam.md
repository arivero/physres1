# S219 — Red Team: dirac-probes Section 5.2 expansion

## Attack 1: "This duplicates delta-objects content"
**Response:** No — the dirac-probes remark focuses on the bridge between
path-integral normalization (Section 4.5) and renormalization thresholds.
Delta-objects focuses on the kernel-level structure. They complement.

## Attack 2: "The Morrey embedding statement is too technical"
**Response:** It's one line and provides the mathematical reason why d≥4
has no extension. The PLB audience expects mathematical precision.

## Verdict: Low-risk expansion that fills the thinnest section.
