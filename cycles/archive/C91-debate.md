# C91 Debate: Rename operators or add a minimal mapping sentence?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
To address notation drift between `Proposition P10.1` and `Derivation D10.1a`, should we rename the indexed operators to match the schematic ones, or keep the current indexed notation and add a short mapping sentence?

## Options
1. Rename \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\to\mathcal C_t\), \(\mathcal Q_\alpha\to\mathcal Q_\hbar\), \(\mathcal R_b\to\mathcal R_\Lambda\) throughout D10.1a (more uniform, but risks obscuring what the indices mean).
2. Keep the indexed notation and add a one-paragraph bridge that maps schematic \(\mathcal C_t,\mathcal Q_\hbar,\mathcal R_\Lambda\) to \(\mathcal C_{b,h},\mathcal Q_\alpha,\mathcal R_b\) and defines the indices.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
The indices \((b,h,\alpha)\) are informative (refinement factor, ruler, representation choice). A minimal bridge preserves this while preventing reader confusion.
