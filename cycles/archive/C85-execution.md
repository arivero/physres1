# C85 Execution: Concrete Witness for \(c\) as a Control Parameter (Rest-Energy Subtraction)

## Work
- Added `Derivation D0.2` in `paper/main.md` showing:
  - the relativistic action expands as \(-mc^2(t_f-t_i)+\int \frac12 m v^2 dt+O(c^{-2})\),
  - the naive \(c\to\infty\) limit is divergent unless an additive subtraction convention is specified,
  - subtracting the rest-energy term is an allowed counterterm (classically inert; quantum-global-phase).
- Added a pointer in `Heuristic H0.3` to the concrete witness.

## Result
The manuscript now contains a concrete, limit-control example for \(c\), parallel in spirit to the "derivative as renormalized limit" witness for refinement divergences.
