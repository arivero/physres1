# S55 Debate: Put the "Constants as Control Parameters" Heuristic in the Intro?

## Question
Should the cornerstone manuscript explicitly say "why \(\hbar\), \(c\), \(G\)" in the Introduction, or keep that as a dependent note/paper?

## Current Resolution
Add one short heuristic block only if it stays tightly tied to the existing refinement/compatibility spine and does not balloon into a new topic.
Otherwise keep it as a dependent follow-up note.
