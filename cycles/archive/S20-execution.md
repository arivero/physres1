# S20 Execution: `conv_patched.md` Coverage Map

## Work Completed
- Read `conv_patched.md` as a non-citable idea log and extracted the major themes by segment.
- Created a durable gap/placement map:
  - `docs/conv-coverage-map.md`
- Updated roadmap and logs to reflect new “outside scope” candidates and their best integration points.

## Result
We now have a restart-stable, file-targeted list of which conversation themes remain outside the current paper set, and where they should be incorporated (or spun out) with clear `S`/`C`/`B` next steps.
