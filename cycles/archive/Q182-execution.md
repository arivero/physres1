# Q182 Execution: Referee pass on C299 threshold-bridge insertion

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C299`

## Findings
- PASS.
- The asymptotic derivation logic is correct at remark level: with fixed \(L\), \(p\sim L/r\), barrier \(\sim r^{-\nu}\), attraction \(\sim r^{-(q-1)}\), yielding threshold \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\).
- Scope boundary is stated explicitly, preventing overclaim against full global orbit classification.
- Narrative placement is appropriate: it remains a short bridge attached to Section 3.3 rather than a detour.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- None required.

## Notes (non-actions)
- If later readability compression is needed, this remark can be split into one formula sentence plus one scope sentence without changing content.
