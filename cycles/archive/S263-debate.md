# S263 — Debate

## Core question
Which third Outlook item best complements the existing two (field-mediated
interaction; refinement-compatibility spine)?

## For candidate (a) — Sommerfeld/quantum connection

**Pro:**
- The orbit equation with omega^2 = 1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2) is literally the
  starting point of Sommerfeld's 1916 derivation. The connection is not
  analogical — it is mathematical identity.
- The direction (classical SR orbits -> quantum energy levels) is orthogonal
  to items 1 (classical -> field theory) and 2 (classical -> refinement spine).
  Three orthogonal directions make a well-rounded Outlook.
- It connects to the project's overarching thesis: refinement from classical
  to quantum mechanics. The cornerstone paper's spine runs through exactly
  this transition.
- The bound L > K/c (Section 3.1) becomes, upon quantization, n_phi > Z alpha.
  For hydrogen (Z=1, alpha ~ 1/137), this is easily satisfied, but for
  superheavy atoms (Z alpha ~ 1) it becomes the well-known "fall to center"
  problem — a direct physical consequence of the paper's admissibility bound.

**Con:**
- The Sommerfeld connection is well-known to specialists in atomic physics
  history. It is not a new observation.
- The paper currently has no quantum content. Adding a quantum Outlook item
  could feel like scope creep.
- Sommerfeld's formula agrees with Dirac's only to order (Z alpha)^4; the
  spin-orbit and Darwin terms break the degeneracy at higher order. The
  Outlook item must not overclaim.

**Assessment:** The "well-known" objection is valid but irrelevant for an
Outlook pointer — the purpose is to indicate a direction, not to claim
novelty. The scope-creep objection is mitigated by the fact that this paper
is a satellite of a project whose entire thesis is the classical-to-quantum
chain.

## Against candidate (b) — Post-Newtonian

The PN expansion question is valid but less sharp than (a). It also overlaps
with Outlook item 2: the PN hierarchy *is* a refinement hierarchy (each PN
order includes more relativistic corrections). So item 2 arguably subsumes (b).

## Against candidate (c) — Multi-body

The SR two-body problem is a genuine open direction, but it requires machinery
(no-interaction theorem, Breit equation) that is too far from the paper's
content. An Outlook item should grow naturally from the paper's results;
this one would feel grafted.

## Against candidate (d) — Experimental

The 1/6 fraction of GR precession is not independently measurable for
gravitational orbits (where GR dominates). For Coulomb orbits, the
classical SR precession is embedded in the quantum fine structure and
cannot be isolated. This direction leads to either the Sommerfeld
connection (reducing to candidate a) or to speculative macroscopic setups.

## Verdict
Candidate (a) is the strongest by a clear margin. The mathematical identity
between the paper's orbit equation and Sommerfeld's starting point is a
concrete, verifiable fact that points forward to a real research direction
(semiclassical quantization of refinement-witness bounds). Draft text is
ready for C-cycle promotion.
