# S207 — Debate

## Hard question
Is this a negative result? "RCP doesn't add new constraints" sounds
like the question has been answered in the negative.

## Resolution
Not entirely negative. The Level 1 conceptual gain is real: the
cornerstone paper's thesis is that RCP *explains* known structures,
not that it *predicts new ones*. Showing that contact universality
is an instance of composition-law consistency strengthens the thesis.

The Levels 2–3 open avenues are genuine research directions:
- Curved-space half-density corrections to contact operators in d=4
  could differ from standard minimal coupling.
- Composition-derived positivity bounds might give a different
  (simpler?) derivation of EFT positivity than the standard
  analyticity + crossing route.

Neither has been worked out, so the question remains open — but the
framework for answering it is now clearer.
