# S226 — Plan: Relativistic ISCO binding energy

Study the ISCO binding energy efficiency for Schwarzschild. The paper already
has E²(6M) = 8/9 at line 175. The remark would state the binding energy
fraction η = 1 - E_ISCO ≈ 5.72%, the standard Schwarzschild accretion
efficiency, and contrast with the SR model (no ISCO, no maximum efficiency).
