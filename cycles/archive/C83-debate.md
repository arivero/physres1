# C83 Debate: Does "Compare-at-Fixed-Ruler" Hide the Regulator?

## Question
If \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\) encodes "how we compare," is this just regulator language in disguise?

## Current Resolution
\(\mathcal C_{b,h}\) is the comparison rule (a scheme choice), but the closure failure/success question is structural:
either the chosen family closes under refinement-comparison (some \(\tau_b\) exists), or it does not (forcing enlargement/counterterms).
We should emphasize invariants (fixed points/exponents) rather than uniqueness of \(\tau_b\).
