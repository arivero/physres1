## Hard question
The paper is deliberately minimal and "referee-safe." Does adding a harmonic oscillator example risk overreach?
## Resolution
No. The harmonic oscillator is *more* elementary than the circle example, not less. It reinforces the thesis in an independent setting using standard coherent-state results. The "referee-safe" standard is preserved because everything is textbook material (Sakurai Ch. 2, or any QM course).
