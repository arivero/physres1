# C243 — Execution

## What changed
Inserted Remark 4.2 (self-adjoint extensions classification) after
Example 4.1 in delta-objects paper. Added reference [Derezinski2024].

Key corrections from BB1 reviewer incorporated:
1. H^1 → H^2 for Sobolev embedding (operator domain of -Δ is H^2).
2. Replaced "ε^{-d/2} scaling" with correct resolvent exponent (Λ^{d-2}).
3. Added sentence: "The resolvent exponent d−2 arises from the heat kernel
   exponent d/2 of Section 2 via a Laplace transform."
