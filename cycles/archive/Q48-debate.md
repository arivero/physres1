# Q48 Debate: Is the new RCP block too notation-heavy for its payoff?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Does introducing \((h,\theta)\), \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\), \(\mathcal Q_\alpha\), and \(\mathcal R_b\) in Appendix 10.3 improve operational clarity, or does it risk confusing readers by drifting from the earlier \(\mathcal C_t,\mathcal Q_\hbar,\mathcal R_\Lambda\) shorthand?

## Recommendation
Keep the operational block, but add a one-sentence mapping between the schematic symbols in P10.1 and the indexed operations in D10.1a (if needed via a follow-up `C` cycle). The payoff (making “compatibility” falsifiable) is worth a small notation bridge.
