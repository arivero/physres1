# S257 — Debate
Individual limits are already stated; the remark's value is collecting
them into a coherent classification. The three-class partition
(vanish/relax/preserve) is implicit but never made explicit. It directly
supports the paper's title concept ("refinement-witnesses") by showing
concretely what "refinement" means: new constraints + preserved geometry.
