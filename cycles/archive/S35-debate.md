# S35 Debate: Is Range Data Mandatory?

## Question
Can the pipeline work without direct range \(\rho(t)\) data?

## Current Resolution
Not robustly for vector-level tests:
- without \(\rho(t)\), only angular-direction kinematics are observed;
- projected areal-rate magnitude then relies on model-dependent orbit fitting;
- for falsifiability-grade tests, explicit range channel (direct or tightly constrained fit) is required.
