# Q142 — Red Team

## Van Vleck transport equation — is it really standard?
Yes. The equation appears in:
- DeWitt 1965 (Dynamical Theory of Groups and Fields)
- Poisson's "Relativist's Toolkit" (2004)
- Visser's "Van Vleck determinants: Geodesic focusing" (1993, hep-th/9303020)
- Vassilevich 2003 (heat kernel user's manual, already cited)

The specific form ∇_μ(Δ^{1/2} ∇^μ s) = D Δ^{1/2} is the divergence form
of the standard Van Vleck transport equation. Dimensional analysis confirms
both sides have consistent dimensions. The referee's CONDITIONAL was about
accessibility, not correctness.
