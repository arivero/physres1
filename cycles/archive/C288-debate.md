# C288 Debate: Should Section 9 stay high-level or become task-executable?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
For a mature review manuscript, is a generic "future work" section preferable to a concrete execution queue with explicit closure criteria?

## Options
1. Keep generic bullets to preserve broad scope.
2. Convert to concrete work packages linked to explicit vulnerabilities.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
The manuscript is currently stable partly because Section 9 does not force concrete next derivations. Converting vulnerabilities into closure targets and work packages raises the activation energy for shallow edits and lowers the friction for substantive ones.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Next main-paper cycle can pick one package directly without re-scoping work.
- Q pass should verify that the added roadmap remains scientifically scoped and not project-management prose.
