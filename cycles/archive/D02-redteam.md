# D02 Red Team: Risks (Theme K)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Failure modes
- The note is “too obvious”:
  - Mitigation: keep it very short but explicitly tie it to the manuscript’s stationary-phase interpretation and to “orbit picture = wavepacket.”
- Angle-operator rabbit hole:
  - Mitigation: no operator claims; only Fourier/separation.
- Missing anchor:
  - Mitigation: run `B10` to ingest one OA lecture-note anchor for spherical harmonics / angular momentum.
