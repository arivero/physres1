# S188 Execution: Crossing Symmetry & Grassmann Obstruction

## Work Done
1. Wrote blackboard 0 on crossing symmetry, Mandelstam channels, Grassmann obstruction
2. Launched S-matrix theorist persona reviewer (SubAgent)
3. Applied all corrections from reviewer feedback

## Reviewer Findings
- **HIGH (1)**: Mandelstam analyticity assumptions not stated explicitly
- **MEDIUM (4)**: crossing for fermions, t-channel conflation, Froissart bound relevance, physical regions
- **LOW (2)**: notation clarity, example choices
- **CORRECT (2)**: Grassmann vs channel orthogonality, spinor sign inclusion

## Changes Applied
- Explicit Mandelstam assumptions section
- Separated Grassmann obstruction from channel kinematics
- Clarified fermion crossing spinor signs
- Dropped Froissart-Martin bound (not essential for remark scope)
- Tightened physical regions discussion

## Status
Ready for C229 promotion.
