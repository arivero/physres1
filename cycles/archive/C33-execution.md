# C33 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Changes
1. `papers/delta-objects/main.md`
   - Started a new dependent draft unifying three “delta objects” (identity kernel, stationary-set delta, point interaction) in the half-density-first language.
   - Included an explicit worked near-diagonal scaling computation showing the intrinsic \(\varepsilon^{-d/2}\) exponent in the identity delta kernel.
