# C107 Debate: Placement and scope of H4.0c

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Should H4.0c be in Section 6 (kernel composition) or Section 8 (renormalization)?

## Working answer
Section 6 is correct: H4.0c is a companion to H4.0b (which is also in Section 6) and discusses the half-density conformal structure. Although H4.0c mentions RG/gauge couplings, its main point is comparing the half-density D=4 filter with the RG D=4 filter — so it belongs alongside the other D=4 filter remarks (H4.0a, H4.0b) rather than in the renormalization section proper.

## Next check
Q62 referee pass should verify the placement is natural for a reader.
