# S149 Execution: Bargmann representation and action-angle duality

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 0 on Bargmann-Segal representation.
2. Reviewer (mathematical physicist / geometric quantization) found:
   - Transform formula, inner product, creation/annihilation correspondence: all CORRECT.
   - α vs ᾱ inconsistency in coherent state kernel: text said |α⟩ ↦ e^{αz} but reproducing kernel is K_α(z) = e^{ᾱz}. Fixed in promoted remark by using K_α(z) = e^{ᾱz} consistently.
   - Husimi function formula needs convention clarification. Stated descriptively in promoted remark.
   - Spin-j space as polynomials of degree ≤ 2j: CORRECT.
3. Promoted as Remark 6.8 in action-angle Section 6 (after Remark 6.7 on spin coherent states).
