# C70 Execution: Promote Obstruction-Candidate List in main.md

## Work Completed
- Added `Heuristic H0.2` in `paper/main.md` Introduction.
- Promoted a compact list of concrete "refinement-to-zero" failure modes:
  - singular probes (distributional weak forms),
  - non-uniqueness (ordering/discretization schemes),
  - divergence (renormalization).
