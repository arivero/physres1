# Q53 Plan: Referee pass on C96 half-density QFT hygiene

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C96`: remove internal path refs in half-density QFT note

## Goal
Referee-pass the C96 edits for reader experience and publication safety: ensure removing internal pointers did not remove necessary context or introduce ambiguity.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q53-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- No repo-internal file paths remain in rendered prose.
- Technical statements remain self-contained (or clearly scoped as remarks).
- No new claims/citations were introduced.

## Acceptance criteria
- Concrete follow-ups expressed as spawned cycles (if any).
