## Content
Worked verification of Proposition 4.2 (circular uncertainty relation) for the Dirichlet kernel state ψ_M:
- R = 2M/(2M+1) by orthogonality
- Var(L_z) = ℏ²M(M+1)/3
- LHS/RHS = (M+1)(4M+1)/(3M) — grows as 4M/3
- Far from tight: Dirichlet kernel is not a minimum-uncertainty state

## Subagent Review (rigorous mathematician)
All 6 computations verified CORRECT. Pedagogical assessment: USEFUL.
Minor notation issue on intermediate step (cosmetic 4/4 cancellation) — cleaned up in promotion.
