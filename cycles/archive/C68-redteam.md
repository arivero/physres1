# C68 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim:** "forces quantum mechanics" reads as theorem rather than motivation.
2. **Vagueness:** "paradox" statement lacks concrete referents.
3. **Tone drift:** introduction becomes philosophical and loses derivation-first posture.

## Mitigations
1. Keep phrasing as "motivation" and "program", not proof.
2. Mention explicit concrete loci: Dirac-supported probes, distributional derivatives, divergent refinement.
3. Limit insertion to one paragraph; keep the rest of the paper technical.
