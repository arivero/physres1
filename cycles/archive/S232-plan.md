# S232 — Plan: Multi-dimensional free-particle propagator

In d dimensions, K = (m/(2πiℏT))^{d/2} exp(iS₀/ℏ). The Van Vleck
determinant is (m/T)^d, so prefactor is (m/T)^{d/2}. The d/2 exponent
is the same one controlling the Green function diagonal divergence
G₀(0,0;E) ~ ∫ t^{-d/2} dt (Remark 5.2b). Connects path integral
normalization to renormalization threshold.
