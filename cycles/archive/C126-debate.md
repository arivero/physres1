# C126 Debate

## Hard question
Should the 1D loop integral be added to Section 5.9 for completeness?

## Resolution
No. The 1D delta on the full line is finite and doesn't need a cutoff loop integral (it's a well-defined self-adjoint Hamiltonian, as stated in Section 5.8.2). The convention map collects integrals relevant to renormalization; the 1D case is not among them.
