# S39 Debate: Is This Really RG-Relevant or Just Distribution Theory?

## Question
Does the weak-derivative identity add to the RG argument, or is it a disconnected mathematical aside?

## Current Resolution
It is relevant because it strengthens the core narrative:
- "regulate -> subtract local piece -> take limit" already appears in classical variational calculus,
- RG then appears as the scale-composition version of the same compatibility grammar.
