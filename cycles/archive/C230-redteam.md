# C230 Redteam: Hubbard-Stratonovich Promotion

## Promotion Checklist
- [x] Blackboard (S189) fully reviewed and approved
- [x] Content drafted and verified for physics
- [x] Cycle-tag leak check: PASS
- [x] Transcript mention check: PASS
- [x] Diffstat recorded: +8 -0
- [x] No empty diffs (content genuinely added)
- [x] Bibliography entries (Hubbard1959, NambuJonaLasinio1961) added

## Blocking Issues
None. All S189 redteam items resolved. Ready for commit.

## Final Physics Check
Remark 6.5 correctly states:
1. Trace-log effective action: det[...] = exp[Tr log(...)]
2. BCS and NJL examples of HS application
3. Fierz rearrangement basis dependence caveat
4. RG matching (not naive inheritance) requirement

All approved by many-body theorist reviewer.
