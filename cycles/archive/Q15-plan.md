# Q15 Plan: Quality Pass on SR Stability Section

## Goal
Referee-style pass on the newly promoted SR stability section in `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`:
- scope discipline (“SR + external scalar potential”),
- notation consistency (\(L\), \(\gamma\), \(q\), units with \(c\)),
- claim hygiene (witness/constraint language; no overclaim).

## Checks
1. Read-through of Sections 2–6 for flow and internal consistency.
2. Verify the stability inequality reduces to Newtonian \(q<3\) as \(\gamma\to1\).
3. Scan for cycle-label leakage in manuscript prose.

## Acceptance Tests
- No notation collisions or hidden assumptions.
- Stability result is stated as a bounded claim with explicit model scope.
