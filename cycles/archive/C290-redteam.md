## Failure modes
1. Domain witness may be mathematically correct but too terse for readers.
2. Claims could accidentally imply essential self-adjointness when only symmetry is shown.
3. Added notation may conflict with existing symbols.

## Mitigations
1. Show the integration-by-parts identity explicitly.
2. State clearly: symmetry on chosen domain, full extension analysis deferred.
3. Reuse existing `Q_L`, `Q_W`, and `\hbar` notation and local assumptions.
