# S07 Debate

## Question
Is it legitimate to talk about a “square root of \(\delta(f')\)”?

## Working Resolution
Only in the operator/kernel sense: a distributional **half-density** supported at critical points whose product with its conjugate produces the density weights \(1/|f''|\) (the same weights that appear in stationary phase). Avoid claiming an intrinsic object \(\sqrt{\delta}\) as a scalar distribution.
