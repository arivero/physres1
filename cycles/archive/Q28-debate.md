# Q28 Debate: Keep H1.1c in Section 3 or Move to Section 5?

## Question
Should H1.1c stay in the calculus micro-model section, or be moved near contact-interaction sections?

## Current Resolution
Keep it in Section 3 because it functions as a conceptual bridge from the toy derivative model to distributional contact terms before entering explicit singular-QM models.
