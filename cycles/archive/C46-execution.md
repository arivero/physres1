# C46 Execution: Add Conformal Scalarization-Gauge D=4 Filter to Planck-Area Draft

## Work Completed
- Added a short heuristic subsection to `papers/planck-area/main.md` recording the conformal half-density Laplacian identity and the \(D=4\) cancellation of the \((\partial\sigma)^2\) term, clearly separated from the H2.5 coupling sieve.
- Linked to the detailed derivation/check notes:
  - `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` (Derivation D1.3),
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-conformal-rescaling-and-half-density-laplacian-family.md`.

## Result
The Planck-area draft now tracks two distinct routes by which \(D=4\) can appear once extra selection criteria are added:
1) the coupling-dimension sieve (H2.5), and
2) an operator-simplicity criterion in a conformal scalarization gauge.
