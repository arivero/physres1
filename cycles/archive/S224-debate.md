# S224 — Debate

## Why d=2 specifically?
The d=1 case is worked in Example 4.1. The d=2 case is the most interesting
because it exhibits dimensional transmutation — a bare coupling that doesn't
survive the continuum limit, replaced by a new scale α. The d=3 case (scattering
length) would also be interesting but is more complex (power-law divergence)
and less directly connected to the paper's scalarization theme.

## Does this duplicate Example 5.1a?
No. Example 5.1a treats the same physics from the scalarization perspective
(κ/α=1 as dimensionless). Example 4.1b works through the resolvent computation
showing the Λ-cancellation mechanism. The forward reference makes the connection
explicit.
