# S85 Debate

## Hard question
Is the Wilsonian derivation genuinely new content for the rg-fundamental paper, or is it a repackaging of Section 5.2?

## Resolution
It is genuinely complementary. Section 5.2 derives the beta function by imposing μ-independence of T(E) — the coupling runs because the subtraction point shifts. The Wilsonian derivation physically integrates out degrees of freedom in a momentum shell, making three things visible that Section 5.2 does not:

1. **Semigroup composition** (RG-P1.1): two shell integrations compose via additivity of logarithms. This is the concrete realization of the abstract composition law from Section 2.
2. **Information loss** (RG-H1.4, RG-H1.7): many (g_B, Λ) pairs produce the same (g_eff, Λ'). This concretely shows why coarse-graining is a semigroup, not a group.
3. **Section 6 bridge**: the shell integral is literally a Schur-complement-style integration of UV variables, connecting the abstract Gaussian model of Section 6 to the physical delta-interaction model of Section 5.

These three bridges justify a dedicated subsection (e.g., 5.2a or 5.2b) rather than a footnote.
