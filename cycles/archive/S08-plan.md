# S08 Plan

## Goal
Extend the S07 “delta on critical set” story to the clean multi-dimensional setting and connect it to the Van Vleck determinant appearing in semiclassical kernels:
1. the vector identity \(\delta(F(x))=\sum \delta(x-x_i)/|\det DF(x_i)|\),
2. the specialization \(F=\nabla f\Rightarrow \det DF=\det(\mathrm{Hess}\,f)\),
3. the match to stationary-phase weights and the Van Vleck determinant structure.

## Scope
1. Write a dated blackboard note with:
   - the \(\delta(F)\) Jacobian-determinant identity (nondegenerate zeros),
   - the \(\delta(\nabla f)\) specialization,
   - a short stationary-phase comparison in \(n\) dimensions,
   - a “how this relates to Van Vleck” paragraph (mixed Hessian vs Hessian).

## Non-Goals
- No manuscript edits in this cycle.
- No bibliography work (`B02` still blocked by DNS).

## Acceptance Tests
1. New blackboard note exists in `blackboards/` with explicit determinant formulas.
2. The note lists ≥2 promotion candidates (e.g. a short optional appendix note for `paper/main.md` or `paper/notes/`).
