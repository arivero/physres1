# C118 Debate: rg-fundamental standalone cleanup

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Does removing "main manuscript" references weaken the paper's scholarly attribution?

## Resolution
No. The paper cites Brouder (1999), Connes-Kreimer (2000), McLachlan (2017), Jackiw (1991), Manuel-Tarrach (1994), and Boya-Rivero (1994) — proper external references. The "main manuscript" references were to an unpublished internal document, not a citable source. Removing them improves the paper.
