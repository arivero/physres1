# Q90 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Hard question
Is the LaTeX Greek (\acute\alpha\tau o\mu o\varsigma) acceptable?
## Resolution
For a working draft, yes. The LaTeX approximation renders adequately in PDF. For final submission, consider using the Unicode character ἄτομος directly (requires checking that the build chain supports Greek Unicode in text mode).
