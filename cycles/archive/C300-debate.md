# C300 Debate: Keep detailed threshold prose or compress now?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Should `Remark P1.1a` keep the longer explanatory block, or adopt the compact two-sentence form now?

## Options
1. Keep long form for maximal local context.
2. Compress to two sentences and keep companion diagnostics in cycle/notebook layers.

## Decision
2. Compress now.

## Rationale
The compressed form preserves the technical caveats while improving section readability and avoiding new claims.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- If additional detail is needed later, reopen via a future `C` cycle with targeted scope.

## Closure addendum
User preference settled the debate: keep the long explanatory paragraph in the manuscript.
