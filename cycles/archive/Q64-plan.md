# Q64 Plan: Referee pass on C109 (Remark HD-D1.3a)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C109`: promote Remark HD-D1.3a into `papers/half-density-qft/main.md`

## Goal
Referee-pass the promoted remark for correctness, claim hygiene, notation, and placement.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q64-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: remark label matches content (not a derivation or proposition).
- Notation: consistent D (not d), consistent tilde-Delta, standard xi_conf.
- Mathematics: verify xi = D/(4(D-1)) from laplacian(sigma) matching; verify D/2 residual.
- Placement: remark follows HD-D1.3 naturally, precedes Section 4.
- Cross-reference: PA-H2.6a in planck-area is consistent with HD-D1.3a.

## Acceptance criteria
- Concrete list of edits (if any) or "clean — no follow-ups."
