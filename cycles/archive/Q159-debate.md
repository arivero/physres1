# Q159 Debate

The remark correctly identifies that a_{D/2} is the key coefficient for both trace anomaly and index theorem in even D. The McKean-Singer supertrace connection could be expanded (it requires a Dirac-type operator with grading), but the remark's scope is appropriate: it flags the connection without claiming to derive the index theorem in detail. The half-density framework claim is the novel contribution here — standard treatments use sqrt{|g|} d^D x explicitly; absorbing it into K̃ makes the topological independence more manifest.
