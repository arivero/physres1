# Q42 Execution: Referee Pass on Section 8 (After \(\tau\) Rewrite)

## Checks Run
- Read `paper/main.md` Section 8.1--8.6 for:
  - internal consistency of notation (\(\Lambda\), \(h\), \(b\)),
  - claim hygiene around scheme dependence,
  - correct linkage between `Derivation D6.0` and the explicit witness `Derivation D6.2a`.

## Findings
- \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\) should be presented as a *chosen comparison rule* (scheme choice), not as canonical/unique.

## Edits Made
- Adjusted wording in `paper/main.md` `Derivation D6.0` to remove an unnecessary "canonical" phrasing for \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\).

## Next Spawn
- `C84`: add one additional Newton-limit paradox witness that forces a deformation/control parameter (tie explicitly to \(\hbar\)) without drifting into standard narratives.
