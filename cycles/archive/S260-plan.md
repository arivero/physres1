# S260 — Plan
Study the total energy of SR circular orbits for the inverse-square force.
Derive E_circ explicitly, show it equals mc^2 * omega (the precession
parameter from Remark 3.2), and compare this functional form with
E^2(r) for Schwarzschild circular orbits (Section 4.3). Assess whether
the energy-precession link is worth a remark in the paper.
