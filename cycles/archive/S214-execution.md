# S214 Execution: Why D=10,11,26 Are Absent

## Findings

The half-density framework operates at **Layer 1** (target-space measure theory
and functional analysis), producing thresholds at d=2,3,4 via the d/2 exponent.
String-theory dimensions (6,10,11,26) come from **Layer 2** (field content, anomaly
cancellation, SUSY representation theory) — a genuinely different layer of physics.

### Specific results:
1. All string dimensions have **parity-like obstructions** in the monomial integrality
   sieve (PA-H2.5): d/2 for d=10,11,26 is either half-integer or odd, making it
   unreachable by integer powers of dimensionful couplings.
2. The framework correctly identifies d=4 via a mechanism **structurally independent**
   of string theory — this is a feature, not a bug.
3. A potential bridge exists via the worldsheet (d=2 manifold with D scalar fields
   → central charge = D-26 = 0), but this requires field-content counting, which
   is outside the current framework's scope.
4. The absence is **already noted** in the Planck-area paper (PA-H2.6) and the
   research-state guardrail #3.

## Output
Blackboard slot 3 overwritten (previously: mollifier-polygon parallel, promoted via C246).

## SERENDIPITY: Parity obstruction as a structural explanation
The observation that d/2 values for string dimensions have parity obstructions
(even LHS = odd d/2) is a clean structural explanation for why the two layers
decouple. Could be worth a remark in the Planck-area paper if expanded.
