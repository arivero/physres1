# S265 Plan: The inverse-square law as a triple threshold

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Paper:** `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`
**Parents:** Remark 3.1 (dimensional identity), Remark 3.1b (critical exponent),
Remark 5.2a (stability boundary), Remark 3.2b (Sommerfeld)

## Study Question

The paper identifies at least three distinct special roles for q=2 in SR:

1. **Critical exponent** (Remark 3.1b): q_crit = 2 in SR — the centrifugal
   barrier dominates the attraction as r -> 0 iff q < 2.
2. **Stability boundary** (Remark 5.2a): The stability criterion
   1 + (2-q)gamma^2 > 0 is unconditionally satisfied iff q <= 2.
3. **Dimensional identity** (Remark 3.1): v = K/L only for q = 2.
4. **Sommerfeld/fine structure** (Remark 3.2b): The SR orbit equation
   with q = 2 is Sommerfeld's equation.

Is there a unifying structural principle connecting these roles? Specifically:

- Are roles 1 and 2 mathematically related (both involve q = 2 as a boundary,
  but one is about r -> 0 asymptotics and the other about V_eff'' at the
  circular orbit)?
- Is the dimensional fact (role 3) the underlying cause of roles 1 and 2?
- Would a 2-3 sentence consolidation remark add value, or is it redundant
  with the existing remarks?

## Planned Analysis

1. Trace the mathematical chain: where does q = 2 enter in each derivation?
   Look for a common algebraic origin.
2. Check whether roles 1 and 2 are logically independent or whether one
   implies the other.
3. Evaluate the dimensional identity as a potential root cause.
4. Draft a consolidation remark if one is warranted; otherwise explain why not.

## Deliverables

- Execution note with mathematical analysis of the relationships.
- Debate note assessing the consolidation remark.
- Red-team note stress-testing the finding.
- Recommendation: promote or not.
