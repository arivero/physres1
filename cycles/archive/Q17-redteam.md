# Q17 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Reader overload:** too much detail in one block weakens the central message.
2. **False symmetry:** readers infer \(dA/dt\) and \(dA/d\tau\) are equally physical without operational context.
3. **Scope creep:** Planck-area paper drifts into SR clock-convention debates.

## Mitigations
1. Keep D1.5c concise and tied to interpretation control.
2. Add future S-cycle to seek a covariant invariant postulate (already queued).
3. Preserve “model-level” language and avoid claims beyond the draft’s scope.
