# S16 Debate: Is the D=4 Cancellation a Real Structural Signal?

## Hard Question
If the cancellation of the \((\partial\sigma)^2\) term in
\(\widetilde\Delta=|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g|g|^{-1/4}\)
occurs at \(D=4\) for conformal metrics, is that meaningful (dimension-selecting) or just an artifact of a special ansatz?

## Current Resolution
Treat it as a **new heuristic filter candidate**, not as evidence by itself:
- The computation is real and checkable, but it is done in a restricted conformal class.
- The cancellation suggests a potential “simplest dependence on scalarization gauge” criterion: in \(D=4\) the conjugated operator in a conformal background depends on \(\sigma\) without the quadratic gradient term.
- Whether this extends to a coordinate-free statement (or survives beyond the conformal ansatz) needs separate study.

So: record the observation; queue promotion only after we understand its invariant meaning and its relationship (if any) to the Planck-area half-density scale ladder.
