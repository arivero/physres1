# S260 — Debate

## What the study found

The SR circular-orbit energy for q=2 is E = mc^2/gamma = mc^2*omega, where
omega is the precession parameter from Remark 3.2. This links three distinct
physical threads — energy, orbital precession, and stability — through a single
dimensionless parameter. In GR, the analogous formula
E = (1-2M/r)/sqrt(1-3M/r) mixes gravitational redshift with velocity effects
and no single precession parameter captures the energy.

## Is this new content for the paper?

Partially. The quantity W_min = mc^2*sqrt(1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2)) already appears
in Section 3.1 (line 78) as the effective potential minimum. What is NOT
currently stated:
1. The explicit identification W_min = mc^2*omega (connecting to Remark 3.2).
2. The equivalent form E = mc^2/gamma (total energy = rest energy / Lorentz factor).
3. The contrast with GR, where the energy-precession link breaks.

Point (1) is the genuine insight. Points (2)-(3) add context but (2) is somewhat
standard and (3) may be compressible.

## Tension with existing content

Remark 5.2c already states gamma^2 * omega^2 = 1 and calls this a "stability-
precession duality." Multiplying both sides by (mc^2)^2 gives
(gamma mc^2)^2 * omega^2 = (mc^2)^2, i.e., (gamma mc^2 * omega)(gamma mc^2 * omega) = (mc^2)^2.
Since E = gamma mc^2 * omega^2 / omega ... no, more directly: E = mc^2 * omega.
So E = mc^2 * omega is a trivial restatement of gamma * omega = 1 (multiply by mc^2/gamma).
The Remark 5.2c reader who knows E = mc^2/gamma gets E = mc^2*omega immediately.

This means: the remark is NOT deeply independent of 5.2c. Its value lies in making
the energy connection explicit (since Section 3 doesn't reference 5.2c when stating W_min)
and in the GR comparison.

## Recommended scope

A compact remark (3 sentences) placed after Remark 3.2. Should:
- State E = mc^2*omega = mc^2/gamma explicitly.
- Note the one-parameter unification (energy + precession + stability).
- Optionally contrast with GR (one sentence).

Should NOT re-derive the stability-precession link (that's 5.2c's job).
