# C231 Red Team: Remark 1.2 failure modes

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes
- Scope creep (philosophy, not physics): **mitigated** — Remark is clearly framed as a *suggestive parallel*, not a historical thesis. Hedging language ("in modern terms", "anachronistic", "parallels") signals we are *inspired by* Zeno, not *claiming* Zeno.
- Reader dismissal (ancients didn't use calculus): **mitigated** — reviewer approved the framing as a rhetorical frame, not historical scholarship. Placement after etymology but before rigor sets correct reader expectations.
- Missing proper attribution: **mitigated** — historian-of-mathematics persona review caught and fixed Parmenides/Zeno confusion.
