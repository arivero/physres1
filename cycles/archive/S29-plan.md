# S29 Plan: Covariant Areal Invariant Candidate

## Goal
Identify a clock-independent invariant that can replace fixed \(dA/dt\) and fixed \(dA/d\tau\) postulates in the inverse-square SR branch.

## Scope
1. Define a covariant scalar from orbital angular momentum using source-frame projection.
2. Relate it to \(dA/dt\) and \(dA/d\tau\) in the source rest frame.
3. Derive the resulting radius branch and compare with D1.5b/D1.5c.

## Acceptance Tests
- Invariant definition is explicit and frame-covariant (given source 4-velocity).
- Radius formula under fixed invariant is explicit.
- Conclusion states what becomes robust and what remains model-dependent.
