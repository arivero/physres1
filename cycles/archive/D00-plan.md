# D00 Plan: Fermionic Mediators → Contact/Boundary-Condition Limits (Theme L)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Goal
Pick a bounded novelty target for a new dependent note: clarify what it could mean for a **fermionic** field to “generate a potential,” and state the controlled IR alternative (EFT contact terms / boundary-condition data).

This cycle is discovery/triage only: it must not edit manuscripts.

## Novelty candidates (shortlist)
1. Fermionic mediators → contact/boundary-condition limits (Theme L).
2. Action–angle indeterminacy for central potentials (Theme K).
3. Deepen the “compare at fixed ruler” \(\tau\) formalism beyond current witness.

## Decision criteria
- Foundations-journal tone: precise, minimal, referee-safe.
- Bounded: one short worked computation (or matching argument) + clear claim boundaries.
- Anchoring: identify a single OA reference for Grassmann sources, and reuse existing independent point-interaction anchors already in the repo.
- Integration: should connect cleanly to existing point-interaction + RG witnesses (delta/contact terms) without inflating scope into full EFT/QFT.

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/D00-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- `S61`: produce one explicit EFT→QM contact matching witness (copyable promotion block).
- `B09`: add/ingest one OA anchor for Grassmann sources in fermionic generating functionals.
- `C87`: create `papers/fermionic-mediators-contact-limits/main.md` and build its PDF.
- `Q45`: referee-pass `C87` (parent is `C87`).

## Acceptance criteria
- One chosen target, with:
  - a one-sentence novelty claim,
  - an explicit scope disclaimer,
  - a concrete `S` deliverable and a concrete `B` target.
