# S213 Plan: Caustics, Maslov Index, and the Half-Density Resolution

## Goal
Study what happens at caustics (where Van Vleck D → ∞) in the half-density
framework. Example 3.5b already flags the divergence at ωΔt = π. The
half-density formalism provides a natural resolution via the Maslov index
and metaplectic structure. Understand and formulate this for a potential
Remark 3.5c in delta-objects.

## Scope
1. How √D diverges at caustics (coalescence of classical paths)
2. The Maslov index: counts phase jumps of π/2 through caustics
3. Half-density resolution: the metaplectic correction resolves the sign
   ambiguity of √D; the Maslov index is intrinsic to the half-density bundle
4. Connection to Bates-Weinstein (already in bib) and Arnold

## Acceptance Tests
- [ ] Blackboard slot with clean 5-8 line remark draft
- [ ] Cross-reference to uncuttable (refinement at resolution failure)
- [ ] No claims beyond what Bates-Weinstein 1997 supports
