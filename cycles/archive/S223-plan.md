# S223 — Plan: Dirac-probes expansion targets

## Goal
Draft 1–2 additions for dirac-probes-corners-impulses/main.md.

## Candidates
1. **Remark after Theorem 3.1**: Weierstrass–Erdmann second condition
   (Hamiltonian/energy continuity at corners). Currently only the first
   condition (momentum continuity) is stated. The second condition
   [H]_{t₀⁻}^{t₀⁺} = 0 is a natural companion, especially for autonomous systems.
2. **Remark in Section 4.3**: Action excess geometry. The factor
   t₀(T-t₀)/T in S-S₀ is maximized at t₀=T/2 (midpoint kick costs most).

## Method
Draft directly (these are standard results, no deep study needed).
