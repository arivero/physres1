# Q181 Red Team: Referee attacks on C298

Date: 2026-02-14

## Likely referee objections
- "This is editorial, not physics."
  - Mitigation: map is intentionally compact and only for navigation after substantial technical expansion.
- "Could become stale with future edits."
  - Mitigation: keep future numbering updates synchronized in the same C-wave that changes derivation IDs.
