# C83 Execution: Tighten \(\tau\) as a Compare-at-Fixed-Ruler Lemma

## Work
- Updated `paper/main.md` `Derivation D6.0` to make the control-map statement regulator-independent:
  - introduced the compare-at-fixed-ruler operator \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\),
  - stated closure as \(\mathcal C_{b,h}(A_{h/b,\theta})=A_{h,\tau_b(\theta)}\),
  - pointed to the explicit step-halving witness (`Derivation D6.2a`).

## Result
The Section 8 narrative now states the RG/control-map idea as a purely compositional refinement-compatibility condition, with a concrete toy witness attached.
