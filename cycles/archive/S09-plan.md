# S09 Plan

## Goal
Study point/contact interactions in the **half-density-first** language and extract new “foundation-level” themes:
1. the point interaction as a rank-one bi-half-density kernel,
2. scaling of the point-supported half-density delta (\(\sim \varepsilon^{-d/2}\)),
3. how renormalization in marginal dimensions can be reinterpreted as fixing the missing scale needed to scalarize point-supported half-densities.

## Scope
1. Write a dated blackboard note with:
   - kernel form of the point interaction \(V=g|0\rangle\langle0|\),
   - coordinate expression \(\delta(x)\delta(y)|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}\) and scaling,
   - a clean separation between geometric normalization (half-densities) and RG running (compatibility).

## Non-Goals
- No manuscript edits in this cycle.
- No bibliography work.

## Acceptance Tests
1. New blackboard note exists in `blackboards/` with at least one explicit scaling computation.
2. The note lists ≥2 promotion candidates (for RG note / Planck-area draft / main paper).
