# S225 — Debate

## Is r_ISCO/r_ph = 2 noteworthy?
Yes. The exact factor of 2 between the photon sphere and ISCO is a clean
geometric result that emerges from the Schwarzschild metric. It connects
the null (photon) and timelike (massive particle) sectors and highlights
that the unstable band occupies exactly one photon-sphere radius of width.
