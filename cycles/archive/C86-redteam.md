# C86 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaiming**: reader thinks we proved Planck area is required/fundamental.
2. **Branch mixing**: reader conflates "scale supplier" with full quantum gravity.
3. **Dimension confusion**: mixing \(d\) (composition variable) with \(D\) (spacetime).

## Mitigations
1. Use "natural candidate" language and point to `papers/planck-area/main.md` for hypothesis work.
2. Keep the remark local to scalarization scale units.
3. Explicitly state "spacetime \(D=4\)" in the sentence to avoid conflation.
