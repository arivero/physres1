# C246 — Debate

## Hard question
Does Remark 2.3 add value to the dirac-probes paper, or is it
meta-commentary that belongs only in the cornerstone?

## Resolution
The remark adds value because:
1. The dirac-probes paper explicitly says it is "a companion to the
   cornerstone manuscript" (line 9) and Section 4.5 already bridges
   to the cornerstone's §6. The remark makes this bridge explicit.
2. The threefold pattern (mollifier, polygon, time-slicing) is visible
   only when reading both papers — the remark points the reader to it.
3. At 3 lines of rendered text, the overhead is minimal.

The cornerstone already has Remark H1.1a on polygon convergence and
§5.3 on mollifier probing, but it does not state the parallel between
them. The remark could equally live in either paper; placing it in the
companion note after Remark 2.2 is natural since that is where the
mollifier hypothesis (H3) is dissected.
