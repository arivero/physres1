# C249 Plan: Caustics/Maslov Remark + Hamilton Citation in Delta-Objects

## Goal
Promote S213 findings into delta-objects:
1. Remark 3.5c (caustics and the Maslov index) — ~3 lines after Example 3.5b
2. Hamilton1834 citation added to Van Vleck section header and references

## Acceptance Tests
- [ ] Remark 3.5c inserted, resolving the loose end from Example 3.5b
- [ ] Hamilton1834 in references with correct numbering
- [ ] No cycle-tag leaks
- [ ] Diffstat recorded
