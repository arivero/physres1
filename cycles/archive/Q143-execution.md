# Q143 — Execution: Referee review of C258

## Verdict: PASS

### Issues found
- **LOW #1** (optional): Remark 3.1b could cite a variational calculus reference
  for the W-E second condition derivation (e.g., Gelfand & Fomin). Not required
  since the statement is a Remark, not a Theorem, and the proof sketch is implicit.

### Checks passed
- W-E second condition correctly stated: ✓
- Variational origin (shifting corner time) correct: ✓
- Display equation matches standard form: ✓
- Reduction to energy conservation for autonomous L: ✓
- t₀(T-t₀)/T maximum at T/2, value T/4: ✓ (arithmetic verified)
- Physical interpretation sound: ✓
- Notation consistent with paper: ✓
