# C60 Debate: Is D1.5h Too Much for Main Flow?

## Question
Could adding a non-planar vector caveat overload a section centered on scalar areal witnesses?

## Current Resolution
Keep it brief and cautionary:
- it prevents misapplication of scalar formulas to 3D perturbed motion,
- it preserves current branch while avoiding hidden assumptions.
