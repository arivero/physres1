## Hard question
Is the Greek typography (\acute\alpha\tau o\mu o\varsigma) the right way to render ἄτομος?
## Resolution
No, it's a LaTeX approximation. The proper Unicode ἄτομος would be cleaner but requires checking that the PDF build chain handles Greek Unicode. The LaTeX rendering is adequate for a working draft; a final notation pass can clean this up.
