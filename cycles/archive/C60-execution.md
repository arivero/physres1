# C60 Execution: Promote Non-Planar Vector-Area Caution

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5h` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` after D1.5g.
- Promoted the non-planar kinematic vector identities:
  \[
  \boldsymbol\ell=\frac1m(\mathbf r\times\mathbf p),\qquad
  \frac{d\mathbf A}{d\tau}=\frac{\boldsymbol\ell}{2},
  \]
  and the scalar projection relation
  \[
  \frac{dA_{\mathbf n}}{d\tau}=\frac{\boldsymbol\ell\cdot\mathbf n}{2}.
  \]
- Kept statement explicitly cautionary: scalar areal postulates in non-planar motion require projection choice.
