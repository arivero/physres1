## Work Done
- Added Remark 5.3 in Section 5, after Remark 5.2 (decoherence), before Section 6.
- Mandelstam-Tamm derivation: Robertson inequality for (H,A) → ΔE·Δt_A ≥ ℏ/2.
- Energy eigenstates static (d⟨A⟩/dt = 0 for all A) — temporal azimuthal uniformity.
- Coherent states saturate the bound (corrected from blackboard's erroneous intermediate values).
- action-angle: 148 → 151 lines (9 pages).
