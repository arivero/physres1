## Findings
Quantum information theorist (CV specialist) reviewed blackboard 6. All claims CORRECT.
- Squeeze operator and quadrature uncertainties: standard, correct convention (ΔX₁·ΔX₂ = ¼)
- Husimi overlap formula: correct
- Action-angle interpretation (amplitude vs phase squeezing): textbook quantum optics
- Prop 4.2 saturation: plausible but verify (we don't claim precise saturation in the remark)
- LIGO/Virgo: correct (not included in remark, too applied)
No changes needed.
