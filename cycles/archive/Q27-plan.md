# Q27 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5m

## Goal
Check coherence and readability after adding the regime-calibration note D1.5m.

## Checks
1. Read D1.5b-m as one argument chain.
2. Verify D1.5m adds calibration clarity without derailing section flow.
3. Confirm no conflict with D1.5k/l baseline trigger language.
4. Run guardrail scan on `paper/main.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- No internal contradictions.
- No accidental universal-claim wording.
- Guardrail scan remains clean.
