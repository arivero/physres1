# S205 — Debate

## Hard question
Is the 1/6 ratio physically meaningful, or just an artifact of comparing
two different force models (SR + external potential vs. GR geodesics)?

## Resolution
The ratio is physically meaningful in the following sense: for weak-field,
slow-motion orbits, the SR precession captures the kinematic (velocity-
dependent mass) contribution, while the remaining 5/6 comes from the
−2ML²/r³ term in the Schwarzschild effective potential, which has no
SR analog. In the post-Newtonian expansion, the SR contribution is the
"1PN kinematic" term.

The ratio is model-dependent: it assumes an external inverse-square
potential in SR (not a field-mediated interaction). But for the paper's
purposes, this is fine — the point is that SR and GR represent different
levels of kinematic refinement, and the SR level captures a definite
fraction of the full effect.
