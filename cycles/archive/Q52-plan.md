# Q52 Plan: Referee pass on C95 reader-map clarifications

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C95`: clarify reader-map symbols and future work

## Goal
Referee-pass the C95 changes for reader experience and claim hygiene: the reader map should reduce friction (not add it), and Future Work should remain accurate and non-editorial.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q52-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Reader map clearly signals where symbols are defined.
- No new claims/citations were introduced.
- Future Work phrasing matches the current manuscript state.

## Acceptance criteria
- Concrete follow-ups expressed as spawned cycles (if any).
