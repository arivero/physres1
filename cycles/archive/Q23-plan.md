# Q23 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5i

## Goal
Referee-style check after adding D1.5i observability criterion.

## Checks
1. Read D1.5b-i as one structured chain.
2. Verify observability criterion is operational (projection, clock, reconstruction) and not vague.
3. Guardrail scan on `paper/main.md` for cycle-label leakage.

## Acceptance Tests
- No contradiction with prior branch remarks.
- No scope drift beyond branch-level claims.
