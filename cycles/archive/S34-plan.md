# S34 Plan: Observability of Projected Areal-Rate Postulates

## Goal
Determine when a projected areal-rate postulate (from D1.5h) is operationally testable in perturbed-orbit settings.

## Scope
1. Define the projected observable in source frame:
   \[
   \dot A_{\mathbf n}=\frac12\,\mathbf n\cdot(\mathbf r\times\mathbf v).
   \]
2. Derive its evolution law under perturbing forces.
3. Translate into a practical data requirement checklist.

## Acceptance Tests
- One clear criterion stating what must be specified to make the postulate falsifiable.
- Explicit distinction between kinematic identity and dynamical content.
