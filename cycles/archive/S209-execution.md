# S209 — Execution

## What was done
1. Computed the Laplace representation connecting heat kernel exponent
   d/2 to Green function singularity at coincidence.
2. Verified with SymPy: ∫t^{-d/2}e^{-κ²t}dt = Γ(1-d/2)κ^{d-2}.
3. Confirmed: converges iff d<2. At d=2: marginal (log divergence).
4. Drafted Remark 4.3 for delta-objects paper (4 lines).

## No separate blackboard needed
The calculation is short enough to go directly into the remark.
Existing blackboard 1 (self-adjoint extensions) already covers
the broader topic; this is a focused addition.
