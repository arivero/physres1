# S157 Execution: Conformal symmetry at RG fixed points

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 1 on conformal symmetry at RG fixed points: scale invariance, c-theorem, a-theorem, conformal bootstrap.
2. Reviewed by CFT expert: conformal group SO(d,2) WRONG for Euclidean signature (should be SO(d+1,1)); scale→conformal proven only in d=2, perturbative in d=4; Zamolodchikov and Komargodski-Schwimmer attributions correct.
3. Corrections: fixed group to SO(d+1,1), clarified d=2 proof status, stated d=4 a-theorem without claiming scale→conformal is proven there.
