# C49 Plan: Promote S21 Generic-\(q\) Areal-Speed Remark into Planck-Area Draft

## Goal
Turn the S21 blackboard derivation into a compact insertion in `papers/planck-area/main.md`:
- generic \(F=K/r^q\) circular-orbit formula in terms of \(\dot A\),
- statement that the Planck-areal-speed \(\Rightarrow\) reduced-Compton cancellation is special to \(q=2\),
- short dimension link \(q=n-1\) (Newtonian long-range forces), with the \(n=2\) caveat.

## Scope
- Edit `papers/planck-area/main.md` near `Derivation D1.5`.
- Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md` has a short remark right after `Derivation D1.5` stating the generic-\(q\) formula and why \(q=2\) is special.
2. The insertion is clearly marked as a derivation/remark, not a claim that the half-density scale ladder is proved by this witness.
3. Cycle status recorded in `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.
