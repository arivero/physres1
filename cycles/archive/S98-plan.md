# S98 Plan: Expand Dirac Probes satellite — second worked model
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Add a second worked model to the Dirac Probes paper. The current paper has one model (delta-kick free particle). Candidates:
1. Double-well with corner trajectory (Weierstrass-Erdmann application).
2. N-impulse sequence approaching the path integral time-slicing.
3. Harmonic oscillator with impulsive frequency change.

## Assessment
Option 2 (N impulses → path integral) is the most compelling because it connects the impulse formalism back to the cornerstone's composition story (Section 6). It makes the paper serve as a bridge from distributional mechanics to path integrals.

## Approach
Add Section 4.5: "From N impulses to time-sliced path integral." Show that N equally spaced impulses with random J_k recovers the time-slicing prescription in the limit, connecting to the cornerstone's composition postulate.
