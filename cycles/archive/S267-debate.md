# S267 — Debate

## Advocate (for promotion)

1. **The formula is genuinely new.** The paper currently has the stability
   criterion 1 + (2-q)gamma^2 > 0 (Section 5.2) and the precession duality
   gamma^2 omega^2 = 1 at q = 2 (Remark 5.2c), but never interprets these as
   an epicyclic frequency ratio. The formula omega_r^2/omega_phi^2 = 3-q-beta^2
   provides a unifying physical interpretation that subsumes both.

2. **The universal -beta^2 correction is a clean insight.** The SR modification
   to the Newtonian epicyclic frequency is the *same* for all power laws: just
   subtract v^2/c^2 from the Newtonian 3-q. This universality is non-obvious
   and worth stating.

3. **It completes the frequency story.** Remark 4.3e gives the GR epicyclic
   ratio sqrt(r_0/(r_0-6M)). Our SR formula is its flat-spacetime counterpart.
   The paper has the GR version but not the SR version — an asymmetry.

4. **Compact.** At 5 lines, well within the ~29-line budget.

## Skeptic (against promotion)

1. **Partial overlap with Remark 5.2c.** The q = 2 case is already stated (in
   different language) as gamma^2 omega^2 = 1. The new remark's novelty lies
   only in the general-q extension. Is "3 - q - beta^2 for general q" worth
   5 lines, given the paper focuses on q = 2?

2. **Effective mass subtlety.** The derivation requires specifying m_eff = gamma m
   from the Hamiltonian expansion, not gamma^3 m. This is standard but not
   trivial — some readers might expect gamma^3 m. A 5-line remark cannot explain
   this, so it must be stated without derivation. Is that pedagogically sound?

3. **The Newtonian epicyclic ratio 3-q is itself standard.** Stating its SR
   correction is incremental, not structural. A referee might say "this follows
   immediately from Section 5.2 by dividing by omega_phi^2."

## Resolution

The advocate's points (1) and (2) are strongest: the formula is new in the
paper and the universality of the -beta^2 correction is non-trivial. The
skeptic's point (1) is valid but mitigated — the remark explicitly subsumes
5.2c as a special case, adding coherence rather than redundancy. Point (2)
is a minor concern: the remark can cite "the Hamiltonian framework of
Section 5.1" and the reader can verify.

**Verdict: PROMOTE.** The general-q epicyclic ratio formula is compact, correct,
and provides a unifying interpretation of stability and precession. Place as
Remark 5.2d after Remark 5.2c.
