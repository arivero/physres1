# S169 — Execution

Integrable-systems reviewer caught an incorrect Duistermaat reference:
was CMP 77 — **correct** source is Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 33 (1980) 687.
All physics descriptions (monodromy matrix in GL(d,Z), quantum lattice defect
from Bohr-Sommerfeld) confirmed correct. Ready to promote as Remark 6.10.
