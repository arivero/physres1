# C27 Debate

## Question
Should the Planck-area draft introduce “delta kernels” explicitly, or is it enough to use the identity kernel only as a scaling witness for \(\varepsilon^{-d/2}\)?

## Working Resolution
Use only the identity kernel (canonical bi-half-density) as the scaling witness, and keep contact-interaction rank-one kernels in the RG note. This keeps the Planck-area draft focused on normalization/scale rather than renormalization.
