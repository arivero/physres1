# Q18 Debate: Does D1.5d Belong Here or in a Separate Note?

## Question
Should the invariant-candidate content be moved to a dedicated relativistic note to keep the Planck-area draft lighter?

## Current Resolution
Keep D1.5d in-place for now:
- it directly controls interpretation of D1.5b/D1.5c;
- the remark is short and prevents overclaiming;
- if the section grows, split into a dedicated follow-up later.
