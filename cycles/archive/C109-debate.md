# C109 Debate: Should the remark mention the general-metric formula explicitly?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The remark currently mentions the general-metric potential V = |nabla omega|^2 - Delta_g omega with omega = (1/4)ln|g|. Should this formula be expanded into a full derivation?

## Recommendation
No. The blackboard note (S72) has the full derivation. The remark's role in the half-density-qft paper is to record the *structural distinction* (half-density != Yamabe, != xi*R, D=4 is conformal-class-specific), not to duplicate the derivation. A reader wanting the details can follow the pointer to the blackboard. If this paper becomes a submission target, the derivation can be inlined in a later C cycle.
