# C00 Plan

## Goal
Lock thesis, notation, section map, and acceptance criteria for the full paper pipeline.

## Scope
1. Define notation for action, areal velocity, angular momentum, and distribution/test-function objects.
2. Fix section order from Newton to path integral and QFT-level control logic.
3. Establish claim labels: `Proposition`, `Derivation`, `Heuristic`.

## Claims
1. The manuscript can be built as a sequence of controlled refinement arguments.
2. Dirac/point-like probes belong in the variational section as weak-limit tools.
3. Deformation and renormalization sections should be presented as continuity/control mechanisms, not detached appendices.

## Risks
1. Historical and formal layers may be mixed without clear boundaries.
2. Distribution theory may be overstated if regularization assumptions are implicit.
3. Narrative may jump from classical to quantum without explicit composition argument.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `paper/main.md` has abstract, introduction, and notation scaffold.
2. A claim taxonomy is visible in the manuscript.
3. The cycle roadmap in `AGENT.md` remains consistent with manuscript section order.
