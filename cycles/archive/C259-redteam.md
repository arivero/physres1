## Citation check
[Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials] already in bibliography (item 1 in delta-objects
references via companion dirac-probes paper). Wait — let me check: is
Jackiw1991 cited in the delta-objects references?

Actually, checking: the delta-objects bibliography does NOT list Jackiw1991.
It's in the dirac-probes bibliography. The Example 4.1b cites it with
[Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials] but the reference is missing from this paper.

ISSUE: Missing bibliography entry. Needs to be added.
