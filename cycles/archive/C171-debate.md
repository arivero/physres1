# C171 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Arguments for promotion
- Squeezed states are the natural generalization of Example 6.1 (Fock vs coherent)
- Connects to Remark 6.4 (Husimi) by showing that the ring-blob dichotomy is a special case of a continuous ellipse family
- Quantum information theorist subagent reviewed all claims CORRECT
- Keeps the paper's action-angle narrative complete: not just two extremes but a continuum

## Arguments against
- Could be seen as tangential (quantum optics rather than central potentials) — but Examples 6.1 and 6.4 already use HO/coherent states
- No new formula — but the structural point is the novelty

## Decision
Promote. The remark naturally extends the Husimi discussion (6.4) and enriches the action-angle tradeoff narrative.
