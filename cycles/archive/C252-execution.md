# C252 Execution: Relativistic Paper — Remark 4.3a + Remark 5.2a

## Changes Made

### 1. Remark 4.3a (after ISCO, line 176)
"SR vs GR stability": SR has no ISCO for q=2; entire boundary at r=6M is
curvature effect (same 5/6 fraction as precession). +3 lines.

### 2. Remark 5.2a (after stability criterion, line 223)
"Inverse-square law as stability boundary": q=2 is the unique boundary
between unconditional and speed-conditional stability. Partitions power laws
into three regimes. +4 lines.

## Diffstat
papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md: +6 net lines (233 → 239)

## No Q cycle needed
Both remarks are direct consequences of equations already in the paper.
No new physics claims — just structuring existing results as observations.
