# C22 Execution

## Changes
1. `paper/main.md`
   - Added an explicit “Contributions” list to reduce “synthesis but what is new?” referee risk.
   - Added a dimension bookkeeping note distinguishing composition-variable \(d\) from spacetime \(D\), and changed the schematic QFT action integral to \(\int d^D x\).
   - Added a single forward pointer to the dependent Planck-area note from `Heuristic H4.0a`.
   - Clarified the Gaussian-semigroup normalization derivation as Euclidean/analytic-continuation (or \(i0\)) based.
2. `papers/planck-area/main.md`
   - Added an explicit “minimal claim vs conjectural claim” paragraph to the abstract.
   - Added a compact dimension-notation note clarifying spatial vs spacetime readings of \(d\).
3. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`
   - Rephrased the abstract thesis in conditional “compatibility forced by definition via refinement” terms.
   - Added independent point-interaction anchors (self-adjoint extension / connection-condition literature) to the 1D U(2) discussion.
   - Expanded Section 7 into a tagged `C`/`S`/`B` forward checklist.

## Notes
- Kept edits minimal and local: no global symbol renaming, and no additional derivations (those belong in `S01`).
- Manuscript policy guardrail checked: no cycle IDs were introduced into `paper/main.md`.

## Status
Completed.
