# C114 Debate: Where to place the linear/nonlinear beta remark?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Three possible placements:
1. After D6.2a-sg (inside the toy model discussion).
2. After H6.2 / closing paragraph of Section 8.4 (at the summary level, before §8.5).
3. In a new remark between §8.4 and §8.5.

## Decision
Option 2 — the closing paragraph of §8.4.

## Rationale
The closing paragraph already addresses the "toy model vs real RG" boundary (Butcher group vs Wilsonian semigroup). The linear/nonlinear beta point is a sharpening of that same boundary. Placing it there gives the reader the complete picture before moving to §8.5's field-theory formalism. Placing it inside D6.2a-sg would interrupt the semigroup derivation flow; a standalone remark would feel disconnected.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Q69 should verify the cross-references (D6.2a-sg, D6.2, P6.2) and the essential-singularity formula.
