# C55 Execution: Promote Clock-Choice Caveat

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5c` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` immediately after D1.5b.
- Promoted the proper-time areal-speed branch (\(dA/d\tau\) fixed), including:
  - radius formula \(r(M,\dot A_\tau)\),
  - admissibility domain \(GM<2\dot A_\tau c\),
  - \(\dot A_\tau=cL_P\) specialization and endpoint behavior.
- Closed with a two-part takeaway:
  - low-mass Compton-like branch is shared,
  - high-mass asymptotic is clock-convention dependent in this model.
