# Q180 Plan: Referee pass on C297 RCP cross-link hardening

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C297`: D9.1f -> D10.1a cross-link in Section 10.3

## Goal
Referee-pass the new bridge for correctness, scope, and conceptual clarity.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q180-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `notebooks/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- `theta`-bundle interpretation is coherent with D10.1a.
- No false equivalence between ordering and domain mechanisms.
- Cross-link improves rather than clutters flow.

## Acceptance criteria
- PASS/FAIL with one concrete next recommendation.
