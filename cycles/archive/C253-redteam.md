# C253 — Red Team: HD-QFT expansion

## Attack 1: "The propagator formula is textbook"
**Response:** Yes — but the half-density reinterpretation (G̃ = G in flat space,
normalization tied to identity kernel) is what the paper adds.

## Attack 2: "The mass counterterm remark is dimensional analysis"
**Response:** The kernel-level interpretation (δm² · K_Id, with UV scaling governed
by the same D/2 as the identity kernel) makes explicit what is usually implicit.
This is the paper's program.

## Verdict
Safe additions. Q138 caught the (4π) parenthesis error and the UV direction
ambiguity; both fixed.
