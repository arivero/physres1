## Failure Modes
1. Mixing “admissible couplings” conventions (H2.7) with physical claims (which scale is *real*).
2. Quietly allowing inverse or fractional powers (non-analytic at the origin) while claiming to enforce H2.5.
3. Sliding from half-density scalarization (representation choice) into dynamics (string theory) without a clear bridge.

## Mitigations
- Keep the note purely dimensional/analytic: list allowed operations explicitly (integer powers, products; no roots).
- Treat each sieve (gravity-only, \(\alpha'\)-allowed, \(\Lambda\)-allowed) as a separate hypothesis knob.
- Record only what the dimension-matching equations force; any “string” interpretation stays as outlook.
