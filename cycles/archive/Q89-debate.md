# Q89 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Hard question
Is the cornerstone paper ready for external review as-is?
## Resolution
Structurally, yes — all hygiene checks pass, bibliography is complete, no encoding issues, no meta-language leaks. Content-wise, the paper acknowledges its own scope boundaries (Section 9.4 residual vulnerabilities). The main future improvements are: (1) a real loop computation to complement the RG template, (2) a consolidated navigation figure, (3) a venue-specific notation pass. These are enhancements, not blockers.
