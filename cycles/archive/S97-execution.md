# S97 Execution: Dirac Probes satellite paper initial draft
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
1. Created `papers/dirac-probes-corners-impulses/main.md` (172 lines, 5 pages).
2. Paper structure: 6 sections + References (3 refs).
   - Section 2: Mollifier Localization Theorem (Theorem 2.1) with explicit hypotheses (H1–H3) and full proof.
   - Section 3: Corner condition (Theorem 3.1, Weierstrass–Erdmann) and impulse jump (Theorem 3.2).
   - Section 4: Complete worked model — free particle with single delta-kick: trajectory, velocity jump, action evaluation, angular momentum preservation.
   - Section 5: Taxonomy of safe vs unsafe delta uses (mollifier probing vs delta potentials vs undefined products).
3. Key value-add over cornerstone Section 5: explicit functional-analytic hypotheses, complete worked computation, summary table.
4. PDF builds cleanly (5 pages, 332KB).
