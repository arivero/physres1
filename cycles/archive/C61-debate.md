# C61 Debate: Does an Observability Checklist Belong in Main Text?

## Question
Should the three-item observability checklist live in the main derivation flow or in appendix-style notes?

## Current Resolution
Keep it in main flow as a short remark:
- it directly prevents under-specified postulates,
- it is compact and tightly tied to D1.5h.
