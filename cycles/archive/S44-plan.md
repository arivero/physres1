# S44 Plan: Timelike Schwarzschild Circular Orbits and ISCO

## Goal
Derive timelike circular-orbit conditions and the ISCO stability threshold in Schwarzschild in the same effective-potential language used in the existing GR baseline section.

## Scope
1. Solve \(V'_{\rm eff}=0\) for \(L^2(r)\) for \(\epsilon=1\).
2. Compute \(E^2(r)\) on the circular branch.
3. Evaluate \(V''_{\rm eff}\) to obtain the stability condition and ISCO radius.

## Acceptance Tests
- Blackboard derivation is explicit and sign-consistent.
- Clear promotion target for `C71` in `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`.
