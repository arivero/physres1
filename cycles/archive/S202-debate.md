# S202 — Debate

## Key decision
How much of the blackboard material to promote? The blackboard has ~135 lines
including reviewer annotations. The paper is at 4pp (209 lines) with room for
targeted expansion.

## Resolution
Promote a condensed version (~15 lines) focusing on:
1. The expansion formula
2. VVD as parallel transport Jacobian for half-densities
3. The "trace without √|g|" observation (key conceptual point)
4. Forward reference to Section 5's counterterms via a_1, a_2

Omit: functional determinant connection (too heavy for a remark), full
reference list from reviewer (keep only DeWitt and Vassilevich).
