# S17 Execution: Conformal Rescaling and a Weight-Family for the Half-Density Laplacian

## Work Completed
- Added a blackboard note deriving a simple weight-family \(O_a=e^{a\sigma}\Delta_g e^{-a\sigma}\) in the conformal class and explaining why the half-density choice \(a=D/2\) has a special simplification at \(D=4\):
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-conformal-rescaling-and-half-density-laplacian-family.md`
- Recorded a SymPy coefficient check in a reduced \(\sigma=\sigma(x)\) toy model.

## Key Takeaway
Within the conformal ansatz \(g=e^{2\sigma}\delta\), the half-density conjugated operator
\(|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g|g|^{-1/4}\) corresponds to \(a=D/2\) and produces a \((\partial\sigma)^2\) term with coefficient \(D(4-D)/4\), hence a cancellation at \(D=4\).
