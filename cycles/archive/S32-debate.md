# S32 Debate: Does Planarity Restrict Usefulness Too Much?

## Question
Is the extension meaningful if it still assumes planar motion?

## Current Resolution
Yes for this branch:
- central-force bound orbits are naturally planar;
- the result is intended as immediate extension of D1.5-series assumptions;
- non-planar generalization can be a separate wave if needed.
