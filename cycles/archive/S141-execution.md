# S141 Execution: Spin coherent states on S²

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work Done
- Wrote blackboard slot 0: Spin coherent states as angular-momentum analog of harmonic oscillator coherent states. Binomial m-distribution, angular uncertainty ~1/√(2j), SU(2) Robertson bound saturated.
- Mathematical physicist (geometric quantization specialist) reviewed: all 7 claims CORRECT. Definition, variance, angular uncertainty, |⟨J⟩|=jℏ, minimum uncertainty, resolution of identity, and all references verified. Placement as Remark 6.7 in Section 6 recommended over Section 7.
