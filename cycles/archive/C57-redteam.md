# C57 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overstatement:** sounding like no frame-free invariant could ever work.
2. **Unstated assumptions:** circular-planar specialization hidden.
3. **Thread imbalance:** section grows away from main half-density thesis.

## Mitigations
1. Restrict wording to “simple \(I_1,I_2\) invariants are insufficient in this setup”.
2. Keep branch assumptions explicit in the remark.
3. Keep the remark brief and place it as outlook/guardrail only.
