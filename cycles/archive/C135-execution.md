# C135 Execution: Expand uncuttable paper
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
1. **Section 1** (line 18): Added etymology remark — ἄτομος (Leucippus/Democritus), shift from ontological indivisibility to procedural "limit requires refinement rule."
2. **Section 2** (line 32): Added failure example — difference quotient divergence as simplest renormalization model.
3. **Section 3** (lines 51–55): Added path-integral paragraph showing quantum amplitude as doubly "uncuttable" (requires both refinement rule + ordering convention).
