# Q30 Debate: "Paradox" vs "Obstruction"

## Question
Should the introduction call the refinement issue a "paradox" (Zeno-style) or an "obstruction/ambiguity"?

## Current Resolution
Keep "Zeno-style refinement paradox" as a short motivational hook, but keep the content technical:
- the actual point is limit control and non-uniqueness in singular/divergent refinement,
- later sections provide concrete loci where extra control is required.
