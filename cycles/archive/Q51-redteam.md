# Q51 Red Team: What a referee would attack in the C94 reader map

Date: 2026-02-11

## Likely referee objections
- “New symbols appear before definition; this is jargon up front.”
  - Mitigation: one short parenthetical “(symbols defined in Appendix 10.3)” or drop symbols in the early map and keep them only in Appendix 10.3.
- “Redundant with Appendix 10.3.”
  - Mitigation: emphasize it is navigation (end of Section 2.5) while Appendix 10.3 is the formal summary.
