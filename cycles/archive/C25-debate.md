# C25 Debate

## Question
Is H2.5b better treated as “nonnegative integer exponents” (a purely algebraic restriction), or as a genuinely perturbative statement formulated in terms of dimensionless couplings at scale \(\mu\)?

## Working Resolution
Keep both readings visible: (i) algebraic nonnegative-exponent restriction for monomials, and (ii) the perturbative reading via dimensionless couplings \(\hat g(\mu)\) with the explicit warning about \(\mu\)-dependence.
