Wrote blackboard 1: Quantum state tomography.
Key content: Wigner function reconstructed via Radon transform of rotated quadrature
measurements P_θ(s). Homodyne detection selects quadrature angle. First demonstrated
by Smithey, Beck, Raymer, Faridani (1993) for squeezed vacuum. Quantum optics reviewer
flagged Radon transform sign convention — described conceptually to avoid ambiguity.
