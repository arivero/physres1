# D09 Red Team: Housekeeping-cycle risks

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Housekeeping becomes an excuse to avoid technical work:
  - Mitigation: time-cap planning cycles; always leave a concrete next action.
- Next-action list becomes too long / vague:
  - Mitigation: keep ≤3 items and phrase each as a bounded deliverable.
