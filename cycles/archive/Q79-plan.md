# Q79 Plan: Referee pass on C124 (RG-D1.2a in rg-fundamental)

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C124`: Wilsonian shell-integration derivation RG-D1.2a promoted into rg-fundamental Section 5.2.

## Goal
Referee-pass the C124 manuscript changes and do a broader coherence check of rg-fundamental for P01 readiness.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q79-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: theorem vs heuristic labels match content.
- Notation: consistent, no dimension mixups.
- Citations: load-bearing claims anchored.
- Cross-references: RG-P1.1, RG-H1.4, RG-D1.7 cited correctly from RG-D1.2a.
- Conclusion: does it still accurately reflect the paper's contents after C124?
- Reader flow: does RG-D1.2a interrupt or enhance Section 5.2?

## Acceptance criteria
- Concrete list of follow-up cycles (S/B/C/D) or "clean" if no issues.
