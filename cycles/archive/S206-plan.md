# S206 — Plan

## Goal
Study the structural parallel between mollifier localization (Theorem 2.1
in dirac-probes) and Newton's polygonal refinement (cornerstone Section 5).
Both are "probe-then-refine" arguments with the same logical structure:

1. Start with a global/discrete condition (stationarity / area preservation)
2. Introduce a refinement parameter (mollifier width ε / polygon step N)
3. Show the condition holds at each scale
4. Take the limit (ε → 0 / N → ∞) to extract local/continuous information

Write a blackboard note and propose a remark for promotion.

## Scope
- Articulate the parallel precisely
- Note how the mollifier ε and time-slice Δt play analogous roles
- Connect to the paper's Section 4.5 (N impulses → path integral)
- Keep the remark compact (~5-8 lines)

## Acceptance tests
1. The parallel is genuine (not a forced analogy)
2. The remark adds insight about the refinement story
3. Fits naturally in Section 2 (after Remark 2.2 or in the Outlook)
