# S227 — Plan: Dirac-probes Jacobi sufficiency + second variation

Study the Jacobi sufficiency condition for the free-particle model. The action
excess S-S₀ = (m/2)(t₀(T-t₀)/T)(Δv)² > 0 (Section 4.3) implies the straight
line is a strict local minimum, not merely stationary. This follows from the
strong Legendre condition (∂²L/∂ẋ² = m > 0) and absence of conjugate points.

Target: Remark 4.3b connecting action excess to classical sufficiency theory.
