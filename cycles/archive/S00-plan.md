# S00 Plan

## Goal
Create a blackboard note tightening the bridge:
\[
\text{half-density scalarization needs } \text{length}^{d/2}
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\text{RG can generate a length scale}
\]
and record how this yields an *area* scale when \(d=4\).

## Scope
1. Write one dated blackboard note in `blackboards/` exploring:
   - what “\(d\)” refers to (configuration vs spacetime dimension) in the half-density weight,
   - how an RG-invariant scale \(\kappa_\ast\) (from 2D delta or other toy models) can supply the \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) constant when H2.4 holds and H2.5 is relaxed,
   - what is genuinely derived vs merely a selection hypothesis.
2. Extract 2–3 bullet “promotion candidates” for `papers/planck-area/main.md` (but do not promote yet unless it becomes clean).

## Acceptance Tests
1. New file exists: `blackboards/2026-02-09-half-density-scale-from-RG.md`.
2. The note ends with an explicit short list of open questions + promotion candidates.
