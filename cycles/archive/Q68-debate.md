# Q68 Debate: Should Section 9.3 item 5 be split for readability?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Line 1100 is now long: it contains the main claim (deformation equivalence), the new half-density sentence, the block-type classification, and the boundary statement — all in one item. Should it be split?

## Recommendation
No immediate action. The content is correct and the paragraph, while long, is a single logical unit (summary of Section 7). Splitting would break the parallel structure with items 1–4 and 6, which are all single paragraphs. A future formatting pass (e.g., pre-submission) could address line length globally.
