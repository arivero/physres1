# S65 Debate: What, if anything, should be inferred from the \(D=4\) cancellation?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Does the disappearance of the \((\partial\sigma)^2\) term at \(D=4\) indicate a deeper invariance, or is it just a simplification specific to the half-density conjugation and conformal ansatz?

## Working answer
Treat it strictly as a checked simplification for this operator in this metric class. Any stronger claim (conformal covariance, anomaly statement, or “dimension selection”) needs separate evidence and likely a dedicated `B` anchor.

## Next check
Compare \(\widetilde\Delta\) to the standard conformal/Yamabe Laplacian and verify which object (if any) is conformally covariant under \(g\mapsto e^{2\omega}g\) with an appropriate weight on \(\psi\) (would require a separate bounded study and probably a `B` cycle).
