## Failure Modes
1. Getting lost in normalization conventions and losing the structural point.
2. Introducing a “fix” that silently changes conventions in one file but not others.
3. Treating scheme-dependent constants as physical.

## Mitigations
- Keep this as a blackboard note; promote only stable convention-robust statements.
- Record conventions explicitly rather than rewriting existing derivations.
- Emphasize: scheme dependence rescales the transmutation scale; the beta function is invariant.
