# B06 Debate: OA Expository vs Standard Textbook Reference

## Question
Is it better to cite an OA expository paper/notes, or a standard (often paywalled) textbook, for the measure-theory lemma?

## Current Resolution
Use an OA reference as the immediate anchor (meets policy and is checkable in this environment), and optionally add a standard textbook as `PENDING` later if a more canonical citation is desired.
