# C04 Red Team

## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. The path-integral expression is formal; no constructive measure on generic infinite-dimensional path space is provided.
2. Discretization/ordering effects are acknowledged but not quantified in a worked model.
3. Stationary-phase control is local; global issues (caustics, zero modes, boundary terms) are deferred.

## Evidence Needed
1. `C05` should map one concrete ordering choice to one star-product choice with matching classical limit.
2. A short worked toy system should show how subleading \(O(\hbar)\) terms change under discretization choice.
3. If used later, add explicit assumptions for nondegenerate Hessian or mention treatment of zero modes.

## Next Cycle Patches
1. In `C05`, define deformation parameter and commutator-to-Poisson limit with explicit algebra objects.
2. Tie `C04` discretization ambiguity to deformation equivalence classes, not ad hoc prescriptions.
3. Keep clear separation between formal manipulations and statements claimed as proved.

## Closed Items
1. Composition law and slicing derivation are now explicit.
2. Exponential weighting assumptions are stated rather than implied.
3. `C03` corner/impulse conditions are integrated into the semiclassical admissibility discussion.
