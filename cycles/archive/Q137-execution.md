# Q137 Execution: Referee Review of C251

## Verdict: MINOR REVISION → fixes applied → PASS

### Issues found:

**HIGH:**
1. Sign error in Example 3.4a: q̈ = -(Δv)δ should be q̈ = +(Δv)δ.
   **FIX APPLIED.** Also rewrote sentence to use forced equation mq̈ = Jδ
   for clearer logic flow.

**MEDIUM:**
2. Remark 2.1: "makes composition well-defined at each resolution" imprecise.
   **FIX APPLIED** → "makes near-diagonal kernel scaling compatible with composition."

**LOW:**
3. Cross-references to companion note could use explicit citation.
   **DEFERRED** — standard for satellite papers in this repo.
4. J not defined in Example 3.4a.
   **ADDRESSED** — rewrote to use forced equation form which is self-explanatory.

### Result after fixes: PASS
