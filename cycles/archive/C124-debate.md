# C124 Debate

## Hard question
Should the Wilsonian derivation be a separate subsection (5.2a) or a labeled block within 5.2?

## Resolution
Labeled block (`Derivation RG-D1.2a`) within Section 5.2. This is consistent with the paper's existing convention of using labeled blocks (Derivation, Proposition, Heuristic, Remark) to structure content within subsections. A separate subsection would inflate the table of contents and suggest the Wilsonian approach is a parallel track rather than a complement to the same material. The labeled block naturally reads as "here is the same result derived another way, making a different structural feature visible."
