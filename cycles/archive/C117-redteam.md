# C117 Red Team: What a referee would attack in PA-D1.3a

Date: 2026-02-12

## Likely referee objections
- **Objection**: "The 'parity obstruction' is trivial — it's just saying a half-integer can't be an integer. This doesn't deserve a named remark."
  - Mitigation: The observation is elementary but its structural consequence is not: it categorically excludes all odd dimensions regardless of which integer-dimensional couplings are admitted, including cosmological constant and gauge couplings. This is stronger than "checking d=3 and finding no solution." The remark's value is in the classification (three *qualitatively distinct* failure modes), not in the difficulty of the individual observations.

- **Objection**: "The magnitude obstruction for even d ≥ 6 can be resolved by adding more couplings (PA-E2 shows gravity + Λ works for d = 8, 12, ...). So calling it an 'obstruction' is misleading."
  - Mitigation: PA-D1.3a explicitly says "gravity-only" and follows PA-D1.3, which assumes only G_d. The obstruction is within this hypothesis. PA-E2 (gravity + Λ) is discussed separately in §3.3. No overclaim.
