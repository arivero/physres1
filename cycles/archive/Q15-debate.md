# Q15 Debate: How Much SR “Mechanics” Belongs in the Note?

## Question
Should the dependent note expand toward a full relativistic two-body/field-mediated treatment, or stay as a minimal SR/GR baseline with explicit modeling assumptions?

## Current Resolution
Stay minimal and derivation-first:
- Keep SR sections as “mechanical SR witnesses” (what breaks/changes already at the kinematic level).
- If we later need field-mediated interactions, add them as a new wave with a separate scope statement and bibliography cycle.
