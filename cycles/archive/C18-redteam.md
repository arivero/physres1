## Failure Modes to Watch
1. Confusing “no log running” (in a scheme) with “no RG structure” (Wilsonian fixed points can still exist).
2. Overstating fixed-point richness in 1D without clearly stating assumptions (full-line vs half-line reduction; which contact family; time-reversal constraints).
3. Letting normalization conventions (T-matrix vs scattering amplitude) obscure the main compatibility point.
