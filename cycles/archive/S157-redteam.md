# S157 Red Team: Conformal symmetry at RG fixed points

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Conformal group SO(d,2) was wrong for Euclidean signature — should be SO(d+1,1). Fixed in promoted remark.
- Scale→conformal implication not proven non-perturbatively in d≥3. Promoted remark states d=2 result precisely, avoids overclaiming for d=4.
- References: Zamolodchikov 1986, Komargodski-Schwimmer 2011 cited by name — need formal entries in B cycle.
