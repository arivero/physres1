The insight is correct but elementary for the paper's target audience (readers
of Hörmander, Albeverio et al.). The paper already implicitly computes the
Green's function in Section 4.2 without naming it. Adding the label adds
modest pedagogical value but no new mathematics. Given the 7pp page count
(over PLB limit), the cost/benefit ratio is unfavorable.
