# C52 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. Inconsistent conventions (units, \(E\) definition) between SR and GR sections.
2. Overclaiming (“photon sphere proves X”) beyond baseline.
3. Turning the draft into a GR tutorial.

## Mitigations
1. State units \(G=c=1\) and restore units in one short subsection.
2. Keep GR baseline as “derivation record”, not a thesis driver.
3. Defer Kerr/lensing/QNMs entirely.
