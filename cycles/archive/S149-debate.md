# S149 Debate: Bargmann representation blackboard

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- All core mathematics verified correct (transform, inner product, operator correspondence).
- The α/ᾱ convention issue was a notational inconsistency, not a physics error. Resolved by using ᾱ consistently.
- Spin-j truncation to polynomials of degree ≤ 2j provides elegant connection to Remark 6.7.
