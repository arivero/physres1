# S166 Debate: Scope of zeta regularization remark

Date: 2026-02-13

## Question
Should the remark mention ζ(0) alongside ζ(−1), or keep it focused on Casimir energy alone?

## Working answer
Mention both briefly: ζ(−1) for Casimir/string zero-point energy, ζ(0) for the conformal anomaly. Two sentences suffice.

## Next check
Verify during C207 promotion that the remark stays concise (≤4 sentences).
