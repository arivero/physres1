# S23 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. Rehashing Section 5.4 without adding any new clarity.
2. Slipping back into the “point potential” topic as the main thread.
3. Writing illegal products of distributions (e.g. \(\delta^2\)) without an explicit regulator.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the deliverable as a “dictionary + one new cautionary example”.
2. Use “point potential” only as contrast.
3. Treat \(\delta'\) only via pairing and/or point-splitting limits.
