# Q11 Redteam: Remaining Risks After Adding H4.0b

## Risks
1. Even with caveats, readers might overinterpret the D=4 remark as a dimension-derivation claim.
2. The term “scalarization” may feel unfamiliar without a quick reminder.

## Mitigations
1. Keep wording “within the conformal class” and “filter candidate” visible (already present).
2. If readers stumble, add a 3–5 word parenthetical (“choice of reference half-density”) next to “scalarization” in H4.0b later.
