# S250 — Execution
Verified: G(t,t') = θ(t-t')/m solves m ∂²G/∂t² = δ(t-t'). Velocity response
Δv = (J/m)θ(t-t₀), position response Δq = (J/m)(t-t₀)θ(t-t₀). Causality
satisfied (retarded condition). Connects to Section 4.5's quantum propagator
K(q_f,q_i;T) — classical G is the ℏ→0 limit modulo half-density.

Proposed Remark 4.2a (retarded Green's function). However, dirac-probes is
already at 7pp (over PLB 6pp limit), so NO PROMOTION warranted.
