# C88 Red Team: Risks for the Action–Angle Remark

Date: 2026-02-10

## Failure modes
- The remark triggers a demand for a full “angle operator” discussion:
  - Mitigation: keep the witness purely at the level of separation of variables and probability uniformity; avoid operator claims.
- The remark reads disconnected from the paper’s narrative:
  - Mitigation: explicitly tie it to stationary-phase classical recovery and wavepacket interpretation.
