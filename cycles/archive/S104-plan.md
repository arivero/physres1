# S104 Plan
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study + promote: extend L > K/c bound from circular to all bound orbits in SR inverse-square force, using effective radial potential. Prompted by user observation and Q99 referee finding.

## Steps
1. Write blackboard with effective potential analysis + small-r asymptotics.
2. Delegate review to subagent with "intuitive physicist" persona.
3. Apply feedback, promote to satellite paper.
