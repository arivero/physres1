# C82 Debate: Cite Only the Review or Also the Original Wilson Paper?

## Question
Should `Remark E4a` cite only `[Greensite2003Confinement]` (OA review), or also `[Wilson1974Confinement]` for attribution?

## Current Resolution
Cite the OA review in the manuscript for now. Add the Wilson 1974 citation later if/when OA status is verified or a local copy is provided.
