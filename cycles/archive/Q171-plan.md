# Q171 Plan: Referee pass for C287

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle
- `C287`: new threshold-unification remark in relativistic satellite.

## Goal
Review C287 for correctness, claim boundaries, notation consistency, and reader-flow impact.

## Checklist
- Correctness of \(q_\mathrm{crit}=\nu+1\) mapping for Newton/SR.
- Explicit separation from dimensional \(q=2\) mechanism.
- No notation drift (`q`, `\nu`, `\gamma`).
- Paragraph integrates with Section 3 flow.
