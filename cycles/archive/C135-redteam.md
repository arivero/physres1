## Failure modes
### 1. Philosophical over-reach
- Risk: claiming to redefine "atom" might irritate philosophers or physicists who use the word differently.
- Mitigation: the note explicitly says "in this note's sense" and frames the definition as structural/mathematical, not as a claim about the history of philosophy.
