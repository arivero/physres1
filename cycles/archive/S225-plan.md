# S225 — Plan: Relativistic paper expansion

## Goal
Add 1 Remark to relativistic-central-orbits that deepens the SR/GR comparison.

## Candidate
Remark 4.3c (Hierarchy of circular-orbit radii): Connect photon sphere r=3M,
unstable region 3M<r<6M, and ISCO r=6M. The ratio r_ISCO/r_ph = 2 is exact.
The entire unstable-orbit band is a pure curvature effect (cf. Remarks 4.3a-b).

## Method
Draft directly (standard Schwarzschild geometry).
