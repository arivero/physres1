## Hard question
Is the paper too close to the cornerstone Section 5 to stand alone?

**Assessment**: No. The cornerstone states P3.1–P3.4 as compressed propositions for the structural chain. This satellite provides: (a) a formal theorem with numbered hypotheses and a remark explaining each, (b) a complete worked computation (trajectory + action + angular momentum), (c) a taxonomy table distinguishing five categories of delta usage. A reader of the cornerstone benefits from the expanded treatment; a reader of this note alone gets a self-contained story.
