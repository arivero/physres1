# S154 Red Team: Anomalies as refinement constraints

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Anomaly cancellation condition originally written as Q_u+Q_d+Q_e+Q_ν=0 — WRONG without color multiplicity and cubic charge conditions. Fixed by describing qualitatively.
- π⁰→γγ rate formula missing N_c (color) factor. Fixed by omitting from promoted remark.
- References: Adler 1969, Bell-Jackiw 1969, 't Hooft 1980, Atiyah-Singer 1968, Nielsen-Ninomiya 1981 cited by name — need formal entries in B cycle.
