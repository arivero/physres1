## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. Continuum-limit statement still assumes differentiable limiting trajectory; weak/rough trajectories are deferred.
2. Historical precision requires explicit Proposition/Lemma citations from specific Principia editions in `C02` or bibliography appendix.
3. The impulse scaffold is mathematically clean but needs explicit statement of admissible force regularity for direct continuous equivalence.

## Evidence Needed
1. `C02` should provide function-space assumptions for Euler-Lagrange and Noether derivations.
2. `C02` should include explicit regularity conditions linking discrete and continuous formulations.
3. Bibliography notes should be augmented with edition-specific Newton references when quoting exact formulations.

## Next Cycle Patches
1. Derive Euler-Lagrange equations with explicit boundary conditions.
2. Derive conserved angular momentum as a Noether charge under rotational symmetry.
3. Add strict separation labels where statements remain heuristic.

## Closed Items
1. `C00` open point on "approximation vs exact finite-step invariant" is closed in section 3.
2. Modern angular momentum bridge for Newtonian area law is now explicit.
