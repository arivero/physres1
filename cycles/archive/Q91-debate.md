## Hard question
Should [Sakurai2020] be cited in the body since it's only in the References section?
## Resolution
For this short note, having it as a supporting reference is acceptable. It anchors the coherent-state material (Example 6.1) and the angular-momentum formalism. Adding an explicit citation in the body would be slightly better but is not a blocking issue.
