# C32 Debate

## Question
Should the half-density kernel remark live in the RG note or in the Planck-area note?

## Working Resolution
Put it in the RG note because the point interaction is the concrete singular-QM witness there. Keep the Planck-area draft focused on scalarization/universal-scale hypotheses; add only a bridge sentence later if needed.
