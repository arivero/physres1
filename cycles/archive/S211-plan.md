# S211 — Plan

## Goal
Analyze open question #2: can RCP be stated as a small set of axioms that
DERIVE quantum mechanics as a consequence?

## Sources
- Cornerstone §10.3 (Foundational Compatibility Principle, P10.1, D10.1a)
- Existing frameworks: Atiyah TQFT axioms, Segal CFT, Costello factorization algebras

## Key question
Is the current P10.1 a classification (organizing existing physics) or a
derivation (proving QM from axioms)? What's missing for the latter?

## Acceptance tests
1. Identify the hierarchy: which axioms → which physics.
2. State what independence proofs look like.
3. Honest verdict: is formalization feasible or a multi-year program?
4. Update motivations.md question #2 status.
