# S212 — Debate

## Hard question
Is calling d/2 the "unifying thread" genuine, or just noting that the
same number appears?

## Resolution
The claim is stronger than coincidence: the three manifestations
(identity kernel, heat kernel, Sobolev embedding) all arise from the
dimensional analysis of the same object (sections of the half-density
bundle). The half-density formalism EXPLAINS the shared exponent —
it's not just that d/2 appears, it's that the half-density structure
is the geometric reason it appears in all three places.
