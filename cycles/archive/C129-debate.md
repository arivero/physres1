# C129 Debate

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Was removing the blackboard references (lines 77, 106) the right call, or should they have been converted to proper citations/appendices?

## Resolution
Removing is correct for now. The blackboard content is working-note material, not a citable reference. If the content is important enough to cite, it should be promoted into either this paper or a separate companion note via a C cycle. For a 131-line note aimed at Tier 1, clean self-containment is more valuable than cross-referencing working notes.
