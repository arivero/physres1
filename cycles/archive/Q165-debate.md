# Q165 — Debate

## Conceptual Strength
The remark unifies two seemingly independent structural features (stability and precession) via a single dimensionless invariant. This is consistent with the "refinement-witness" framing: both orbit shape (precession) and radial response (stability) are governed by γ²ω²=1, a constraint that becomes trivial in the Newtonian limit.

## Potential Alternative Formulations
One could equivalently state: "The stability factor 1+(2-q)γ² at q=2 equals the precession-frequency redshift factor γ²ω²." However, the current phrasing ("unconditional stability ⟺ real precession at all speeds") emphasizes the physical consequence rather than the algebraic identity, which is preferable for a remark.

## Placement Justification
Placing 5.2c after Example 5.2b is natural:
- 5.2a identifies q=2 as a stability boundary
- 5.2b enumerates specific power laws
- 5.2c deepens the q=2 case by connecting stability to precession

An alternative would be to place it immediately after Remark 3.2 (in Section 3), but that would break the logical flow: Remark 3.2 discusses precession before stability is introduced, so the duality couldn't be stated yet.

## No Concerns
The remark does not overreach, does not introduce new notation, and does not require additional bibliography.
