# S258 Plan: Bertrand's Theorem and SR Precession

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Paper:** `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`
**Parent:** Remark 3.2 (SR precession, lines 87-100)

## Study Question

Bertrand's theorem states that in Newtonian mechanics, only two central-force
laws produce closed orbits for all bound initial conditions: the inverse-square
(q=2 in the paper's F = K/r^q convention) and the linear/Hooke (F = kr, which
is q = -1 in the paper's convention). Does SR break the Bertrand closure
property for one or both of these potentials?

## Why This Matters

Remark 3.2 already shows that the SR orbit for q=2 is a *precessing* ellipse
with apsidal advance proportional to K^2/(c^2 L^2). The natural next question
is whether this precession is generically irrational (hence the orbit never
closes), and what happens to the other Bertrand potential (Hooke). This
connects the paper's quantitative precession result to a classical structural
theorem.

## Planned Analysis

1. **q=2 (inverse-square):** Argue from omega = sqrt(1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2)) that
   omega is generically irrational, so the orbit does not close.

2. **q=-1 (Hooke / isotropic oscillator):** Derive or cite the SR modification
   of the apsidal angle for F = kr. Determine whether the apsidal angle
   becomes energy-dependent (hence generically irrational).

3. **Structural point:** Both Bertrand potentials lose the closure property in
   SR. What does this say about the "refinement" theme?

4. **Side finding:** Check whether Example 5.2b's label "q=1 (Hooke / isotropic
   oscillator)" is correct or a mislabeling. In the paper's convention
   F = K/r^q, the Hooke force F = kr corresponds to q = -1, not q = 1.

## Deliverables

- Execution note with mathematical arguments.
- Draft remark (Remark 3.2a) for possible insertion after Remark 3.2.
- Assessment of whether the remark is worth promoting.
