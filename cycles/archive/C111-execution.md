# C111 Execution: Promote S74 quadratic-symbol ordering remark

Date: 2026-02-12

## Change
Inserted Remark D9.1a after D9.1 and before P9.1 in Section 10.2 of paper/main.md.

Content: Q_W(fp²) - Q_L(fp²) = -iℏf'p̂ - ¼ℏ²f'', with note on the richer two-layer correction structure, physical application to position-dependent mass, and half-density conjugation as geometric resolution (cross-ref to HD-D1.3).
