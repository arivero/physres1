## Failure modes

### 1. Author attribution
- Risk: "Alejandro Rivero" might not be the desired author format.
- Mitigation: consistent with other satellite papers. Can be adjusted in a P cycle.

### 2. Date format
- Risk: "2026" is vague (no month).
- Mitigation: standard for working papers. The exact date will be set during the P cycle submission.
