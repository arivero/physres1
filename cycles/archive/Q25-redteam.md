# Q25 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Statistical under-specification:** linear formulas read as complete uncertainty treatment.
2. **Narrative crowding:** too many D1.5 sub-remarks reduce scanability.
3. **Premature maturity signal:** readers infer immediate publishability of implementation branch.

## Mitigations
1. Keep explicit “baseline” wording in D1.5k.
2. Keep future details off main path unless required.
3. Continue staged cycles (S37/C64) before stronger claims.
