## Failure modes
1. **EBK formula**: I_k = (n_k + α_k/4)ℏ is standard (Keller 1958, Berry & Mount 1972). The 1/4 factor for each turning point in the Maslov index is the correct convention.
2. **Arnold-Liouville invocation**: The theorem guarantees the existence of action-angle coordinates for a completely integrable Hamiltonian. No subtlety arises for the examples discussed (all are standard integrable systems).
3. **"Uniformly distributed" angles**: On the invariant torus, the time evolution is quasiperiodic in the angle variables. The semiclassical wavefunction's amplitude is proportional to the square root of the time the classical orbit spends near each angle value — which is uniform for action-angle coordinates. This is correct.
