# S217 Plan: Relativistic Paper — SR/GR Stability Contrast + Crossover Remark

## Target: papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md (233 lines, 4pp)

### Change 1: Remark 4.3a after ISCO (line 176)
Connect SR stability (all q=2 orbits stable) to GR ISCO (r > 6M).
The entire difference is the curvature 5/6 fraction from Remark 3.2.
+3 lines.

### Change 2: Remark 5.2a after stability criterion (line 223)
Note that q=2 is the boundary between "stable for all speeds" and
"speed-bounded stability." For q < 2: always stable. For q = 2: always
stable. For 2 < q < 3: SR speed bound v < c√(3-q). For q ≥ 3: never stable.
+5-7 lines.
