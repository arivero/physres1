# Q131 — Red Team

## Failure mode 1: Over-correction
Risk of adding so many caveats that the 1/6 insight gets buried.

**Mitigation**: Make targeted edits, not wholesale rewriting. One
parenthetical clarification per finding, not a disclaimer paragraph.

## Failure mode 2: Citation gap
Removing BDF citation without replacement leaves the Binet equation
unsourced.

**Mitigation**: Use "standard Binet substitution" phrasing or cite
the relevant section of the cornerstone paper (Section 4.3 already
discusses Schwarzschild orbits).
