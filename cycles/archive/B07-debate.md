# B07 Debate: Cite the Original Wilson Paper in the Core Argument?

## Question
Should the dependent "string tension as area scale" discussion cite the original Wilson 1974 paper, or rely on modern reviews?

## Current Resolution
Use a modern OA review as the primary operational anchor, and keep the Wilson 1974 citation as historical attribution (marked `PENDING` if OA cannot be retrieved).
