# D01 Debate: Where should the action–angle clarification live?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
Should the action–angle/angle-delocalization remark be promoted into the cornerstone manuscript or kept as a dependent note only?

## Decision
Promote a minimal remark into `paper/main.md` (bounded to 1 short derivation block), because it reinforces the manuscript’s “classical = stationary/semi-classical concentration” stance without opening a new domain.
