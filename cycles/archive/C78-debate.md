# C78 Debate: Toy Witness vs Explicit 2D Contact RG in the Intro

## Question
Should the Introduction's divergence witness reference the explicit 2D contact-interaction beta function instead of the calculus toy model?

## Current Resolution
Keep the toy model in the Introduction; it is universal and short. The 2D contact computation stays as the later explicit witness already advertised in the Contributions list.
