# Q61 Red Team: referee pass risks

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes
- **Missing attribution (Nauenberg 1994):**
  - A referee familiar with the history of science literature would notice the missing citation.
  - Mitigation: B16 spawned to add it.

- **H1.2 analogy overreach:**
  - "Constrained corrections ↔ gauge-invariant counterterms" is suggestive but not proven.
  - Status: already labeled as Heuristic. The S69 redteam and C105 redteam both address this. No further action needed.

- **Label collision fatigue:**
  - This is the third Q cycle to note the H1.2/namespace collision without resolving it.
  - Mitigation: it's genuinely non-blocking until cross-references are introduced. But should be resolved in the next dedicated hygiene pass.
