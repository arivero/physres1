# C301 Execution: Newton Polygonal Convergence Theorem + Failure Mode

Date: 2026-02-14

## Work completed
1. Added `Remark H1.2a` to `paper/main.md` Section 3.3, immediately after `Heuristic H1.2`.
2. The remark states the O(h) convergence theorem for Lipschitz forces and identifies the r=0 collision singularity as the failure mode.
3. Connected back to the existing hedge in H1.1a.

## Content promoted
From `blackboards/6.md` Section 6 (promotable paragraph), compressed to fit the remark style of Section 3.

## Discovery flag
No — this is a synthesis/clarification promotion, not a new discovery.
