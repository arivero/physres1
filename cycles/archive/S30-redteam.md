# S30 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overgeneralization:** concluding no covariant construction is possible at all.
2. **Hidden assumptions:** planar circular-motion simplifications not stated.
3. **Conceptual drift:** mixing “observer dependence” with coordinate non-covariance.

## Mitigations
1. Restrict claim to “simple invariants \(I_1,I_2\) are insufficient in this setup”.
2. Keep the circular-orbit assumptions explicit.
3. Distinguish covariant-with-\(U^\mu\) from frame-free scalars.
