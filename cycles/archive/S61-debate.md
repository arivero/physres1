# S61 Debate: How far to take the contact expansion?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
Should the promotion target include only the leading \(\delta\) contact term, or also include the first derivative correction (\(\nabla^2\delta\))?

## Decision
Include both at the statement level, but fully derive only the leading two terms (\(C_0\) and \(C_2 q^2\)) to keep the note bounded.

## Rationale
The first derivative correction is enough to show the pattern “polynomial in momentum \(\leftrightarrow\) derivatives of \(\delta\)” without turning the note into a full EFT treatise.
