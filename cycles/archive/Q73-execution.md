# Q73 Execution: Referee pass on S80 + S81 — D=4 filter independence and p=1 origin

Date: 2026-02-12

## Checks performed
1. **H4.0b** (main paper, line 546): correctly states scalar Laplacian conjugation, D(4-D)/4 coefficient, "operator-simplicity filter (scale-neutral) and is independent of the coupling-dimension sieve." Consistent with S80 (independence confirmed) and S81 (form-degree-independent).

2. **H4.0c** (main paper, line 553): correctly states "the half-density version is universal (independent of matter content), while the RG version is coupling-specific (tied to the form degree of the gauge connection via D=2(p+1))." Consistent with S81 (p=1 not from volume half-density).

3. **HD-D1.3** (half-density-qft, line 101): correctly scoped to scalar Laplacian in conformal class. Scope disclaimer (line 121) explicit. HD-D1.3a correctly distinguishes from conformal coupling. No p-form overclaim.

4. **PA-D1.3 + PA-D1.3a** (planck-area, lines 95–106): gravity-only sieve correctly scoped as coupling-dimension argument (scale leg). Three-obstruction classification (parity, magnitude, degenerate) is consistent with S80's finding that this sieve is independent of the operator filter.

5. **PA-E5a** (planck-area, line 314): three-level hierarchy doesn't mention gauge-field selection — correct, since the hierarchy is about dimension, not form degree.

6. **Wording check**: no manuscript text incorrectly implies half-density selects p=1 or that operator filter implies sieve. H4.0c explicitly disclaims this.

## Verdict
**Clean pass.** No corrections needed. All manuscripts correctly distinguish the three D=4 filters (half-density operator, coupling-dimension sieve, gauge marginality) and correctly characterize their independence.
