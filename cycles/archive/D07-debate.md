# D07 Debate: How standalone should dependent notes be?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
For dependent notes under `papers/`, should we aim for full standalone readability (no companion-note dependence), or is “companion note” cross-referencing acceptable?

## Current position
Remove explicit repo file paths and keep only light, conceptual cross-references; treat full standalone hardening as a separate, deliberate promotion wave when a given note becomes a submission target.

## What would change my mind?
- Evidence that a dependent note’s core argument cannot be followed without internal references (then we should inline the minimal missing derivation or add standard citations).
