# Q155 — Red Team

All attacks fail:
1. Algebra ω_φ²=M/r₀³: verified by independent substitution ✓
2. T_τ factor: confirmed from both metric and energy approaches ✓
3. No contradiction with Remark 3.2 (precession=ω_φ/ω_r≠1, different issue) ✓
4. "Gauge accident" defensible (coordinate-specific simplicity) ✓
