# C46 Debate: Should the Conformal D=4 Filter Live in the Planck-Area Paper?

## Hard Question
Does adding the conformal D=4 operator simplification to the Planck-area draft dilute its central thesis (half-density normalization \(\to\) universal area scale), or strengthen it as supporting evidence?

## Current Resolution
Include it as a **clearly separated heuristic subsection**:
- It strengthens the broader claim that half-density scalarization has structurally special behavior in \(D=4\), but
- it is not the same mechanism as the scale sieve (H2.5) and must be labeled as such.

If it grows, it can later become its own short note (“operator-simplicity filter”), but for now it belongs as an auxiliary, non-driving observation.
