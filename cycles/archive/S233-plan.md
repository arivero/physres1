# S233 — Plan: Derivative counterterm scaling from Seeley-DeWitt hierarchy

HD-D5.3 covers the mass counterterm (a₀ contribution, Λ^{D-2}).
The wave function renormalization δZ comes from a₁: integrand shifts
from t^{-D/2} to t^{1-D/2}, giving Λ^{D-4}. Each coefficient reduces
divergence by Λ². In D=4: mass ∝ Λ², wave function ∝ ln Λ, higher finite.
