# S202 — Execution

## Actions
1. Overwrote blackboard 0 with heat kernel bi-half-density content.
2. Spawned reviewer subagent with "rigorous pure mathematician" persona.
3. Reviewer added inline [REVIEWER] annotations confirming:
   - Core mathematics correct
   - Caveats: Riemannian/Euclidean context needed, VVD sign convention,
     distributional limits, parallel transport interpretation
   - Seeley-DeWitt coefficient formulas verified
   - Functional determinant formula correct with regularization caveat
4. Reviewer suggested additional references (Gilkey, Berline-Getzler-Vergne,
   Synge, Christensen, Getzler, Witten 2021).

## Outcome
Blackboard 0 reviewed and ready for promotion (C242).
