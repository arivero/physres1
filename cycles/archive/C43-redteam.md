# C43 Red Team

## Failure Modes
1. The “avoid BV” decision is forgotten after context resets and the repo drifts back into known-land expositions.
2. The avoidance note is phrased as a hard prohibition, blocking useful minimal orientation sentences.

## Mitigations
- Record it in `docs/research-state.md` as a steering preference (“no dedicated cycles unless requested”).
- Allow minimal outlook mentions but keep them non-load-bearing.
