# Q03 Debate

## Question
Is the added D3.5a “delta weights” remark essential, or could it be moved to `paper/notes/` to keep the main narrative lighter?

## Working Resolution
Keep it in the main manuscript as long as it stays within a few lines and directly clarifies the already-present \(\delta(\nabla f)\) and “square-root delta” language.
