# Q20 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5f

## Goal
Check coherence, readability, and claim scope after adding D1.5f.

## Checks
1. Read D1.5b through D1.5f as one sequence.
2. Verify assumption transitions are explicit (clock choice -> covariant candidate -> invariant limits -> minimal rule).
3. Guardrail scan on `paper/main.md` for cycle-label leakage.

## Acceptance Tests
- Sequence remains linear and non-contradictory.
- No overclaim beyond branch-scoped statements.
