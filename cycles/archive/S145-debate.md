# S145 Debate: Feshbach resonances

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Feshbach resonances are THE experimental tool for accessing the unitarity limit — connects theory (Remarks 5.1-5.5) to experiment.
- First observation was in bosonic sodium (Inouye 1998), not in a fermionic system.
- The BEC-BCS crossover in K-40 (Regal-Greiner-Jin 2004) demonstrated the full RG trajectory experimentally.
