# C281 — Execution
Inserted Remark 5.2c (stability–precession duality at q=2) after
Example 5.2b in relativistic. +3 lines (265→268 at this point).

The remark shows the stability factor 1+(2-q)γ² at q=2 equals
γ²ω² where ω is Remark 3.2's precession frequency. Unconditional
stability ⟺ real precession at all speeds.
