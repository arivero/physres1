## Hard question
Can a 73-line paper with 1 reference be Tier 1?

## Resolution
Yes. The paper is a "referee-safe witness" (stated in the title). Its purpose is to record one explicit, elementary observation about action-angle conjugacy in central potentials. It achieves that purpose completely within 73 lines. The single reference is sufficient because the mathematical content is standard Fourier analysis on the circle — it doesn't need a long bibliography to anchor elementary facts. Adding 1-2 more references is a quality improvement, not a structural necessity.
