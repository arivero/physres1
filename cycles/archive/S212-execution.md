# S212 — Execution

## What was done
Identified the unifying role of d/2 across three manifestations in the
delta-objects paper: identity kernel scaling, heat kernel convergence,
and Sobolev embedding threshold. All are the same geometric fact about
the half-density bundle.

## Blackboard
No blackboard needed — analysis is compact, went directly to C248.
