# S249 — Execution
The parallel is mathematically correct: both arise from integrating a
conservation-form equation across a discontinuity. However, the settings
differ fundamentally (time-domain ODE vs space-domain PDE), and a 3-line
remark would need too much qualification to avoid being misleading.
Decision: NOT promoted.
