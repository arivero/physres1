# C62 Debate: Too Implementation-Heavy for Theory Draft?

## Question
Does D1.5j introduce excessive measurement-engineering detail for the current manuscript stage?

## Current Resolution
Keep it compact:
- it operationalizes D1.5i without committing to a specific instrument,
- it is brief and framed as minimal pipeline, not full data-analysis protocol.
