# Q177 Plan: Referee pass on C294 exact nontrivial kernel witness

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C294`: Euclidean harmonic-oscillator exact kernel witness in Appendix 10.6

## Goal
Referee-pass C294 for formula correctness, scope hygiene, and consistency with Package A narrative.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q177-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `notebooks/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Mehler kernel formula and semigroup statement are coherent.
- Regulator flow statement is consistent with D12.1/D12.2 style.
- Scope boundary (`omega>0`, Euclidean) is explicit and non-overclaiming.

## Acceptance criteria
- PASS/FAIL with one concrete next-cycle recommendation.
