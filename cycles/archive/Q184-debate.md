# Q184 Debate: Is the symmetry-defect remark too much functional analysis for a path-integral section?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Section 6 is about the path integral (time-slicing, ordering, continuum limit). Does a formal-symmetry/deficiency-index discussion belong here, or should it be deferred to a dedicated operator-theory appendix?

## Resolution
The remark earns its placement. D4.1b raises the alpha-discretization family as a witness for ordering ambiguity; the immediate follow-up question is "does physics select a preferred alpha?" D4.1c answers this with a four-sentence argument: symmetry of the generator forces alpha = 1/2. The deficiency-index discussion is subordinate (a scope caveat, not the main claim) and is compressed to one sentence. Removing it to an appendix would break the argumentative chain at the point where the reader most needs the answer. The remark is shorter than D4.1b itself and maintains the same technical density as the surrounding material (D4.2, D5.1a).
