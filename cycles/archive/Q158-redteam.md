# Q158 Red-Team

**Potential objection**: "The remark claims Section 5.2 evaluates a singular kernel at coincidence, but Section 5.2 only mentions G₀(0,0;E) in Examples/Remarks, not in the main text."

**Response**: Example 5.2a and Remark 5.2b are *part* of Section 5.2 (standard mathematical convention: examples/remarks are subsections). The remark's forward-reference is correct. No issue.
