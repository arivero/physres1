# C109 Red Team: What a referee would attack in Remark HD-D1.3a

Date: 2026-02-12

## Likely referee objections
- **"The distinction between half-density conjugation and Yamabe is well-known"**
  - Mitigation: the remark does not claim novelty for the distinction itself; it claims that making the distinction explicit is necessary for the hypothesis ladder in the companion planck-area note (PA-H2.6a). The remark serves an organizational role.
- **"You should cite a source for the conformal Laplacian / Yamabe operator"**
  - Mitigation: if this paper becomes a submission target, add a standard reference (e.g. Parker & Toms, "Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime", or Wald). Currently a dependent note, so deferred. If needed, spawn B17.
- **"The conformal-class restriction limits the usefulness of the D=4 filter"**
  - Mitigation: addressed in S72-debate.md. The conformal class is the natural domain because scalarization-gauge changes are conformal rescalings of the reference half-density.
