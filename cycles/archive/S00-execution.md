# S00 Execution

## Draft Deltas
1. Created `blackboards/2026-02-09-half-density-scale-from-RG.md` to clarify:
   - what “\(d\)” refers to in the half-density \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) weight (spatial vs spacetime vs configuration),
   - how RG-invariant transmutation scales can supply the scalarization constant demanded by H2.3+H2.4 when H2.5 is relaxed,
   - why the \(d=4\) specialization naturally yields an area scale (separate from identifying it as Planckian).
2. Recorded concrete promotion candidates and open questions at the end of the note.

## Status
Completed.
