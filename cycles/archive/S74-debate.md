# S74 Debate: Is the quadratic-symbol result worth promoting?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The quadratic-symbol ordering computation extends Section 10.2's example. Is this a genuine advance or just a textbook exercise?

## Assessment
**Worth promoting**, for three reasons:

1. **Structural novelty**: the linear case (D9.1) gives only a multiplication O(ℏ) correction. The quadratic case reveals a **differential** O(ℏ) correction plus an O(ℏ²) potential — qualitatively richer. This demonstrates that ordering ambiguity scales with momentum degree, which is not stated in the manuscript.

2. **Physical relevance**: the position-dependent mass case (kinetic energy on curved 1D space) is the canonical example where ordering ambiguity matters. Comparing left, Weyl, and Laplace-Beltrami orderings concretely grounds P9.1's "controlled O(ℏ) corrections" claim.

3. **Cross-thread bridge**: the half-density conjugated Laplacian resolves the ambiguity geometrically (eliminates the first-derivative term). This closes a loop between thread 6 (ordering) and thread 2b (half-densities) that was previously only implicit.

## What should NOT be promoted
- The full operator-algebra derivation (too detailed for the appendix)
- The Weyl kernel cross-check (verification, not exposition)
- The general "degree n" claim (would need proof by induction, not just n=1,2)
