# Q160 Red Team

**Attack vector**: The claim "loop integrals involve products of propagators G(x,y)² at coincident points" might suggest a naive pointwise product, whereas QFT actually uses operator-product expansions or dimensional regularization schemes that circumvent the distributional product issue.

**Defense**: The remark correctly identifies the *mathematical obstruction* that motivates renormalization — the Schwartz impossibility explains *why* such schemes are necessary. The connection is conceptual, not computational.

**Outcome**: The remark accurately frames the conceptual link between Schwartz's theorem and QFT UV divergences. PASS.
