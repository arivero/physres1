# Q164 — Plan
Referee review of C280: insertion of Remark 5.2a (self-adjoint extension as
quantum impulse condition) into papers/dirac-probes-corners-impulses/main.md.

Review criteria:
1. Mathematical correctness of matching condition ψ'(0⁺)-ψ'(0⁻)=(2mg/ℏ²)ψ(0)
2. Placement between Example 5.2a and Remark 5.2b
3. Cross-reference to Theorem 3.2 (classical impulse jump)
4. Cycle label leak check (no C280, S246, Q164, etc. in manuscript)
5. Duplication check (cornerstone + other satellites)
