# S229 — Plan: Dirac-probes free-particle propagator from time-slicing

Section 4.5 has the time-sliced path integral but no remarks. Add a remark
showing the Gaussian integrals evaluate exactly to K = (m/(2πiℏT))^{1/2}
× exp(iS₀/ℏ), independent of N. The prefactor is √(m/T) = Van Vleck
determinant, connecting to the half-density theme.
