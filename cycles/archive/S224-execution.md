# S224 — Execution: Delta-objects d=2 resolvent example

## Outcome
Drafted Example 4.1b (d=2 delta potential: logarithmic divergence and transmutation
scale) as a companion to Example 4.1 (d=1).

Content: rank-one perturbation formula applied to d=2, showing how the running
coupling g(Λ) = 2πℏ²/(m ln(Λ/α)) cancels the Λ-dependence exactly to give
the physical bound-state condition κ=α.

Key features:
- Exact Λ-cancellation (not just asymptotic)
- E = -ℏ²α²/(2m) determined entirely by RG-invariant scale
- Forward reference to Example 5.1a for scalarization perspective
- Backward reference to Jackiw 1991 (already in bibliography)
