# S284 Red Team: Odd-d Scale-Supplier Table

Date: 2026-02-14

## Failure modes
1. **Overclaiming the parity obstruction**: stating "odd d is impossible" when the correct statement is "odd d is impossible under the monomial sieve." The transmutation route works in any d.
2. **The YM loophole**: someone might argue that g_d (unsquared) should count as an admitted coupling, since it appears in the covariant derivative D = d + g_d A. If so, the parity obstruction has a potential escape in specific dimensions. Mitigation: PA-H2.7a specifically uses action coefficients with canonical normalization; the covariant derivative coupling is a derived quantity.
3. **Treating a^{3/2} as "natural"**: the d=3 scalarization constant a^{3/2} is well-defined but involves a fractional power of the transmutation scale. A critic could argue this is just as "unnatural" as taking fractional powers of couplings. Mitigation: the distinction is that PA-H2.5 constrains dependence on couplings (input parameters), not on derived physical observables (output scales). Lambda_* is output, not input.
4. **Circular logic risk**: using "transmutation supplies a scale in any d" to claim scalarization universality, when transmutation itself may not occur in every d (e.g., d=1 has no marginal coupling for standard models).

## Mitigations
- State conclusions with explicit hypothesis labels (PA-H2.5a, PA-H2.13, PA-H2.7a).
- Do not claim universality across all d; instead classify which d allows which mechanism.
- Keep the d=1 and d=5 entries honest: transmutation requires a marginal/relevant coupling, which may not exist in standard models in those dimensions.
