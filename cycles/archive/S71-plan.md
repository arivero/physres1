# S71 Plan: Enumerate RCP structural predictions (falsifiability)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Address the open DX01 anomaly "RCP falsifiability / tautology risk" by systematically enumerating the concrete structural predictions that RCP (P10.1) makes across its three legs (partition, representation, scale).

## Parent anomaly
`DX01` — "RCP falsifiability / tautology risk" (docs/anomalies.md)

## Method
1. Read the RCP formulation in Section 10.3 (P10.1, D10.1a, D10.1, H10.1).
2. For each RCP leg (C_t, Q_ℏ, R_Λ), trace through Sections 3–8 and identify every point where the manuscript derives a consequence from a compatibility/closure requirement.
3. Classify each prediction by falsifiability strength (strong = directly checkable, medium = structurally constrained, weak = organizational/definitional).
4. Assess whether the tautology objection (anomalies as both violations and confirmations) survives the enumeration.
