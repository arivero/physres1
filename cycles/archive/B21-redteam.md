## Failure modes
1. **Citation placement**: Each citation is placed at the point where the relevant result is invoked. [Hormander2003] in Remark 2.2 (distributional pairing), [Nauenberg2003KeplerArea] in Section 4.4 (Newton's polygon), [BatesWeinstein1997] and [FeynmanHibbs1965] in Section 4.5 (half-density and path integral), [AlbeverioGesztesyHoeghKrohnHolden2005] and [Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials] in Section 5.2 (delta potentials). All placements are appropriate.
2. **Missing citations**: The satellite could cite more references (e.g., Gelfand & Fomin for Weierstrass–Erdmann), but the current 6 are sufficient to anchor all key claims and restore the References section.
3. **Build-script normalization**: The update_references.py script reordered the references by citation order in the text. This is correct behavior.
