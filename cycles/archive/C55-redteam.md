# C55 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Ambiguous caveat:** readers cannot tell which branch corresponds to D1.5b.
2. **Overcompression:** missing domain condition for the proper-time branch.
3. **Narrative break:** caveat appears to retract rather than refine the previous remark.

## Mitigations
1. Name both clocks explicitly (\(dA/dt\), \(dA/d\tau\)).
2. Keep \(GM<2\dot A_\tau c\) in the promoted text.
3. End with a two-part takeaway (robust low-mass / sensitive high-mass).
