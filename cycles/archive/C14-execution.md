## Follow-up Draft Deltas (`papers/rg-fundamental/`)
1. Added a worked singular-QM computation for the \(2\)D delta interaction:
   - explicit cutoff loop integral,
   - subtraction-defined renormalized coupling,
   - beta function \(\beta(g)\),
   - RG-invariant bound-state scale (dimensional transmutation).
2. Added a pointer to the related \(1\)D contact-interaction RG study `[BoyaRivero1994Contact]`.
3. Added a short scheme-dependence note (finite subtraction shift) and showed it rescales the RG-invariant scale.
4. Added an explicit ladder-tree (bubble-chain) recursion/cancellation demonstration plus a toy rooted-tree/Hopf-algebra coproduct/antipode identity.
5. Added a semigroup-vs-group clarification: coarse-graining maps are semigroups; coupling running can look invertible only after truncation/closure assumptions.

## Main Manuscript Delta
1. Added `10.5` to `paper/main.md` as a concise explicit RG computation (2D delta), with labeled derivations and an RG-invariant physical scale.

## Bibliography / Sources
1. Ingested arXiv:`hep-th/9411081` into `sources/9411081-51727cbf.md`.
2. Registered the key `[BoyaRivero1994Contact]` in `paper/bibliography.md`.

## Status
Completed: `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` now contains (i) a nontrivial beta function in a singular QM model, (ii) scheme dependence, (iii) an explicit rooted-tree identity/recursion, and (iv) a semigroup-vs-group clarification.
