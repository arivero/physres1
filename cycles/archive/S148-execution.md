# S148 Execution: Casimir effect as force from boundary conditions

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 1 on Casimir effect: vacuum mode restriction by conducting plates, E_C/A = -π²ℏc/(720d³), F/A = -π²ℏc/(240d⁴), regularization scheme independence, experimental verification.
2. Reviewer (QFT vacuum effects expert) found:
   - Energy and force formulas: CORRECT.
   - Zeta function argument: ζ_H(-1/2) was imprecise — should be ζ(-3). Fixed by stating "zeta-function regularization" generically in promoted remark without specifying the wrong argument.
   - Fermionic Casimir effect repulsion: correct with antiperiodic boundary conditions.
   - Experimental references: all correct.
3. Promoted as Remark 5.7 in fermionic mediators Section 5 (after Remark 5.6 on Feshbach resonances).
