## Failure mode 1: "Borderline object" is vague
The claim that the half-density bundle is "the borderline object
whose sections scale at the exact dimensional rate" could seem like
empty language.

**Mitigation**: The remark ties it to a concrete consequence: the
scalarization scale length^{d/2} of Section 5. The reader can verify
that this is the same d/2 from Sections 2 and 4.

## Failure mode 2: Page creep
194 lines, still 4pp. Acceptable.
