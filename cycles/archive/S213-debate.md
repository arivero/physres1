# S213 Debate

## Hard Question
Is the Maslov index remark too advanced for a paper about delta distributions?

## Resolution
No. The paper already discusses:
- Van Vleck determinant (Section 3.5)
- Caustic divergence (Example 3.5b)
- Half-density = amplitude pattern (Section 3.3)

The remark resolves an open thread: Example 3.5b says "the semiclassical
approximation breaks down" at caustics but leaves it there. The remark
explains that the half-density framework resolves this — which is the
paper's central thesis. Omitting this would leave a loose end.

The claim is standard (Bates–Weinstein 1997, cited in the paper's bib).
