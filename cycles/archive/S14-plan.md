# S14 Plan

## Goal
Stay close to quantization: clarify why defining quantum amplitudes via oscillatory action weights *forces* introducing a dimensionful “action-scale” parameter (ħ-like), and how the same parameter appears as a regulator/smoothing scale for delta-normalized kernel composition.

## Scope
1. Write a blackboard note with:
   - the dimensionless-exponent argument \(e^{iS/\hbar}\),
   - the stationary-phase small-parameter role of \(\hbar\),
   - the short-time kernel normalization (delta limit) showing where \(\hbar\) enters the prefactor.
2. Record at least one clear promotion candidate (main paper or follow-up drafts).

## Non-Goals
- No BV/BRST discussion.
- No bibliography ingestion.
- No manuscript edits in this cycle.

## Acceptance Tests
1. New blackboard note exists in `blackboards/` with at least one explicit computation (Gaussian/stationary-phase or short-time kernel scaling).
2. Note identifies a concrete minimal promotion target (one paragraph max).
