# C264 — Plan: Dirac-probes Remark 4.5a (free-particle propagator)

Promote S229 study into dirac-probes paper. Add Remark 4.5a after the
time-sliced path integral formula (Section 4.5): exact Gaussian evaluation
gives K = √(m/(2πiℏT)) exp(iS₀/ℏ), independent of N. Prefactor is
Van Vleck determinant √(m/T), connecting to half-density theme.

Target: +3 lines, stay within 5pp.
