# S259 — Plan
Study the critical exponent shift from q_crit=3 (Newtonian) to q_crit=2 (SR)
for centrifugal-barrier dominance in effective potentials of power-law forces.

**Goal:** Formalize the mathematical argument for why the critical exponent
drops by exactly 1, trace it to the energy-momentum relation (p²/2m vs pc),
and draft a standalone remark (Remark 3.1b) suitable for insertion near
line 82 of the relativistic-central-orbits paper.

**Acceptance tests:**
1. Clear derivation of q_crit=3 from the Newtonian centrifugal barrier ~1/r².
2. Clear derivation of q_crit=2 from the SR centrifugal barrier ~1/r.
3. Physical interpretation: the shift is exactly 1 because the ultrarelativistic
   KE is linear in p (not quadratic), lowering the centrifugal 1/r power by 1.
4. A 2-3 sentence draft remark for the paper.
5. Assessment of promotion value.
