# C297 Debate: Is this bridge editorial or technical?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does linking D9.1f to D10.1a add real technical value, or is it only editorial cross-referencing?

## Options
1. Treat as editorial and defer.
2. Promote explicit bridge now as technical clarification of what `theta` contains.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
Without this bridge, domain-parameter data can look detached from RCP formalism. Explicitly encoding it into `theta` improves conceptual rigor.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Makes future Q passes less likely to flag section-to-section disconnect.
