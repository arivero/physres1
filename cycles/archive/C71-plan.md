# C71 Plan: Promote ISCO Derivation Into Relativistic Central Orbits Draft

## Goal
Promote S44 into `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` by adding a timelike circular-orbit + ISCO subsection.

## Scope
- Add a new subsection `4.3 Timelike circular orbits and ISCO` with:
  - circular-branch formulas for \(L^2(r)\) and \(E^2(r)\),
  - stability criterion \(r>6M\) and ISCO statement,
  - one-line \((E,L)\) at ISCO.

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript edit is substantive and matches existing Section 4 conventions.
- `cycles/C71-execution.md` logs manuscript diffstat.
