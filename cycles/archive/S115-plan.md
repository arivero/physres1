## Goal
Add Remark 6.3 (EBK quantization formula) to the action-angle satellite, concretizing the general semiclassical statement in the Outlook. The Arnold–Liouville–EBK formula I_k = (n_k + α_k/4)ℏ directly shows that quantum numbers select the torus (actions) while angle variables remain uniformly distributed — the semiclassical counterpart of the quantum witnesses in Examples 6.1 and 6.2.
