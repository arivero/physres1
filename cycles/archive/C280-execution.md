Inserted Remark 5.2a (self-adjoint extension as quantum impulse condition)
after Example 5.2a in dirac-probes. +3 lines (253→256).

The remark bridges Sections 3.2 (classical impulses) and 5.2 (delta potentials)
by showing the matching condition ψ'(0⁺)−ψ'(0⁻)=(2mg/ℏ²)ψ(0) is the quantum
analog of Theorem 3.2's momentum jump, with the key distinction that the
quantum "impulse" depends on the solution itself (self-consistent boundary
condition vs external forcing).
