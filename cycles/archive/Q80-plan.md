# Q80 Plan: Light coherence pass on main paper after 14+ satellite cycles

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle (required)
- DX06 recommendation #3: "Light Q on main paper for coherence after 14 satellite cycles."

## Goal
Check whether the main paper's half-density, RG, and companion-reference content is still coherent with the current state of the planck-area and rg-fundamental companion papers (after S82–C126).

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q80-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Companion-note references: do they remain accurate and appropriately vague?
- Half-density discussion (Section 6): consistent with PA-D1.4a, PA-E5c, PA-H2.6b?
- RG discussion (Section 8): consistent with RG-D1.2a Wilsonian derivation?
- Notation: d vs D conventions compatible across papers?
- No stale claims or outdated scope statements?
