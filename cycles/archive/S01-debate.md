# S01 Debate

## Question
Is H2.5 a physically motivated constraint (e.g., perturbative analyticity around a distinguished limit), or is it only an aesthetic selection rule? What would count as evidence either way?

## Current Resolution (working)
Treat H2.5 as a *conditional* sieve: it becomes meaningful only after specifying an admissible-coupling criterion (e.g., analyticity near \(G\to 0\) or a UV-completion limit). Do not present it as “forced”; present it as a deliberately strong hypothesis whose consequences can be compared across branches.
