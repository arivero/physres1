# D22 Debate: Is cross-thread linking additive or distracting?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Current question
Will linking threshold material to RCP improve architecture, or merely add conceptual noise?

## Current stance
Tentatively defer. Candidate insertion points exist, but value gain is unclear without a broader navigation-edit pass.

## Iteration 2 addendum
A bounded candidate now exists; deferral remains reasonable because insertion is stylistic/navigation-oriented, not correctness-driven.

## Iteration 3 addendum
Navigation gain is now measurable; this supports deferral discipline by rejecting high-load cross-links even when rhetorically appealing.

## Re-anchor addendum
Debate narrowed to discovery content only; style/navigation linkage is excluded from D scope.

## Closure addendum
Final answer: additive conceptual novelty was not demonstrated; close D22 rather than extend with editorial placement work.
