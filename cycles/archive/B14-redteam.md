# B14 Red Team: bibliography entry risks

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes
- **Incorrect bibliographic data:**
  - Risk: DOIs, page numbers, or year could be wrong.
  - Mitigation: Data sourced from B13 web search results which cross-checked multiple databases. DOIs follow standard format.

- **Pourciau2003 PENDING indefinitely:**
  - Risk: manuscript cites a reference we haven't acquired.
  - Mitigation: Pourciau2003 is a "critical analysis" citation, not a load-bearing anchor. The manuscript's claims do not depend on Pourciau's specific arguments. If needed, institutional access or ILL can resolve.

- **Hidden bibliography debt:**
  - Risk: other references from B13 (Nauenberg 1994, Erlichson 2003, Chandrasekhar 1995) are not added.
  - Mitigation: only the two references cited in the manuscript need entries. The others were identified in B13 for context but are not referenced in prose.
