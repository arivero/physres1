# Q77 Debate: Referee pass on C121

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Should the resolvent dimensional error invalidate the S83 study cycle?

## Resolution
No. The structural claims of S83 (Van Vleck / transmutation separation via Lippmann–Schwinger, multiplicative combination, κ_* supplying the length^{d/2} scale) are all transformation-law and algebraic statements that do not depend on the specific dimensions of G₀. The error was in dressing these correct structural claims in incorrect dimensional bookkeeping. The corrected blackboard and manuscript remark retain the structural content.

The Q cycle caught the error before it could propagate further — this is exactly what Q cycles are for.
