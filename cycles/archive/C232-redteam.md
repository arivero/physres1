# C232 Red Team: Remark 4.11 failure modes

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes
- Scope explosion (opens mathematical physics tangents): **mitigated** — confined to a single Remark; references (Glimm–Jaffe, Aizenman, Fröhlich) are authoritative but brief, no expansive discussion.
- Missing key construction (φ⁴₄ triviality not derived here, but cited): **intentional** — triviality is conjectured, not proven; acknowledging the open problem is more honest than asserting rigor.
- Weak anchoring to Remark 2.5 (Borel summability): **strengthened** — cross-reference explicitly threads Borel connection from renormalization (Section 2) through RG (Section 4) to constructive foundations.
- Balaban mention seems abrupt: **context-tested** — mathematical physics community recognizes Balaban as canonical YM constructor; mention is brief and well-placed.
