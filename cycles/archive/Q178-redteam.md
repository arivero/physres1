# Q178 Red Team: Referee attacks on C295

Date: 2026-02-14

## Likely referee objections
- "Short-time limit statement lacks explicit test-function formula."
  - Mitigation: add one-line weak-limit formula only if demanded in later Q.
- "Could be merged into previous cycle."
  - Mitigation: keep future micro-hardening bundled unless directly flagged by Q pass.
