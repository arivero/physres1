# Q134 — Debate

## Hard question
Is the "one geometric fact" claim overreaching?

## Resolution
No. The three manifestations all stem from the scaling weight of
sections of the half-density line bundle |Ω|^{1/2}. The half-density
weight d/2 is the defining property of this bundle. The reviewer
noted it's "bold but defensible."
