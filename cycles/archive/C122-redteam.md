# C122 Red Team: Promote S84 minimal-hypotheses summary

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes

### 1. Dense paragraph
- Risk: 4 lines packing 4 claims + 4 justifications may be hard to parse.
- Mitigation: the remark uses the same labeled hypothesis notation as the surrounding text (PA-H2.1, PA-H2.4, PA-H2.5a). Readers of Section 3.1 are already tracking these labels.
