# C22 Debate

## Question
What is the minimum we must say in the cornerstone paper about half-density scalarization and scale so that the dependent “area-scale” paper feels motivated, without importing Planck-scale speculation into `paper/main.md`?

## Current Resolution (working)
Keep `paper/main.md` strictly structural: half-densities are intrinsic for coordinate-free composition; any “universal scale” enters only after extra universality hypotheses. Put the area/Planck selection mechanism entirely in `papers/planck-area/main.md`, and reference it with a single forward pointer.
