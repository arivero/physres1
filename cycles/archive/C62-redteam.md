# C62 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **False precision:** formulas interpreted as a complete end-to-end inference method.
2. **Missing uncertainty channel:** residuals reported without error propagation.
3. **Scenario lock-in:** note read as applicable only to one observation modality.

## Mitigations
1. Keep “minimal pipeline” wording explicit.
2. Mention uncertainty handling in concluding sentence.
3. Keep formulas modality-agnostic (direction/range/LOS velocity abstraction).
