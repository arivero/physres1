## Verdict: PASS (after Q137 sign fix)

1. Remark 2.1: compositional argument is standard (Bates-Weinstein Ch. 7).
   Softened claim accepted. No overclaiming.
2. Example 3.4a: sign error caught by Q137 and fixed. Final version correct.
3. Cross-references to companion note are appropriate for a satellite paper.
