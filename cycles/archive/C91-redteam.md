# C91 Red Team: Risks in the Notation-Bridge Micro-Wave

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Still confusing (bridge too short or too jargon-heavy):
  - Mitigation: define \(b,h,\alpha\) in plain language (refinement factor, ruler, representation label) and keep to one paragraph.
- Accidental scope creep into new formalism:
  - Mitigation: do not add new claims; only clarify mapping between already-defined operators.
