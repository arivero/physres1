# S147 Red Team: Lattice gauge theory blackboard

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Compact U(1) phase transition: blackboard said "first-order" but it is second-order in 4D. Fixed by omitting U(1) contrast from promoted remark.
- Clay Prize description: tightened to "confinement and a mass gap" rather than just area law.
