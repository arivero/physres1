# Q15 Execution: Quality Pass on Promoted SR Stability Section

## Checks Run
- Read-through of `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` Sections 2–6.
- Verified the stability inequality \(1+(2-q)\gamma^2>0\) reproduces the Newtonian condition \(q<3\) in the \(\gamma\to1\) limit.
- Quick scan for accidental cycle-label strings in the draft (none found).

## Findings
- Scope is explicit and disciplined (“mechanical SR + external scalar potential”); the stability result is framed as a kinematic witness, not as a covariant two-body theorem.
- Notation is consistent with the earlier SR circular-orbit section (\(L,\gamma,q,c\) are used uniformly).
- No edits required in this pass.
