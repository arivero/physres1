## Remark 4.2 — accept as-is
The "Born level" qualifier is standard EFT language and the remark's purpose is structural (connecting the contact expansion to ERE), not a precision matching calculation. Adding resummation details would bloat the remark beyond its scope.

## Remark 2.3 — fix both errors
The sign error is unambiguous (fails on f(x)=x, [0,1]). The Simpson's claim is factually wrong: the corrected trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule are distinct formulas achieving the same O(h⁴) order. Both fixes applied.
