# S252 — Debate
This is the strongest of the S250-S253 batch — it creates a clean callback
from Section 4.2 to Section 2's hypotheses using standard functional-analytic
language already present in the paper (Remark 2.2 uses L^1_loc, Remark 2.2a
cites du Bois-Reymond). The W^{1,∞} \ C¹ classification is precise and
non-trivial. However, the paper is at 7pp and must not grow further.
If a future revision targets PRD-length, this remark should be first in line
for inclusion.
