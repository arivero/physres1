## Failure Modes
1. **Overreach**: claiming the half-density formalism "solves" caustics.
   Mitigation: the remark says "projection artifact" and cites
   Bates–Weinstein, not original work.

2. **Technical error in metaplectic claim**: the double-cover Mp(2n)
   structure is well-established (Littlejohn 1992, Bates–Weinstein 1997).
   No novel claims here.

3. **Scope creep**: the remark is ~8 lines and stays within Section 3.5's
   existing Van Vleck discussion. No new sections or dependencies.
