## Failure Modes
1. Getting bogged down in symplectic/Jacobi-field formalism instead of showing the simple block-matrix mechanism.
2. Writing the note in a way that looks like a claim about functional determinants without caveats.

## Mitigations
- Keep it strictly finite-dimensional with a quadratic function (exact Gaussian integration) and then a short stationary-phase remark.
- End with a clearly labeled “template for the continuum” paragraph.
