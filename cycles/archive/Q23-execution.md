# Q23 Execution: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5i

## Checks Run
- Reviewed D1.5b through D1.5i in `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
- Verified D1.5i provides explicit test equations and model declaration items (projection, clock, reconstruction).
- Guardrail check:
  - `rg -n 'C[0-9]{2}' paper/main.md` (clean).

## Findings
- D1.5 sequence remains coherent and progressively clarifying.
- Observability criterion is concrete and consistent with preceding non-planar caution.
- No manuscript edits required in this pass.
