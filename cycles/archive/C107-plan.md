# C107 Plan: Promote H4.0c (RG-side D=4 echo) into paper/main.md

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Promote the S70 finding into the manuscript: add Heuristic H4.0c immediately after H4.0b in Section 6 of `paper/main.md`, noting that D=4 is also special on the RG side through gauge-coupling marginality and YM conformal invariance.

## Source
- `cycles/S70-execution.md` (promotion candidate block)
- `blackboards/2026-02-12-rg-side-d4-echo.md`

## Scope
- Insert one new heuristic (H4.0c) after H4.0b in `paper/main.md`.
- No bibliography changes needed (no new citations introduced).

## Acceptance criteria
- `paper/main.md` contains H4.0c.
- Diffstat shows nonzero additions.
- Guard checks pass (no cycle tags, no transcript mentions).
