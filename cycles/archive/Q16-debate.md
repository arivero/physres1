# Q16 Debate: Is the \(2L_P\) Floor Too Strong as Wording?

## Question
Should the text say “Planck-length floor” at all, or should it use weaker language to avoid over-reading a model-derived asymptotic?

## Current Resolution
Keep the wording, but bound it tightly:
- state the floor as an asymptotic of the specific SR-mechanical continuation under fixed \(\dot A_0\),
- avoid any implication that this is a universal lower bound in GR/QFT,
- preserve the existing caveat sentence in D1.5b.
