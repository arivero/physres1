# C97 Debate: How to present the \(D=4\) cancellation without overclaiming

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Should the \(D=4\) cancellation in the conformal expansion be presented as a “hint” toward deeper structure, or strictly as a checked simplification?

## Options
1. Present as a hint (suggestive language, possible follow-up).
2. Present strictly as a checked simplification with an explicit scope disclaimer.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
This note is meant to be a clean kernel/half-density semantics guide; interpretive claims would require additional evidence and anchors and are not needed for the central message.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- If a stronger interpretation becomes a target, spawn a bounded `S` (and likely `B`) cycle to compare against the conformal/Yamabe Laplacian and standard conformal-covariance statements.
