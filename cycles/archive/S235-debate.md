# S235 — Debate

The exact Kepler third law ω² = M/r³ in Schwarzschild coordinates is a
well-known but under-appreciated result. It complements the ISCO and
precession remarks by showing what does NOT change from Newton to GR
(coordinate orbital frequency) versus what does (proper period, stability).
