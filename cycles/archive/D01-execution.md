# D01 Execution: Promote a Minimal Action–Angle Clarification into `paper/main.md`

Date: 2026-02-10

## Decision
- Chosen target: add a short remark and micro-derivation in `paper/main.md` clarifying that in central potentials, \(L_z\)-eigenstates have uniform azimuthal distribution, so classical orbit pictures require wavepackets/superpositions.

## One-sentence novelty claim (non-manuscript)
“Sharp actions/quantum numbers in integrable central motion imply delocalized conjugate angles; the classical orbit picture arises from semiclassical packets, not from single stationary eigenstates.”

## Scope disclaimer (non-manuscript)
- No attempt to define a global self-adjoint ‘angle operator’; use the safe separation-of-variables witness \(\psi\propto e^{im\phi}\).
- Keep the insertion short and aligned with the manuscript’s stationary-phase narrative.

## Updates made
- `docs/research-log.md`: add a short entry opening this main-paper strengthening wave.

## Spawned cycles (planned)
- `C88`: promote the remark into `paper/main.md` and rebuild the PDF.
- `Q46`: referee pass on `C88`.
