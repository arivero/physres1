# Q97 Execution: Broad referee pass on cornerstone
Date: 2026-02-13

## Checks
1. **Section 5.3 cross-ref to Dirac Probes** (line 432): Reads well. Parenthetical style matches established pattern (HD-D1.3, RG-D1.2a, RG-D1.7). Now 6th satellite cross-reference.
2. **D5.1a Moyal product** (lines 799-812): Computations verified in Q96. Reads well between the Moyal formula and H5.1.
3. **D4.2b cross-ref to action-angle** (line 689): Natural placement — the remark already discusses angular delocalization and the cross-ref expands it to HO witness.
4. **General flow** (Sections 5-7): No disruption. New content integrates smoothly.
5. **Line count**: 1452 (up from 1435 at session start).
6. **PDF**: 39 pages, 522KB, builds cleanly.
7. **No raw LaTeX commands** (\\textit, \\textbf, \\emph): clean.
8. **Guard checks**: no cycle labels, no conv_patched.

## Verdict
Cornerstone in good shape. All additions integrate smoothly. No fixes needed.
