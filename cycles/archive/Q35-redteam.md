# Q35 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Misread as atomism:** readers interpret the note as endorsing minimal chunks.
2. **History expectations:** readers expect Democritus/Hilbert discussion and sources.
3. **Vagueness:** controlled-refinement idea stays purely verbal.

## Mitigations
1. Keep explicit definition "not indivisibility" (already present).
2. Keep note historically neutral; open a `B` cycle if history is later added.
3. Keep at least one concrete toy refinement model (Riemann sums) (already present).
