# Q160 Plan

Referee review of Remark 5.3a (Why δ² is undefined — the Schwartz impossibility).

Check: (1) Schwartz impossibility theorem statement correctness, (2) QFT connection via G(x,y)² at coincident points, (3) cross-reference to Remark 5.2b's d/2 exponent, (4) table hierarchy interpretation (rows 1-2 safe, 3-4 single diagonal, 5 genuine products), (5) placement after summary table before Outlook.
