# B07 Execution: Wilson Loop / Confinement Anchors for the String-Tension Branch

## Work
- Added two bibliography ledger entries:
  - `[Greensite2003Confinement]` (OA arXiv review; Wilson loop, area law, string tension).
  - `[Wilson1974Confinement]` (classic original; marked `PENDING` for OA status).
- Generated a local markdown capture of the OA review for internal use (in gitignored `sources/`).

## Result
The repo now has a solid OA anchor for Wilson-loop/area-law confinement language, enabling a future `S`/`C` cycle to write the string-tension-as-area-scale bridge without relying on transcript guidance.

## Next
- `S56`: attempt a kernel-level bridge note from Wilson-loop area law to an effective area scale \(\sigma^{-1}\), keeping hypothesis branches separated.
