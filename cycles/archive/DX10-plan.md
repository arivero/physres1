Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Assess overall project state after this session's work (S97-S100, C140-C142, Q94-Q96, DX10).
Identify highest-value actions for remaining time.

## Checks
1. Cornerstone line count and section coverage.
2. All 9 satellites — are any below optimal length?
3. Cross-reference network completeness.
4. Anomalies or deferred items.
5. What would move the project toward publication readiness?
