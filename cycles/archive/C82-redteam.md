# C82 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Scope creep**: the remark becomes a mini gauge-theory lecture.
2. **Branch mixing**: readers confuse emergent \(\sigma\) with fundamental \(\alpha_\ast\).
3. **Citation mismatch**: the reference does not explicitly state the definitions as written.

## Mitigations
1. Keep to a single operational definition sentence plus one citation.
2. Keep the remainder of E4a explicitly in the transmutation branch and leave \(\alpha_\ast\) as a separate hypothesis.
3. Re-check the review if we later tighten wording further.
