# C270 — Execution

Inserted Remark 4.3f after Remark 4.3e (line 192), before Section 5.
Three lines covering:
1. Coordinate frequency ω_φ² = M/r₀³ derived from L, E on circular orbit
2. Proper period T_τ = T_t √(1-3M/r₀); at ISCO T_τ/T_t = 1/√2
3. Coordinate Kepler law is "gauge accident"; proper period encodes curvature
