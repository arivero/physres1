# S51 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Too many parentheticals**: H0.2 becomes cluttered.
2. **Triviality**: readers dismiss the calculus witness as "just calculus".
3. **Misleading analogy**: readers think calculus subtraction is literally QFT renormalization.

## Mitigations
1. Keep it to one short parenthetical sentence.
2. Phrase as a "toy witness" and immediately return to the operational meaning (divergent refinement needs subtraction/flow).
3. Avoid "is renormalization"; use "shares the regulate/subtract/limit grammar".
