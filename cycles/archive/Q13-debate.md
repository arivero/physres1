# Q13 Debate: Should We Normalize \(E,L\) “Per Unit Mass” Everywhere?

## Question
GR geodesic literature often normalizes \(E,L\) by rest mass; SR force-law derivations do not.

## Resolution
Keep SR section dimensionful and kinematic; keep GR section in \(G=c=1\) with a clear “restoring units” paragraph. If we expand the paper, revisit a uniform normalization convention.
