# Q45 Red Team: Likely Referee Attacks on `C87`

Date: 2026-02-10

## Objections
- “This is too obvious / textbook.”
  - Mitigation: emphasize the *foundations* role (preventing a category error in ‘potential from fermions’ analogies) and keep one explicit matching witness.
- “Your argument conflates classical sources with quantum external states.”
  - Mitigation: keep the statement strictly about linear sourcing by commuting backgrounds; treat inter-particle interactions as EFT/operator statements.
- “Lecture-page citation is weak.”
  - Mitigation: be ready to run `B10` to add a second independent OA anchor (e.g. a PDF lecture note) if required.
