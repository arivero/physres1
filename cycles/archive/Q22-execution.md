# Q22 Execution: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5h

## Checks Run
- Reviewed D1.5b through D1.5h in `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
- Verified D1.5h is explicitly non-planar cautionary and keeps branch scope (projection needed for scalar rates).
- Guardrail check:
  - `rg -n 'C[0-9]{2}' paper/main.md` (clean).

## Findings
- The D1.5 sequence remains consistent and layered without contradiction.
- Scope discipline is preserved: non-planar note is cautionary, not a claim of full 3D dynamical completion.
- No manuscript edits required in this pass.
