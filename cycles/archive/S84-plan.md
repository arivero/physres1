# S84 Plan: Minimal hypotheses for "half-density scale → Planck area" (Open Problem #4)

Date: 2026-02-13

## Thread
Half-densities / Planck-area ladder (thread 2). Targets Open Problem #4.

## Goal
Map the hypothesis chain PA-H2.1 → ... → PA-D1.3 and identify:
1. Which hypotheses are forced (not optional): PA-H2.1, PA-H2.2
2. Which are physical principles (non-trivial): PA-H2.4 (background-free), PA-H2.5a (integrality)
3. Which are conventions: PA-H2.3 (dimensionless f)
4. Where the "more than dimensional bookkeeping" content lives

The key question: what exactly makes the argument non-trivial (beyond "d/2 = d-2 iff d=4")?

## Scope
One blackboard note. No manuscript edits.
