# DX09 Execution: Cross-thread connection probe + next-direction assessment
Date: 2026-02-13

## Anomalies
Read `docs/anomalies.md`: no open entries. All 4 previously opened entries are RESOLVED.

## Cross-satellite links
Currently, no satellite paper references another satellite's labels. The cornerstone references HD-D1.3 (half-density satellite) and now RG-D1.2a, RG-D1.7 (RG satellite). Future work could add cross-satellite links (e.g., RG-fundamental's RG-H1.12 mentions half-density kernels, which connects to the half-density-QFT satellite).

## Roadmap assessment (unstarted items ranked by value/cycle)
1. **B: Dirac Probes** — 3–4 cycles, low risk. 80% content exists in cornerstone Section 5. Fastest path to Tier 1. Pairs with delta-objects satellite.
2. **C: Ordering/Discretization** — 3–5 cycles, moderate risk. Extends cornerstone Section 10.2. Two existing blackboards as anchors.
3. **A: RCP Standalone** — 4–6 cycles, high conceptual payoff but scope-creep risk. Requires tight cap on formalism.
4. **D: Rooted Trees** — 4–6 cycles, needs heavy B work on Hopf algebras. Publishable in applied math circles.
5. **F: Renormalization Computation** — 3–4 cycles, low risk but somewhat redundant with RG-fundamental.
6–7. **E/J** — deprioritized (high cost, weak project alignment).

## Principle evolution
No update needed to v4 (RCP as principle). The current session's work (cross-references, content expansion) is consolidation, not discovery.

## Recommendation
**Immediate (this session):** expand delta-objects or fermionic-mediators paper with one worked computation. Both are thin (138 / 95 lines) and have clear expansion targets.
**Short-term (next sessions):** start item B (Dirac Probes) as satellite #9.
