# Q132 — Debate

## Hard question
Is the "structural parallel" observation publishable content, or just pedagogy?

## Resolution
The dirac-probes paper is explicitly a pedagogical companion note. A structural
remark connecting its mollifier theorem to the cornerstone's polygonal
construction and time-slicing bridge is exactly in scope.
