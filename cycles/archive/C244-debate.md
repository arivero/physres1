# C244 — Debate

## Hard question
Should the remark claim "D=4 selection" or just "D=4 matching"?

## Resolution
Used "matching" language per reviewer guidance. The remark states the
mathematical fact (V = (1/6)R matches ξ_conf only at D=4) without
claiming this alone selects D=4. The conditional interpretation
("IF conformal coupling is required AND half-density normalization,
THEN D=4") is left implicit — the reader can draw this conclusion
from the conjunction of HD-D1.3b with the Planck-area paper's
hypothesis ladder.

This is the conservative choice. A stronger "selection" claim would
need to justify why conformal coupling is independently forced, which
is a separate argument not yet developed in this paper.
