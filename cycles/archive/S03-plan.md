# S03 Plan

## Goal
Clarify (blackboard-first) what H2.5b (“perturbative analyticity”) can *mean* when couplings are dimensionful, and whether it is consistent with demanding a universal \(\mu\)-independent scalarization constant.

## Scope
1. Write a blackboard note proposing a concrete formulation of H2.5b in terms of **dimensionless couplings at scale \(\mu\)**, and analyze:
   - when a \(\mu\)-independent \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) constant can exist under analytic dependence,
   - how this relates to the monomial/integrality sieve and to transmutation.
2. Extract ≥2 promotion candidates for `papers/planck-area/main.md` (without promoting in this cycle).

## Non-Goals
- No new bibliography ingestion (network may be unavailable).
- No manuscript edits.

## Acceptance Tests
1. New blackboard note exists and explicitly distinguishes: integrality, analytic-at-\(g(\mu)=0\), and transmutation.
2. Promotion candidates are clearly marked.
