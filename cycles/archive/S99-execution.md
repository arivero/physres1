# S99 Execution: Assess and draft Dirac Probes cross-reference
Date: 2026-02-13

## Assessment
Section 5.3 of the cornerstone is the natural anchor for a cross-reference to the Dirac Probes satellite. The satellite's Theorem 2.1 (explicit hypotheses) and Section 4 (worked model + N-impulse bridge) provide the expanded treatment that the cornerstone compresses.

Drafted cross-reference for C141 promotion.
