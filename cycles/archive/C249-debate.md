## Hard Question
Is citing Hamilton1834 in a paper about delta distributions anachronistic?

## Resolution
No. Section 3.5 is specifically about the Van Vleck determinant, which is
literally ∂²S/∂q∂Q — Hamilton's principal function's mixed Hessian. The
paper already cites Van Vleck (1928) and Morette (1951); Hamilton (1834)
completes the historical lineage: Hamilton → Van Vleck → Morette → Feynman.
The delta-objects paper uses the principal function S_{cl} explicitly in
the propagator formula (line 115), so citing its inventor is appropriate.
