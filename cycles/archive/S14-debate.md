# S14 Debate

## Question
Is \(\hbar\) best viewed here as:
1) a “regulator” in the action exponential (small-parameter for stationary phase), or
2) a “conversion constant” needed only to make \(S\) dimensionless in the phase?

## Working Resolution
Treat both as the same structural role:
\(\hbar\) is the unique dimensionful constant that (i) makes the oscillatory weight dimensionless, and (ii) controls the \(\hbar\to0\) limit in which amplitudes concentrate on stationary extremals. In kernels, the delta-normalized short-time prefactor forces \(\hbar\) into the normalization once composition is required.
