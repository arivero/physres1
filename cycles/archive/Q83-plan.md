# Q83 Plan: Referee pass on delta-objects for Tier assessment

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C128`: relativistic-central-orbits promoted to Tier 1. Next Tier 2 candidate: delta-objects.

## Goal
Full referee pass on `papers/delta-objects/main.md` to assess issues and Tier readiness.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q83-*.md` only

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: section structure and mathematical claims.
- Notation: consistent conventions.
- Citations: currently none — assess gap.
- Math: key identities (delta composition, stationary phase, point interaction).
- Encoding: Unicode artifacts.
- Cross-references: internal paths must be generic.
- Tier assessment.
