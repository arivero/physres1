# B05 Plan: OA Anchors for SR/GR Relativistic-Orbit Thread

## Goal
Add independent, OA-stable anchors for the SR/GR orbit thread opened by S24 (SR inverse-square circular-orbit constraint).

## Scope
1. `paper/bibliography.md`
   - Add one OA anchor for the *special-relativistic Kepler problem* (inverse-square central force).
   - Add one OA anchor for *GR geodesics / black holes* (effective potential, circular orbits, photon sphere baseline).
2. `sources/` (untracked)
   - Ingest both arXiv PDFs via `skills/source-to-markdown`.
3. Logs
   - Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
1. Two new keys exist with arXiv anchors; OA acquisition status updated.
2. Sources are ingested into `sources/` (untracked).
3. No manuscript edits required in this cycle.
