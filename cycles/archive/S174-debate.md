# S174 Debate
Key correction from reviewer: the circular entropic bound is NOT from Maassen-Uffink (1988) or Beckner (1975). The correct reference is Bialynicki-Birula & Madajczyk (1985) for the circle, with BBM (1975) for position-momentum. Also: coherent states do not saturate the entropic bound — removed that claim.
