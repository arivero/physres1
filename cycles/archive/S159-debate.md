# S159 Debate: Anomalous magnetic moment

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- g-2 is the vertex complement to vacuum polarization (Section 3.1) and pair production (Remark 3.4).
- The most precise QED test — directly demonstrates fermion-loop effects on electromagnetic properties.
- Muon sensitivity to heavy physics connects to EFT framework of Section 4.
