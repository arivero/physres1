## Failure modes

### 1. Over-claiming the Wilsonian derivation
- Risk: saying "the Wilsonian analysis is now done" when the outlook originally asked for a QFT example.
- Mitigation: the updated text carefully says RG-D1.2a is in the QM model and that a QFT example "with a nontrivial fixed-point structure" remains as an extension. No over-claim.
