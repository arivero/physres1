# S71 Red Team: RCP prediction enumeration failure modes

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes
- Overcounting by listing consequences that are definitional rather than predictive:
  - Mitigation: the falsifiability classification explicitly marks 5 of 11 predictions as "weak/organizational." The resolution rests on the 4 strong predictions, each with an explicit alternative that would break closure.
- Undercounting by missing predictions from companion papers or recent additions:
  - Mitigation: the search covered all of Sections 3–8 and 10.3–10.5, plus the H4.0x sidebar. Companion papers were not searched because RCP predictions should be self-contained in the main manuscript.
- Claiming resolution of the anomaly when the tautology risk is only mitigated, not eliminated:
  - Mitigation: the claim is not that RCP is as falsifiable as a quantitative physical prediction; it is that RCP has the same epistemic status as general covariance — restrictive but not uniquely selective. The anomaly register entry was about tautology (vacuous truth), which is refuted by the existence of explicit closure-breaking alternatives.
