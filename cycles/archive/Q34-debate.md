# Q34 Debate: Should We Name Confinement Diagnostics Here?

## Question
Should `papers/planck-area/main.md` explicitly mention Wilson loops/area law when talking about \(\sigma\)?

## Current Resolution
Not in this pass. Keep `Remark E4a` as hypothesis bookkeeping. If we want to anchor confinement diagnostics, open a dedicated bibliography cycle first.
