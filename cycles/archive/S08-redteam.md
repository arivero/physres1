## Failure Modes
1. Slipping into hand-waving about functional determinants without a clear finite-dimensional model.
2. Overclaiming “Van Vleck = Hessian” without specifying variables and boundary conditions.

## Mitigations
- Keep everything in finite-dimensional calculus; only gesture at the path-integral case.
- Use a simple elimination/Schur-complement remark to explain why mixed Hessians appear after integrating out intermediate variables.
