# C56 Execution: Promote Invariant-Candidate Remark

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5d` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` after D1.5c.
- Introduced a compact source-covariant specific-angular-momentum scalar \(\ell\) and its source-frame relations to \(\dot A_t\) and \(\dot A_\tau\).
- Added the inverse-square gravitational branch
  \[
  r(M,\ell)=\frac{\ell^2}{GM}\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{GM}{\ell c}\right)^2},
  \]
  with domain \(\ell>GM/c\), and noted \(\ell=2cL_P\) reproduces D1.5c.
- Kept explicit scope language: candidate/outlook, not a universal conclusion.
