# C49 Debate: How Much of This Belongs in the Planck-Area Draft?

## Question
Should the generic-\(q\) derivation be:
1) a full new section (risk: distracts from half-density normalization), or
2) a short remark immediately after the inverse-square derivation (preferred)?

## Current Resolution
Keep it as a compact remark: it sharpens what is and is not special about the inverse-square witness, and it cleanly connects the witness to dimension via standard Green-function scaling.
