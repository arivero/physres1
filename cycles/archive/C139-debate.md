## Hard question
Should a citation be added for vacuum polarization?
## Resolution
Not strictly necessary — it's a universal textbook result. If a referee requests it, Peskin-Schroeder or Weinberg QFT I would be the natural anchor. For now, the formula is self-contained and the paper's 4 existing references cover the relevant physics.
