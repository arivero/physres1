# Q136 Execution: Referee Review of C250

## Verdict: CONDITIONAL PASS → fixes applied → PASS

### Referee persona: Careful historian of physics and mathematician

### Issues found (ranked by severity):

**HIGH:**
1. Issue 2B: "exactly, not as a limiting statement" phrasing misleading —
   the discrete equality IS exact, but the continuous law requires a limit.
   **FIX APPLIED:** → "algebraic identity at each polygon step, exact for any
   finite number of impulses."

**MEDIUM:**
2. Issue 2A: Parallelogram construction underspecified — reader may not see
   why cC ∥ BS follows from central impulse.
   **FIX APPLIED:** → Added "adds a radial velocity component."

3. Issue 2C: Scholarly debate on Newton's limit (Pourciau 2003) not
   acknowledged. **DEFERRED** — Nauenberg citation is sufficient for this
   paper; Pourciau is noted in the central bibliography.

4. Issue 2E: Nauenberg2003 source not yet ingested into sources/.
   **DEFERRED** — bibliography cycle.

**LOW:**
5. Issue 1B: "Soft junction vs hard junction" terminology not defined
   elsewhere. **ACCEPTED** — clear enough in context.

### Result after fixes: PASS
