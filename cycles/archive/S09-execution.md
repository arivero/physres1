# S09 Execution

## Work
- Wrote a half-density-first formulation of the point interaction as a rank-one bi-half-density kernel \(g|0\rangle\langle0|\).
- Checked the dilation scaling of the point-supported half-density \(\delta^{(d)}(x)|dx|^{1/2}\) to make the \(d/2\) exponent explicit.
- Recorded a conditional “RG invariants can supply scalarization scales” interpretation for marginal cases (e.g. 2D transmutation), keeping convention vs physics separation explicit.

## Result
- New note: `blackboards/2026-02-10-point-interaction-as-half-density-kernel.md`.

## Status
Completed.
