# S225 — Execution: Relativistic hierarchy remark

## Outcome
Drafted Remark 4.3c (Hierarchy of circular-orbit radii) connecting photon sphere
r=3M, unstable band 3M<r<6M, and ISCO r=6M.

Key points:
- r_ISCO/r_ph = 2 exact
- SR has no unstable band (stable at all r with L>K/c)
- Entire unstable band is a curvature effect
- Connects to Remarks 4.3a-b attribution
