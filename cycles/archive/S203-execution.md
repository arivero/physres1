# S203 — Execution

## What happened
Wrote BB1 with self-adjoint extensions classification. Spawned reviewer
subagent (skeptical applied mathematician persona).

## Reviewer findings
1. d=1: correct; noted full U(2) family vs delta subfamily.
2. d=2: mostly correct; missing hbar^2 in running coupling numerator.
3. d=3: correct.
4. d>=4: **ERROR** — used H^1 instead of H^2 (operator domain is H^2).
5. Green function singularities: all correct.
6. epsilon^{-d/2} connection: imprecise (resolvent exponent is d-2, not d/2).
7. RCP connection: good.

## Status
Completed. Errors corrected during C243 promotion.
