# C121 Red Team: Promote S83 into planck-area (Remark PA-E5c)

## Failure modes

### 1. "For d=4, the same structure gives Λ_*^{-2} = area" is unverified
- Risk: the d=4 claim extrapolates from a d=2 model. No d=4 computation was done.
- Mitigation: the dimensional structure [G₀] = length^{-d}, [T] = length^d is d-independent. The claim is about dimensional analysis, not about the specific dynamics.The remark says "the same structure gives" (a structural prediction), not "this has been computed."
