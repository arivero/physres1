# S150 Execution: Effective field theory as refinement hierarchy

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 1 on EFT as refinement hierarchy.
2. Reviewer (particle phenomenologist) found:
   - EFT expansion formula: CORRECT.
   - Matching condition formula: CORRECT.
   - Wilson date "1969" was WRONG — should be early 1970s. Fixed by citing "Weinberg, 1979" as primary EFT reference in promoted remark.
   - Warsaw basis attribution (Grzadkowski et al., 2010): CORRECT.
   - Dimension-6 suppression by 1/Λ²: CORRECT.
3. Promoted as Remark 4.4 in uncuttable Section 4 (after Remark 4.3 on lattice gauge theory).
