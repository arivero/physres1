# C61 Execution: Promote Observability Criterion

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5i` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` after D1.5h.
- Promoted an explicit observability criterion for projected areal-rate postulates:
  - required model declaration (projection, clock, reconstruction),
  - projected observable formulas,
  - projected torque evolution equation as test signal.
- Kept scope tied to perturbed-orbit branch and measurement interpretation.
