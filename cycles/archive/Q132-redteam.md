## Failure mode 1: Reviewer says "this is obvious"
Any limit-under-regularity argument has some finite-stage identity.

**Mitigation**: The specific "exact at finite scale" property is
non-trivial. S206 debate provides counterexample (Fourier series).

## No other failure modes identified. PASS with no conditions.
