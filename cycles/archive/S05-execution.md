# S05 Execution

## Work
- Wrote a blackboard note clarifying the coordinate-free meaning of the “delta kernel” as the Schwartz kernel of the identity operator on half-densities.
- Computed the near-diagonal scaling \(y=x+\varepsilon v\) to exhibit the intrinsic \(\varepsilon^{-d/2}\) factor.
- Connected the scalarization-gauge choice \(\sigma_\ast\sim L_\ast^{-d/2}|dx|^{1/2}\) to the appearance of a universal \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scale in scalar representatives (and showed the identity kernel becomes \(k_{\mathrm{Id}}=L_\ast^d\delta\)).
- Added a rank-one “square-root delta” interpretation of the contact interaction kernel \(V=g|0\rangle\langle 0|\) as a tensor product of two distributional half-densities supported at a point.

## Result
- New note: `blackboards/2026-02-10-delta-as-half-density-kernel.md`.

## Status
Completed.
