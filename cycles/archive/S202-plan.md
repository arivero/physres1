# S202 — Plan

## Goal
Study the heat kernel expansion as a bi-half-density object, preparing
content for Remark HD-D4.2 in the half-density QFT paper.

## Approach
1. Write blackboard 0 with the DeWitt-Schwinger expansion and VVD interpretation.
2. Delegate review to subagent (rigorous pure mathematician persona).
3. Incorporate reviewer feedback before promotion.

## Scope
- DeWitt-Schwinger expansion, Van Vleck determinant
- Half-density heat kernel K̃ = |g|^{1/4} K |g|^{1/4}
- Trace without √|g|
- Connection to D1.1a normalization and Section 5 counterterms
