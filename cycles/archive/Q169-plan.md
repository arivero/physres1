# Q169 -- Plan

## Goal
Referee review of C285, which promoted four changes into the relativistic
central orbits paper: Remark 3.2b (Sommerfeld fine structure connection),
Outlook item 3 (semiclassical quantization direction), references [3]-[4]
(Sommerfeld 1916, Bertrand 1873), and a citation addition to Remark 3.2a.

## Review checklist
1. Verify Remark 3.2b is mathematically correct:
   - omega^2 = 1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2) consistent with Remark 3.2.
   - Substitution K = Ze^2/(4pi eps_0), L = k hbar yields omega = sqrt(1 - Z^2 alpha^2/k^2).
   - Sommerfeld energy formula E_{n_r,k} = mc^2(1 + alpha^2 Z^2/(n_r + k omega)^2)^{-1/2}.
   - Dirac reinterpretation k -> j + 1/2.
2. Verify Outlook item 3 is well-scoped and non-redundant with Remark 3.2b.
3. Verify reference formatting for [3] and [4].
4. Check for scope creep, overclaiming, or internal inconsistencies.
5. Check page budget (PLB 6pp limit).
