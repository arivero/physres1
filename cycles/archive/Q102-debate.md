# Q102 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Decision
No changes needed. The key debate was whether the fermionic mediators subagent's "critical" sign flags were genuine errors. They were not: the subagent's own algebra was wrong. The correct beta function β(g_R) = +(m/πℏ²)g_R² is confirmed by the cornerstone's own D11.2 (Section 10.5) and by direct derivation from the T-matrix renormalization condition.
