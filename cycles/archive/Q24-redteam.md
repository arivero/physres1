# Q24 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Implementation overgrowth:** section shifts from theory framing to methods appendix.
2. **Hidden assumptions:** data channels in D1.5j treated as universally available.
3. **Premature closure:** skipping uncertainty treatment while claiming operational readiness.

## Mitigations
1. Keep D1.5j short and conditional.
2. Preserve modality-agnostic wording.
3. Follow with S36 uncertainty skeleton before further manuscript hardening.
