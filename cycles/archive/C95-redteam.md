# C95 Red Team: Risks in clarifying the reader map

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Early symbol friction persists:
  - Mitigation: keep the pointer minimal; if needed, remove the symbols from the Section 2.5 map and keep them only in Appendix 10.3.
- Scope creep into new claims:
  - Mitigation: treat edits as navigation-only; do not add new assertions or citations.
- PDF formatting regression in the blockquote:
  - Mitigation: keep lines short and avoid wide tables.
