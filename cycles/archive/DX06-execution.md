# DX06 Execution: Post-planck-area-strengthening structural sweep

Date: 2026-02-13

## Findings

1. **Main paper (Sections 8–10):** Consistent with all new planck-area results. No updates needed. Division of labor (main = structural, planck-area = scale-selection hypotheses) is clean.

2. **RG-fundamental:** Already acknowledges half-density/scalarization connection (RG-H1.12). Optional forward reference to PA-E5c, but not blocking.

3. **Anomaly register:** Zero open anomalies.

4. **RCP v4:** Confirmed valid. PA work strengthens but does not revise the principle. No v5 update needed.

5. **Unpromoted findings:** All S82/S83/S84 already promoted. No residual.

6. **Publication pipeline:** P00 v3 (planck-area with new additions) after Feb 20. RG-fundamental is Tier 1 ready for P01.

## Recommended next cycles
1. S85: explicit beta-function computation in 2D delta for rg-fundamental
2. C or Q on rg-fundamental to clear path for P01
3. Light Q on main paper for coherence after 14 satellite cycles

## No anomalies or structural concerns detected.
