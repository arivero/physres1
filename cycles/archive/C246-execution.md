# C246 — Execution

## What was done
1. Inserted Remark 2.3 in dirac-probes paper (after Remark 2.2).
2. Remark articulates the threefold "probe-then-refine" pattern:
   mollifier localization, Newton's polygon, time-slicing path integral.
3. Incorporated S206 reviewer feedback: mentions Nauenberg2003 for
   polygon convergence hedge and "controlled vertex convergence."
4. Applied Q131 fixes to relativistic orbits paper (3 edits):
   - Clarified BDF citation scope
   - Softened ω = 1/γ_circ language
   - Added post-Newtonian framing for 1/6 ratio
