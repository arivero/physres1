# Q174 Execution: Referee pass on C291 curved-manifold Package B extension

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C291`

## Findings
- PASS.
- `Derivation D9.1d` is structurally correct as a unitary-conjugation symmetry witness in curved setting.
- `Derivation D9.1e` appropriately captures the generic chart-level symmetry failure risk for naive left ordering.
- Scope is well controlled: self-adjoint extension classification remains explicitly open.
- Section 9.5 Package B status line now matches delivered content.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- `C292` (recommended): deepen Package A beyond free Gaussian witness by adding one nontrivial potential/regulator composition witness and explicit failure mode.

## Notes (non-actions)
- Main paper now has concrete Package B closure at witness level in both periodic and curved settings.
