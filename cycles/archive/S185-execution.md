Wrote blackboard 1: Stone-von Neumann theorem. Reviewed by operator algebraist. Key corrections: (1) Weyl relations form/sign (HIGH), (2) irreducibility hypothesis missing (HIGH), (3) Haag theorem conflated with SvN failure (HIGH), (4) regularizations vs CCR representations (MEDIUM), (5) renormalization claim oversimplified (MEDIUM). All applied.
