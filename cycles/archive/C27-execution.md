# C27 Execution

## Changes
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md`
   - Added `Derivation D1.2b` stating the half-density identity kernel \(K_{\mathrm{Id}}=\delta^{(d)}(x-y)|dx|^{1/2}|dy|^{1/2}\), computing its near-diagonal scaling, and showing how scalarization via \(\sigma_\ast=L_\ast^{-d/2}|dx|^{1/2}\) yields a dimensionless scalar representative \(k_{\mathrm{Id}}=L_\ast^d\delta^{(d)}\).
2. `docs/research-log.md`
   - Added a dated entry recording the promotion.
3. `cycles/index.md`
   - Updated cycle status and “Next Action”.

## Status
