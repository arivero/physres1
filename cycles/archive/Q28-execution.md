# Q28 Execution: Quality Pass on RG Section 3 (H1.1c)

## Checks Run
- Reviewed `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` Section 3 through the Section 4 transition.
- Verified H1.1c remains a "same grammar" statement (regulate/subtract/limit), not an identification of RG with weak-derivative calculus.
- Confirmed H1.1b -> H1.1c ordering is coherent (distribution toy, then weak variational extension).
- Guardrail check:
  - `rg -n 'C[0-9]{2}' paper/main.md` (clean; no matches).

## Findings
- No edits required in this quality pass.
- Section 3 remains compact and rhetorically aligned with the paper's core thesis.

## Next Spawn
- Run `S40`: map weak-derivative contact-term mechanism onto the existing 1D/2D/3D contact-flow comparison so the cross-dimensional section gains a compact conceptual bridge.
