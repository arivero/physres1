# S191 Execution: Constructive QFT blackboard for uncuttable paper Section 4

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work performed
- Wrote blackboard 1 surveying rigorous constructions: φ⁴₂ (proven), φ⁴₃ (incomplete), Gross-Neveu (well-controlled), 2D Yang-Mills (non-perturbative).
- Highlighted open problems: φ⁴₄ triviality conjecture, 3D/4D Yang-Mills mass gap.
- Reviewed by mathematical physicist persona.
- Applied 3 HIGH corrections: Gross-Neveu attribution (wrong model family), 2D Yang-Mills mischaracterization (not "solvable", more nuanced), φ⁴₃ incompleteness (not partial, genuinely open).
- Applied 4 MEDIUM corrections: precision language around "proven" vs. "conjectured", Balaban mention added for YM context, Borel summability connection noted.

## Artifacts produced
- `blackboards/1-constructive-qft-refinement-existence.md`: Survey of constructive QFT and open problems

## Result
- Blackboard is promotion-ready for Remark 4.11 capstone; establishes whether RG refinement limits rigorously exist.

## Promotion candidate (copyable block)
See `blackboards/1-constructive-qft-refinement-existence.md` for the final remark text.

## Discovery flag (fill at end of cycle)
- Did this computation reveal something unexpected? **no**
- Constructive QFT landscape is well-documented; no surprises, but proper attribution matters.

## Spawned cycles
- `C232`: promote the blackboard into uncuttable Remark 4.11
