# S64 Plan: Reader-Navigation Table for the Refinement-Compatibility Chain

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Draft a compact reader-navigation aid (table/boxed block) that maps the three compatibilities (partition/representation/scale) to:
- the operational symbols (\(\mathcal C,\mathcal Q,\mathcal R\)),
- a one-line meaning,
- where each is treated in `paper/main.md`.

## Deliverable
- `blackboards/2026-02-11-reader-navigation-compatibility-map.md`
  - includes a copyable promotion block for a future `C94` insertion into `paper/main.md`.

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S64-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Navigation block is compact (3 rows) and PDF-safe (no wide tables).
- Promotion candidate is standalone and adds no new technical claims.
