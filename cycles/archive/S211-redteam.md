## Failure mode 1: Mischaracterizing the derivation gap
The exponential form e^{iS/ℏ} IS derived from additivity +
multiplicativity (the unique homomorphism from (R,+) to (C*,×)).
So (c) in the gap analysis is weaker than stated.

**Mitigation**: True that exp is the unique continuous homomorphism.
But the additivity of the action under temporal partition is itself
an assumption (linearity in Lagrangian), not derived from (C) alone.
The gap is real.

## Failure mode 2: Overstating Costello connection
Costello's framework is for QFT on manifolds with sophisticated
machinery (BV, factorization algebras). Claiming it "is the closest"
to a QM-level RCP formalization is imprecise.

**Mitigation**: Blackboard says "might be a special case... restricted
to quantum mechanics." This is appropriately hedged.
