# C53 Plan: Promote SR Stability Result into `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`

## Goal
Promote the S26 stability result into the dependent draft as a compact new section:
- define the fixed-\(L\) energy function \(W_L(r)\),
- state/derive the SR stability condition \(W_L''(r_0)>0\) for a circular orbit \(r_0\),
- record the resulting inequality in a form that reduces to Newtonian \(q<3\) as \(\gamma\to1\).

## Scope
- Update only `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` (plus cycle logs).
- Keep it “two-pillar” style: one derivation + one clear interpretation table, no extra literature detours.

## Acceptance Tests
- The stability criterion is explicit and matches the blackboard derivation.
- The text is scoped as “SR + external scalar potential” (no overclaiming).
- `cycles/C53-execution.md` includes a manuscript diffstat from `scripts/paper-diffstat.sh --cached`.
