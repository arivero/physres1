## Hard question
Should we redefine α so that α=0 maps to standard ordering q̂p̂ (matching the common operator-ordering convention), or keep the path-integral convention where α=0 maps to prepoint evaluation at q_k?

**Decision**: Keep the path-integral convention. D4.1b is explicitly about the path integral α-prescription, so the α should mean the same thing in the text as in the formula q_α=(1-α)q_k+αq_{k+1}. Using a different α for operator ordering would create confusion. The standard Kleinert path-integral literature uses this convention.
