# S36 Plan: Uncertainty-Propagation Skeleton for Projected Tests

## Goal
Build a minimal uncertainty framework for the observables introduced in D1.5i/D1.5j.

## Scope
1. Define measurement/state vector and covariance.
2. Provide first-order propagation for \(\dot A_{\mathbf n}\).
3. Provide first-order propagation template for residual \(\mathcal T_{\mathbf n}\).

## Acceptance Tests
- Explicit Jacobian-based formulas.
- Clear statement of assumptions and limits of linearization.
