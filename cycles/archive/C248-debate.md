# C248 — Debate

## Hard question
Does this remark belong in §5 (scalarization) or §4 (point interactions)?

## Resolution
Section 5: the remark's concluding sentence connects d/2 to the
scalarization scale length^{d/2}, which is §5's topic. The remark
summarizes §2 and §4 insights in §5's scalarization context.
