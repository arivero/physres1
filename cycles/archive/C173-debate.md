# C173 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Arguments for
- WKB naturally extends the Section 3 narrative from path-integral refinement (3.1-3.4) through adiabatic (3.5) to semiclassical quantization (3.6)
- Connection formulas = "control data" is a perfect fit for the paper's theme
- Maslov index connects to Berry phase (Remark 3.5) as a topological counterpart
- Semiclassical specialist reviewed all claims CORRECT

## Arguments against
- Section 3 might be getting long (now 6 remarks) — but they're compact and each adds a distinct angle
- No citation for WKB — but the material is textbook and uncited elsewhere in the paper

## Decision
Promote. The WKB remark is the natural capstone of Section 3.
