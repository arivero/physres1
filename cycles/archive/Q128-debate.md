# Q128 — Debate

## Key decisions
1. Renamed σ → s for Synge's function rather than renaming the conformal
   factor σ in Section 3 (which is well-established notation in the paper).
2. Removed the VVD transport equation entirely rather than trying to state
   the correct (and more complicated) equation. The remark doesn't need
   a differential equation — it needs the bi-half-density conclusion.
3. Added "for the massless operator" rather than including -m² in a₁.
   The heat kernel expansion is more naturally stated for the massless
   case; the paper's focus is on curvature terms, not mass terms.
