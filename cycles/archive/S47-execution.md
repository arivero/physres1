# S47 Execution: Crisp Obstruction Lemma for the "Newton-Limit Paradox"

## Work
- Selected Candidate C ("no Lebesgue measure on path space") as the most crisp obstruction.
- Wrote a lemma statement + proof sketch in:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-no-lebesgue-measure-in-infinite-dim.md`
- Mapped the lemma to the manuscript narrative:
  - classical refinement limits can be treated as ordinary limits of sums/integrals,
  - but the moment we rely on path-space integration to enforce composition, there is no canonical measure to take a naive limit with,
  - thus "quantization" is naturally phrased as *controlled refinement data* (operator/semigroup definition, regularization, scheme choices).

## Result
Prepared a `C74` promotion target: add a short heuristic remark near `Heuristic H0.2` in `paper/main.md` stating the measure-theoretic obstruction and its operational moral.

## Next
- `C74`: promote the obstruction lemma (short heuristic/remark) into `paper/main.md`.
- Spawn a `B` cycle later to attach a standard measure-theory reference for the lemma (Bogachev / Weil style).
