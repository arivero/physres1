# S238 — Plan: Universality of mollifier convergence

Study the functional-analytic distinction underlying the safe/unsafe
classification in dirac-probes Section 5. The key insight: mollifier
convergence (Section 5.1) is universal because the integrand is continuous;
delta potential evaluation (Section 5.2) is scheme-dependent because the
kernel is singular. Goal: a 3-line remark for Section 5.1.
