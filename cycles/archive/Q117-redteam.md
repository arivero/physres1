# Q117 Red Team: Four-remark review

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Missing bibliography entries would be immediately flagged by any referee.
- No physics errors found — all formulas, attributions, and conceptual framing verified.
- Minor: Remark 5.7 "no source" phrasing could be clarified (plates are macroscopic matter, not field-equation sources).
