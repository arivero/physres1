# S20 Debate: What Counts as “Outside Scope” vs “Not Yet Written”?

## Hard Question
When `conv_patched.md` contains material, should we treat it as “outside scope” (new paper) or “missing text” (add to existing drafts)?

## Current Resolution
Use a triage rule:
1. If it directly strengthens the main spine (stationary extremes + refinement-compatible composition + half-densities) without requiring heavy new prerequisites, it is “missing text” and belongs as a small `C` insertion.
2. If it adds a new domain (SR/GR orbit classification, Wilson-loop potential definitions, historical-document hunting), it is “outside scope” and should be captured as a follow-up draft or a `B` cycle, not injected into the cornerstone paper.
3. If it’s a technical deepening of an already-referenced preprint (e.g., the full 9803035 formalization), it becomes a dedicated `S` → `C` pipeline (notes first, then promote).
