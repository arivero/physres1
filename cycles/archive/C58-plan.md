# C58 Plan: Promote Minimal Timelike-Structure Rule

## Goal
Promote S31 into `papers/planck-area/main.md` as a short rule-level remark after D1.5e.

## Scope
- Add one compact remark:
  - source-anchored timelike direction \(U^\mu\),
  - postulate on \(\ell_{(U)}\),
  - coordinate-time areal rates treated as derived.

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript is edited (not just cycle docs).
- Remark is concise and scoped to the current model branch.
- `cycles/C58-execution.md` records manuscript diffstat.
