# S18 Execution: Derivatives of the Diagonal Delta Kernel

## Work Completed
- Added a blackboard note giving a coordinate-free identity for “derivatives of the delta kernel” in half-density language and connecting it to point splitting and to derivative counterterms:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-derivatives-of-diagonal-delta-kernel.md`

## Key Identity
For the canonical bi-half-density identity kernel \(\delta_{\mathrm{diag}}\) on \(M\times M\),
\[
(\mathcal L_{V_x}+\mathcal L_{V_y})\,\delta_{\mathrm{diag}}=0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\mathcal L_{V_x}\delta_{\mathrm{diag}}=-\mathcal L_{V_y}\delta_{\mathrm{diag}},
\]
recovering \(\partial_{x^\mu}\delta(x-y)=-\partial_{y^\mu}\delta(x-y)\) in local coordinates.
