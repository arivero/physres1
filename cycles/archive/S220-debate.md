# S220 — Debate

## Why these two targets?
1. Example 5.2b concretizes the abstract criterion with specific numbers — readers can immediately check the formula.
2. Remark 4.3b extends the SR/GR comparison from Remark 4.3a (qualitative: ISCO exists/doesn't) to quantitative (minimum L).

## Alternative considered
- Astrophysical scales table (Mercury, neutron star) — rejected as too tangential for a theory note focused on structural patterns.
- Contact-interaction cross-reference to delta-objects — rejected as forced; the papers don't share enough formalism.
