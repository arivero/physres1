# C230 Debate: Hubbard-Stratonovich Promotion

## Remark Placement
**Question**: Should Remark 6.5 be before References or integrated into Section 6 text?
**Decision**: Before References. Completes systematic construction of HS path-integral formalism.

## Content Detail Level
**Question**: How much Fierz detail for a remark?
**Decision**: Keep caveat concise: "basis-choice dependent". Readers seeking details will find them in cited works.

## Example Necessity
**Question**: Should BCS and NJL examples be in body or footnote?
**Decision**: Body. Both are canonical HS applications. Essential context for understanding trace-log importance.

## RG Matching Scope
**Question**: Deep dive into matching procedure or high-level note?
**Decision**: High-level note. Matching is non-trivial (controls saddle-point validity). Prevents false claims.

## Outcome
Remark 6.5 completes Section 6 with rigorous path-integral construction. Physics and scope approved.
