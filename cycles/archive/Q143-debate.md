# Q143 — Debate

## Should a reference be added for the W-E second condition?
Optional. The result is textbook-standard (Gelfand & Fomin §4, Giaquinta &
Hildebrandt). The remark states the result without proof, which is appropriate
for its role (companion to Theorem 3.1). Not adding a reference keeps the
paper's citation list focused on its core contributions.
