# Q119: Quality review of six satellite remarks

## Goal
Referee-level review of six newly added remarks across three satellite papers:

1. **fermionic-mediators-contact-limits**
   - Remark 4.4: Weinberg power counting
   - Remark 6.3: Nuclear pion exchange

2. **action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials**
   - Remark 5.4: Aharonov–Bohm effect
   - Remark 7.6: Coherent-state path integral

3. **uncuttable-controlled-refinement**
   - Remark 2.7: Zeta regularization
   - Remark 4.7: Asymptotic safety

## Success criteria
For each remark:
- Physics correctness (formulas, attributions, connections)
- Coherence with surrounding content
- Bibliography anchoring (all inline citations backed)
- Grade: PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL

## Method
Systematic read-through with focus on:
- Formula verification
- Citation checking (anchored vs pending)
- Logical flow and integration with paper structure
- Identification of any errors or gaps
