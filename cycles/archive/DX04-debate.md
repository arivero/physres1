# DX04 Debate: Should the Van Vleck × transmutation separation be promoted into the main paper or the Planck-area draft?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
S78 found that the Van Vleck prefactor (geometric half-density weight) and the transmutation scale (dynamical scalarization constant) are structurally independent in the 2D delta kernel. Should this be promoted into the main paper (near P11.1 / Section 10.5) or the Planck-area draft (near PA-E5a / PA-D1.4)?

## Recommendation
Promote into the **Planck-area draft** (near PA-D1.4 or after PA-E5a). Reasons:
1. The main paper's Section 10.5 is a computational appendix — it proves transmutation exists, but does not discuss how it interfaces with the half-density formalism.
2. The Planck-area draft's Section 4 (PA-D1.4) already discusses Van Vleck prefactors as half-densities, and Section 3.3 (PA-E5/PA-E5a) already discusses the 2D delta as a transmutation witness.
3. The structural separation is most relevant to the Planck-area narrative (how geometry and dynamics each contribute to the scalarization scale).
4. A remark after PA-E5a (e.g., PA-E5b) would naturally follow the hierarchy and add the kernel-level detail.
