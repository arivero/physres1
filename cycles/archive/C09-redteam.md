# C09 Red Team

## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. Example covers one symbol class; broader functional classes are not enumerated.
2. Operator-domain subtleties remain outside mainline scope.

## Evidence Needed
1. Add a second worked symbol (optional) if broader representative coverage is required.
2. Provide domain details in a later technical appendix if strict operator claims are needed.

## Closed Items
1. Ordering/discretization ambiguity now has an explicit worked formula.
2. `C04` and `C05` bridge no longer relies only on narrative claims.
