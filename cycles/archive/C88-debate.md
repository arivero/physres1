# C88 Debate: Is the action–angle remark worth adding to the main paper?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
Does a short angle-delocalization remark improve the cornerstone manuscript, or is it an unnecessary detour?

## Decision
Include a single bounded remark tied directly to the paper’s “classical recovery = semiclassical concentration” theme.

## Rationale
It prevents a common category error (“stationary state = classical orbit”) with minimal scope impact.
