Date: 2026-02-13
## Blackboard
Created `blackboards/2026-02-13-quantum-revivals-action-angle.md`: dispersion/revival analysis, rigid rotation vs anharmonic case, hydrogen T_rev ∝ n³.
## Review
Subagent (semiclassical specialist): all 5 claims correct. Recommendation: include as brief forward pointer (2-3 lines), not full discussion, since paper's scope is static conjugacy.
## Promotion → C165
Remark 5.1 in action-angle satellite Section 5 (3 lines).
