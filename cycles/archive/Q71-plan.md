# Q71 Plan: Referee pass on C116 (Remark PA-E5b)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C116`: Promote S78 Van Vleck × transmutation kernel-level separation into Planck-area draft

## Goal
Referee-pass the C116 manuscript changes for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q71-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: theorem vs heuristic labels match content.
- Notation: consistent, no dimension mixups.
- Citations: load-bearing claims are anchored or explicitly marked `PENDING`.
- Cross-references: verify PA-D1.4, PA-H2.1, PA-H2.2–H2.4 all exist and match.
- Reader flow: one-screen sanity check.

## Acceptance criteria
- A concrete list of edits to do next, expressed as spawned `S/B/C/D` cycles (not direct edits).
