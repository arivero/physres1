# C245 — Debate

## Hard question
Is "SR precession = 1/6 GR" a meaningful physical statement, or is it
an artifact of comparing incompatible force models?

## Resolution
The 1/6 ratio has a clear physical meaning in the post-Newtonian
expansion: the SR contribution is the "1PN kinematic" term (from
velocity-dependent mass), while the remaining 5/6 comes from
spacetime curvature. Both are present in the full GR result.

The model caveat (external potential vs. field-mediated force) is
acknowledged in Section 6's outlook. For the paper's purposes,
the point is that SR represents a "partial refinement" of Newtonian
mechanics, capturing a definite fraction of the full GR effect.
