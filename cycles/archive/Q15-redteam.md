# Q15 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Scope creep:** the note becomes a standard “relativistic Kepler problem” survey rather than a refinement-witness collection.
2. **Hidden assumptions:** readers miss that the SR stability analysis assumes an external scalar potential.
3. **Overconfidence:** stability inequality is later cited as “known” without an anchor.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the “Purpose” section explicit and maintain a short “Next Waves” queue.
2. Repeat the model scope sentence at the start of the stability section (already done).
3. If the inequality becomes load-bearing outside this note, open a `B` cycle to anchor it to an OA source.
