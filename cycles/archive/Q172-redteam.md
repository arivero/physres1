# Q172 Red Team: Referee attacks on C289

Date: 2026-02-14

## Likely referee objections
- "The one-loop QFT witness depends on normalization conventions that are not stated explicitly enough."
  - Mitigation: in next C-cycle, add one sentence fixing the interaction normalization (`\lambda\phi^4/4!`) and domain assumptions where needed.
- "Ordering discussion still lacks operator-domain evidence."
  - Mitigation: add a concrete `S^1` domain/symmetry benchmark in Appendix 10.2 (`C290`).
