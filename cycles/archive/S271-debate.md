# S271 Debate: Is the numeric grid too toy to include in workflow evidence?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does the equal-coefficient sign table risk oversimplifying physical parameter dependence?

## Resolution
It is adequate for workflow evidence because it only validates exponent ordering, not quantitative orbit structure. Coefficient dependence remains explicitly out of scope in the promoted remark.
