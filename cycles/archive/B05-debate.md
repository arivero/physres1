# B05 Debate: Physics vs Math References

## Tension
SR central-force results often live in textbooks (not OA), while OA sources may be more mathematical.

## Resolution
Prefer arXiv sources that (i) explicitly write the SR relativistic Kepler equation and (ii) discuss circular solutions/constraints, even if framed in dynamical-systems language. For GR, use widely used OA lecture notes as a baseline anchor.
