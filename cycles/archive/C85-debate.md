# C85 Debate: Is the Rest-Energy Subtraction "Too Trivial" to Count?

## Question
Does subtracting \(-mc^2(t_f-t_i)\) risk being dismissed as a trivial constant shift?

## Current Resolution
That is exactly the point: a limit may fail to exist until we specify which constants are physically quotiented out.
The witness supports the thesis "constants are control parameters for compatibility limits" by exhibiting a concrete, unavoidable subtraction in the \(c\to\infty\) passage.
