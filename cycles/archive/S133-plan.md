# S133 Plan: Wigner function and sub-Planck structure

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study the Wigner function as the fine-grained complement to the Husimi function
already discussed in the action-angle satellite (Remark 6.4). Understand why
Husimi smoothing hides interference fringes and negativity.

## Key questions
1. What is the Wigner function of Fock states? (Laguerre polynomial formula)
2. How does Husimi relate to Wigner? (Gaussian convolution)
3. What "sub-Planck structure" means in this context (finer than ΔxΔp~ℏ cell)
