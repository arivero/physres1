# C69 Debate: Name the Formalism or Keep It Kernel-Only?

## Question
Should the promoted remark explicitly name the closed-time-path / Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, or keep it purely kernel-structural?

## Current Resolution
Keep the manuscript remark kernel-structural. If we later name specific QFT formalisms as anchors, run a dedicated bibliography cycle before expanding.
