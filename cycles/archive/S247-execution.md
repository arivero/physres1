# S247 — Execution
Found the paper already implicitly covers the progression: exact Gaussian (D4.1a,
D4.2b) → general semiclassical (D4.3 Van Vleck). Adding a 3-line remark about
"loop corrections for non-quadratic L" would create orphaned terminology without
sufficient development. Decision: NOT promoted.
