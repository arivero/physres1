# C45 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. Readers misread the D=4 cancellation as a derivation of spacetime dimension.
2. The example feels unmotivated (“why conformal metrics?”) and distracts from the kernel/half-density semantics.
3. Notation bloat: introducing \(\sigma\) and conformal coordinates adds friction.

## Mitigations
1. Add explicit “within the conformal ansatz” caveat and keep interpretive language minimal.
2. Motivate as a *worked expansion* of the conjugated operator, because this is where half-density scalarization choices show up concretely.
3. Keep the example short, and link to the blackboard note for the full derivation/check.
