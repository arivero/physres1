# C174 Plan: Wigner function Remark 6.6 in action-angle

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Promote S133 Wigner function study as Remark 6.6 in the action-angle satellite,
completing the phase-space portrait sequence (Husimi ring → coherent blob →
squeezed ellipse → Wigner fine structure).

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- New Remark 6.6 after Remark 6.5, before Section 7

Out of scope:
- Detailed Wigner function calculations beyond the Fock-state formula
- Bibliography additions (no new references needed)

## Minimum promotion bar
One remark block (~3 sentences) explaining Husimi = Gaussian-smoothed Wigner,
Fock-state Wigner formula with alternating-sign rings, and the coarse vs
fine-grained distinction.
