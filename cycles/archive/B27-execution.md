# B27 Execution: Relativistic-orbit anchor hardening

Date: 2026-02-14
Status: Completed

## Work completed
1. Added two missing entries to `paper/bibliography.md`:
   - `Sommerfeld1916FineStructure`
   - `Bertrand1873ClosedOrbits`
2. Added DOI/audit lines and OA acquisition status lines for both keys.
3. Created pending stubs:
   - `sources/pending-Sommerfeld1916FineStructure.md`
   - `sources/pending-Bertrand1873ClosedOrbits.md`

## Result
- Claims already cited in the satellite now have explicit ledger tracking and acquisition follow-up actions.
