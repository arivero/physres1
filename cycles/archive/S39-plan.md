# S39 Plan: Distribution-Derivative Variational Kernel Study

## Goal
Study how Euler-Lagrange weak derivatives fit the same regulate/subtract/limit pattern used in the RG toy derivative.

## Scope
1. Derive a weak finite-difference identity for \(\dot p\).
2. Work one jump example showing explicit delta generation.
3. Extract a concise manuscript-promotion item for RG Section 3.

## Acceptance Tests
- Derivation is internally consistent and sign conventions are explicit.
- A concrete jump example yields the expected delta term.
- Clear one-remark promotion target for `C66`.
