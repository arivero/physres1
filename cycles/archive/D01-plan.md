# D01 Plan: Promote a Minimal Action–Angle Clarification into `paper/main.md`

Date: 2026-02-10

## Goal
Select one small but foundations-relevant clarification to strengthen the cornerstone manuscript without changing its scope: in central potentials, sharp angular momentum implies delocalized azimuthal angle, so “classical orbit pictures” correspond to coherent superpositions rather than single stationary eigenstates.

This is a discovery/triage cycle only: it must not edit manuscripts.

## Novelty candidates (shortlist)
1. Promote a minimal action–angle/phase–action remark into `paper/main.md` (use existing blackboard note).
2. Add a second independent anchor for the Grassmann-source statement (hardening follow-up to the new Theme L note).

## Decision criteria
- Must strengthen reader understanding of the paper’s semiclassical/stationary-phase stance.
- Must be bounded (one short derivation block), not a new topic arc.
- Must avoid new bibliography debt unless strictly necessary.

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/D01-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- `C88`: add a short remark + micro-derivation to `paper/main.md`.
- `Q46`: referee-pass `C88` (Q answers C only).

## Acceptance criteria
- A precise insertion location is chosen (section + nearby paragraph).
- The promotion block is specified (what text/equations will be added).
