# C44 Execution: Promote S15 Micro-Model and \u03b4' Identity

## Work Completed
- Strengthened the calculus micro-model in `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` to include:
  - an explicit Taylor expansion showing the regulated \(1/\varepsilon\) divergence,
  - a finite counterterm ambiguity \(z_0\) and a renormalization condition that fixes it,
  - a short distributional “contact term” remark: \((\delta(\cdot+\varepsilon)-\delta)/\varepsilon \to \delta'\).
- Added a one-line pointer to the normalized 1D/2D/3D contact loop integral note:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-contact-loop-integrals-1d-2d-3d.md`.
- Extended `papers/delta-objects/main.md` with an explicit “\(\delta'\) from point splitting” formula (with sign fixed by pairing) and a pointer to the S15 blackboard note.

## Result
The RG draft’s motivational micro-model now mirrors the standard renormalization pattern more faithfully (divergence + subtraction + scheme fixing), while the delta-objects synthesis note gains a concrete identity tying \(\delta'\) to a regulated point-splitting limit.
