# D20 Redteam

Date: 2026-02-14

## Failure modes
1. Deferral causes the notes to rot and never get promoted.
2. Future C-cycle forgets the scope caveats and over-compresses.

## Mitigations
1. Keep a concrete trigger and recommendation in `S275` and `D20`.
2. Require C-cycle plan to cite `S272-S275` before editing `Remark P1.1a`.
