# S44 Debate: Include ISCO Numbers or Only the Inequality?

## Question
Should the promoted subsection include the numerical invariants at the ISCO (\(E=\tfrac{2\sqrt2}{3}\), \(L=2\sqrt3 M\)), or only the stability threshold \(r>6M\)?

## Current Resolution
Include the ISCO numbers as one-line outputs. They are compact and help readers sanity-check the formulas.
