Wrote blackboard 0: Deformation quantization / Moyal star product.
Key content: Moyal product formula (f★g) = f·g + (iℏ/2){f,g} + O(ℏ²), star-commutator
reproduces Poisson bracket at leading order, Kontsevich formality theorem (1997, Fields
Medal 1998) proving existence for arbitrary Poisson manifolds. Mathematical physicist
reviewer caught Kontsevich Fields Medal date (1998 not 2003). Corrected before promotion.
