# Q179 Execution: Referee pass on C296 self-adjoint extension witness

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C296`

## Findings
- PASS.
- `D9.1f` gives a valid witness-level family where domain data changes quantum content at fixed principal symbol.
- Bound-state energy expression and jump condition are consistent for the attractive-contact branch.
- `D9.1g` correctly prevents overclaiming full extension classification.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- `C297` (optional): add a brief note connecting this extension witness back to the RCP operational closure map (`D10.1a`) for tighter cross-section linkage.

## Notes (non-actions)
- Package B now has ordering, symmetry, curved-manifold, and extension-level witness coverage.
