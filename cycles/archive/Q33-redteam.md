# Q33 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Per-unit-mass ambiguity:** readers may confuse specific \(E,L\) with physical energy/angular momentum.
2. **Notation overload:** subsection adds too many boxed formulas.
3. **Comparability confusion:** mixing SR external-potential witnesses with GR geodesics.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the subsection tied to Section 4 definitions; consider adding a "specific energy/angular momentum" sentence if confusion arises later.
2. Keep the number of displayed results minimal (already compact).
3. Preserve the note's framing as parallel witnesses, not a unified interaction model.
