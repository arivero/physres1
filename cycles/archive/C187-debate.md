# C187 Debate: Mandelstam-Tamm Remark 5.3

Date: 2026-02-13

## Decisions
- Placed in Section 5 after decoherence — bridges the spatial tradeoff (Sections 3-4) to the temporal domain.
- Avoided explicit harmonic oscillator numbers (which were wrong in blackboard); stated saturation directly.
- Forward-references Example 6.1 for the coherent state verification.
