# S39 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Category drift:** conflating classical weak derivatives with quantum renormalization machinery.
2. **Sign confusion:** wrong delta sign from integration-by-parts conventions.
3. **Overgeneralization:** claiming every contact term is just a jump derivative.

## Mitigations
1. Frame as structural analogy and compatibility grammar, not identity of frameworks.
2. Keep sign conventions explicit in the promoted remark.
3. Limit claim to the demonstrated weak-derivative mechanism.
