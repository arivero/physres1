## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. The half-density discussion is still abstract; it needs one concrete short-time propagator (or groupoid) example where the normalization scale can be tracked end-to-end.
2. The \(D=4\) “area specialness” is currently dimensional; it needs a clearer statement of what is invariant under rescalings and what is convention.
3. The areal-speed cancellation derivation is clean, but its physical interpretation (quantization/discreteness input) must be labeled consistently as heuristic vs postulate.

## Evidence Needed
1. Add a short-time kernel prefactor analysis (stationary phase) showing how a \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scale enters and how it interacts with RG scaling.
2. Make the “reciprocity” statement precise: what data are assumed, and what is concluded.
