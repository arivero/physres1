# C58 Debate: Is “Minimal Structure Rule” Too Prescriptive?

## Question
Does stating a rule (“use \(U^\mu\), fix \(\ell_{(U)}\)”) prematurely freeze modeling choices?

## Current Resolution
No, because the statement is branch-scoped:
- it applies to the present central-source inverse-square model,
- it is framed as a practical rule, not universal axiom,
- it can be revised if later branches introduce different physical structures.
