# Q12 Execution: Sections 6–8 Coherence Pass

## Checks Run
- `rg -n 'C[0-9]{2}' paper/main.md` (no matches).
- Read-through: H4.0a/H4.0b, D6.0, D6.1–D6.2.

## Findings
- D6.0 cleanly complements the existing \(R_{\Lambda\to\mu}\) semigroup paragraph: it states the generic closure requirement and then points back to \(R_{\Lambda\to\mu}\) as a special case.
- Notation: using \(\mathcal G_b\) avoids collision with \(\mathcal C_t\) in RCP; \(h\sim 1/\Lambda\) is stated explicitly.
- No overclaims detected: \(\tau_b\) is framed as a compatibility/closure requirement, and “failure of closure” correctly motivates counterterms/operator enlargement.

## Fixes
- None required in this pass.
