# C298 Debate: Is this polish cycle worth it now?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Should we spend a cycle on readability pointers instead of adding new math content?

## Options
1. Skip polish and stop at technical additions.
2. Add compact pointer map to improve usability before freeze.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
After multiple technical waves, explicit navigation lowers cognitive load and reduces referee friction without altering claims.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- After this pass, main-paper wave can be considered near freeze pending commit and optional external referee pass.
