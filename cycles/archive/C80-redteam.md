# C80 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Distraction**: numerical-analysis content derails the QFT discussion.
2. **Overclaim**: readers think the fixed point \(a_\ast=1/2\) is a general RG universality statement.
3. **Notation clash**: the step size \(h\) is confused with Planck's constant \(\hbar\).

## Mitigations
1. Keep derivation short and explicitly labeled "micro-model".
2. Phrase fixed point as a property of this toy family (second-order exact-flow coefficient).
3. Keep \(\hbar\) out of the derivation; use \(h\) consistently as "resolution/step size".
