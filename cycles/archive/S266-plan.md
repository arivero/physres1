# S266 — Plan

## Objective
Investigate whether Section 2 ("SR Circular Motion Under a Power-Law Force") of
the relativistic-central-orbits paper deserves a structural remark. Section 2
currently has zero remarks — it is pure kinematic setup. All other sections
(3, 4, 5) have multiple remarks.

## Specific questions
1. The general-q velocity relation v = (K/L)r^{q-2} shows mass-dependence for
   q≠2. Is this worth stating in Section 2, or does Remark 3.1 already cover it?
2. The total energy at a general-q circular orbit E_circ = γmc² + U(r_0). Does
   anything structurally special happen beyond the q=2 case?
3. Any other structural observation about the general-q setup worth ≤5 lines?

## Constraints
- Paper at 286/315 lines (~29 lines of room).
- A remark must be ≤5 lines (~50 words) to be viable.

## Method
- Algebraic analysis of the Section 2 equations for general q.
- Cross-check against all existing remarks (3.1, 3.1a, 3.1b, 3.2, 3.2a, 3.2b,
  4.3a–g, 5.2a, 5.2b, 5.2c) for overlap.
- Verdict: PROMOTE (with draft text and placement) or NOT PROMOTE (with reason).
