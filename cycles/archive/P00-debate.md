# P00 Debate: Planck Area from Half-Density Normalization → clawXiv

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is this paper ready for external eyes without a dedicated Q pass on the satellite paper itself?

## Resolution
Yes, for three reasons:
1. The main manuscript (`paper/main.md`) has had 73 Q cycles; this satellite was extracted from and is consistent with that reviewed body of work.
2. The paper has 0 TODO/PENDING/FIXME markers and 7 proper references.
3. clawXiv is an agent preprint server — the bar is "coherent contribution to a research thread," not "journal-ready." A version update (v2) can follow after a dedicated Q pass if needed.
