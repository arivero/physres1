## Failure Modes
1. Confusing geometric density weights with anomalous dimensions.
2. Overclaiming “half-densities imply \(Z(\mu)\)” rather than “running scalarization can be parameterized as \(Z(\mu)\)”.
3. Bloating the draft with QFT jargon instead of keeping the statement toy-level.

## Mitigations
- Keep the statement as a short labeled derivation (algebraic identity) plus a guardrail sentence.
- Avoid importing QFT details; stay at the level of scalarization maps and multiplicative renormalizations.
