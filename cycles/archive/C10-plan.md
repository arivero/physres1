# C10 Plan

## Goal
Replace strict-deformation continuation with a foundational compatibility concept aligned with the paper's thesis.

## Scope
1. State a compact foundational principle linking partition, representation, and scale compatibility.
2. Map each compatibility axis to already-derived cycle results (`C01`--`C06`).
3. Keep formalism minimal and explicitly label interpretive status.

## Claims
1. The manuscript can be reframed as one compatibility program across three operations: partitioning, representation changes, and scale refinement.
2. Existing cycle derivations already supply the technical content needed for this principle.

## Risks
1. Over-axiomatizing beyond demonstrated derivations.
2. Blurring proved relations with interpretive framing.

## Acceptance Tests
1. Section `10.3` includes one labeled proposition and one labeled derivation.
2. Section `10.3` explicitly maps to prior cycle outputs.
3. Strict-deformation continuation language is removed from continuation framing.
