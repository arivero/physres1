# S60 Execution: Planck Areal Speed Circular Orbit Witness

## Work
- Derived the radius of a Newtonian circular orbit whose areal velocity is \(\ell_P^2/t_P\):
  \[
  r=\frac{4\hbar}{Mc}=4\lambda_C(M).
  \]
- Noted the Newtonian consistency condition \(v\ll c\) implies \(M\ll 2m_P\).

## Result
Recorded in:
- `blackboards/2026-02-10-planck-areal-speed-circular-orbit.md`

## Next
- Decide whether to promote this as a short remark in `paper/main.md` (Section 3) or keep it as a dependent-draft witness (`papers/planck-area/main.md`).
