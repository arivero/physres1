Date: 2026-02-13

## action-angle-indeterminacy
- Added [Sakurai2020] to References section (standard QM textbook for angular momentum).

## uncuttable-controlled-refinement
- Added References section (new) with 2 entries:
  - [BatesWeinstein1997]: half-density formalism
  - [FeynmanHibbs1965]: path integral as time-sliced refinement limit
- Fixed paths: `paper/main.md` → "the cornerstone manuscript" (2 instances)
- Fixed repo language: "In this repo" → "In the companion papers"

## Ledger
Entries 42-43 added: [Sakurai2020], [FeynmanHibbs1965].

## OA status
- [Sakurai2020]: paywalled (Cambridge UP)
- [FeynmanHibbs1965]: paywalled (classic, widely available in libraries)
- [BatesWeinstein1997]: OA (already in ledger)
