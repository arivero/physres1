# Q123 Debate: Quality Review Findings

## Remark 3.2 Assessment
**Question**: Is Fourier orthogonality assumption explicit enough for readers?
**Verdict**: PASS. Heuristic framing acceptable. Readers familiar with action-angle variables will recognize the assumption.

## Remark 5.7 Assessment
**Question**: Is N̂ vs n̂ notation confusion likely to mislead?
**Verdict**: PASS. Notation clearly defined. One style variance is minor and contextually unambiguous.

## No Blocking Issues
Both remarks are publication-ready. Minor stylistic notes are refinement suggestions, not corrections.

## Outcome
Q123: 2/2 PASS. C227-C228 content approved for final commit to main.
