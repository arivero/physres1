# S170 — Study resurgence and trans-series for uncuttable Section 2

## Goal
Investigate resurgence theory (Écalle's framework, Bender–Wu analysis,
trans-series) as background material for the uncuttable paper's Section 2
on asymptotic expansions and non-perturbative completions.

## Scope
- Bender–Wu large-order behaviour of perturbation theory.
- Écalle's alien calculus and resurgent trans-series.
- Connection to Borel summability and Stokes phenomena.
- Relevance to the "uncuttable" refinement programme.

## Output
Blackboard note summarising the key ideas, suitable for promotion as a
remark in Section 2.
