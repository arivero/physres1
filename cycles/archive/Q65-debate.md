# Q65 Debate: Any concerns with the dual citation?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Is there any reason to question the dual citation of both Nauenberg 1994 and 2018?

## Assessment
No. The two papers make complementary contributions:
- 1994: historical identification of Newton's impulse scheme as canonical/symplectic (priority).
- 2018: explicit modern "symplectic integrator" identification with numerical-analysis properties (terminology match).

Citing both is standard academic practice when a historical paper introduces the idea and a later paper makes it explicit in modern terminology.
