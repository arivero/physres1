# C229 Debate: Crossing Symmetry Promotion

## Remark Placement
**Question**: Should Remark 2.2 follow Remark 2.1 or integrate elsewhere?
**Decision**: After Remark 2.1. Logical flow: scattering amplitude → crossing symmetry.

## Content Scope
**Question**: How much detail on Grassmann obstruction vs kinematic crossing?
**Decision**: Separated explicitly. Each deserves independent discussion. Remark is concise.

## Bibliography
**Question**: Should Remark cite classical crossing references?
**Decision**: No citations in remark body (kept minimal). Full bibliography in B cycle if needed.

## Outcome
Remark 2.2 cleanly separates two orthogonal physical concepts. Physics and presentation approved.
