# S207 — Plan

## Goal
Address open question #3: Does contact-expansion universality,
combined with RCP, constrain the space of consistent low-energy
theories beyond what standard EFT already says?

## Scope
- Review the fermionic paper's universality statement (Remark 4.6):
  different UV completions → same C₀ → same low-energy physics.
- Identify what RCP adds to the standard EFT universality argument.
- Examine three potential constraint sources:
  1. Composition-law consistency (half-density normalization).
  2. Self-adjoint extension structure (boundary-condition data).
  3. Dimension-specific structure (V=(1/6)R in d=4).
- Write up findings on blackboard, propose update to motivations.md.

## Acceptance tests
1. Clear statement of what RCP adds vs. what standard EFT already says.
2. At least one concrete example where the composition-law perspective
   gives a different derivation of a known constraint.
3. Honest assessment of whether the gain is conceptual or empirical.
