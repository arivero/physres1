# C170 Plan: Adiabatic limit Remark 3.5 in uncuttable

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Promote S129 blackboard (adiabatic limit as controlled refinement) as Remark 3.5 in uncuttable satellite.

## Target manuscripts (must edit ≥1)
- `paper/main.md` (no)
- `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Remark 3.5 after Remark 3.4 (symplectic integrators), before Section 4 (Outlook)
- ~3-5 lines: adiabatic theorem as refinement limit, Berry phase as geometric correction/holonomy, connection to "extra structure" theme

Out of scope:
- Full adiabatic condition formulas (keep compact)
- Landau-Zener details
- Bibliography additions (Berry 1984 not needed for a structural remark)

## Minimum promotion bar
One paragraph-level remark block connecting adiabatic limit → refinement pattern → Berry phase holonomy.

## Acceptance criteria
- Uncuttable manuscript changed (substantively).
- Diffstat recorded in `cycles/C170-execution.md`.
- Guard check passes: no cycle IDs in manuscripts.
