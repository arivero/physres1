# S101 Plan: Cross-reference action-angle + expand uncuttable satellite
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
1. Add cross-reference from cornerstone D4.2b to action-angle satellite (quick).
2. Expand the uncuttable-controlled-refinement paper with a worked "regularized derivative" example making the renormalization analogy more explicit.
