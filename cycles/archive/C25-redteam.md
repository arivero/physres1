## Failure Modes
1. The new H2.5b clarification makes the paper feel “RG-heavy” in a section meant to be dimensional/hypothesis hygiene.
2. The statement becomes circular (“H2.5b already assumes RG”).

## Mitigations
- Phrase the \(\mu\) point as a basic dimensional-analysis fact: dimensionful couplings need a reference scale to form expansion parameters.
- Keep the transmutation branch clearly outside H2.5b.
