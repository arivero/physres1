# S57 Execution: Decide Whether to Open a Dedicated String-Tension Dependent Draft

## Work
- Evaluated current branch substance:
  - OA anchor exists (`[Greensite2003Confinement]`).
  - We have a clean hypothesis-separated paragraph in `papers/planck-area/main.md` and an internal bridge note (`S56`).
  - Missing: a technical section that connects \(\sigma^{-1}\) to half-density scalarization beyond dimensional matching.

## Decision
Do **not** open a dedicated `papers/string-tension-as-area-scale/main.md` draft yet.
Keep the string-tension option as a bounded scale-supplier branch inside `papers/planck-area/main.md` until we have at least one nontrivial technical result to populate the new draft.

## Result
Recorded the decision memo in:
- `blackboards/2026-02-10-string-tension-draft-decision.md`

## Next
- Proceed with `S58` (return to \(\tau\) formalization as a regulator-independent lemma).
- Optionally later: run a deeper gauge-theory `S` cycle aimed at producing one technical, half-density-aligned statement; only then open a dedicated draft.
