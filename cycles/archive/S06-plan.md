# S06 Plan

## Goal
Tighten the half-density \(\Rightarrow\) universal area-scale ladder by studying the missing “what counts as a coupling” rule behind H2.5, and by separating:
1. representational choices (scalarization gauge),
2. selection principles (background-free, coupling-built),
3. RG/transmutation scale suppliers.

## Scope
1. Write a new blackboard note that:
   - explains why “no fractional powers” is not coordinate invariant unless formulated as perturbative analyticity,
   - proposes a concrete admissibility rule for which symbols may be treated as couplings in the sieve (vs scheme/scale conventions like \(\mu\), \(\Lambda\)),
   - checks how including \(\Lambda_d\) (cosmological constant) or \(\alpha'\) (string tension) changes the “\(d=4\)” sieve outcome without mixing filters.

## Non-Goals
- No bibliography search/ingest in this cycle.
- No manuscript edits in this cycle.

## Acceptance Tests
1. A new dated blackboard note exists in `blackboards/` and includes an explicit “admissible couplings” rule proposal.
2. The note contains ≥2 promotion candidates for `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
