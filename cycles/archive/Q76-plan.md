# Q76 Plan: Referee pass on C120 (PA-D1.4a free-propagator composition)

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle
- `C120`: inserted Derivation PA-D1.4a after PA-D1.4 in planck-area Section 4.

## Goal
Verify:
1. The semigroup computation is algebraically correct (three-way d/2 cancellation).
2. The claim "cancellation is exact only for this exponent" is justified.
3. The tangent-groupoid connection is consistent with PA-D1.2a.
4. No internal references or cycle tags.
5. PA-label namespace consistent.

## Checklist
- Free-propagator formula matches standard conventions.
- Gaussian integral result correct.
- Prefactor algebra verified.
- "Only for d/2" claim checked.
- Tangent-groupoid rescaling ε = ℏt/m consistent with PA-D1.2a.
