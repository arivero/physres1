# Q16 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b SR Promotion

## Goal
Referee-style check of the new `Remark D1.5b` in `papers/planck-area/main.md`:
- claim scope and caveats,
- notation consistency with D1.5/D1.5a,
- algebraic and limit sanity.

## Checks
1. Read-through of D1.5, D1.5a, D1.5b as one narrative block.
2. Algebra sanity check of the interpolation limits.
3. Policy check: ensure no cycle-label leakage in `paper/main.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- D1.5b is framed as model-level continuation, not universal theorem.
- Compton-branch and \(2L_P\) floor limits are consistent.
- No edits required, or fixes are applied and logged.
