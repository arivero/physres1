# Q159 Redteam

One minor scope issue: the index theorem claim ("index of a Dirac-type operator equals ∫_M a_{D/2} d^D x (up to normalization) via the McKean-Singer supertrace formula") collapses several steps. McKean-Singer applies to operators with a Z_2 grading (fermionic heat kernel supertrace), not directly to the scalar heat kernel of Remark HD-D4.2. However, the remark does say "Dirac-type operator," signaling the reader that a different operator class is involved. The phrasing is compact but not incorrect. No blocking issues.
