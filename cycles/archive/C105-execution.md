# C105 Execution: Promote symplectic-Euler remark + Berkeley citation

Date: 2026-02-12

## Summary
- What changed in manuscripts (high level):
  - Section 1: added Berkeley's "ghosts of departed quantities" as historical precursor to the refinement-paradox framing, with citation [Berkeley1734Analyst].
  - Section 3.3: added Heuristic H1.2 identifying the kick-drift scheme as symplectic Euler, explaining exact L-conservation from symplecticity, and noting the constrained-corrections analogy with gauge-invariant counterterms.

## Work log
1. Edited Section 1 (line 16): inserted one clause citing [Berkeley1734Analyst] in the Zeno-style paradox sentence.
2. Edited Section 3.3: added Heuristic H1.2 after Remark H1.1a, before Section 3.4.
