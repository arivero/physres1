# S208 — Debate

## Hard question
Is the Padé [0/1] recovery of the Yukawa pole really "non-perturbative,"
or is it just inverting a known formula?

## Resolution
The Padé recovery is genuinely non-trivial for three reasons:

1. **It works from IR data alone.** Given only C₀ and C₂ (measurable
   at low energy), the Padé extrapolation determines M (a UV scale).
   This is the essence of the EFT matching problem: low-energy
   Wilson coefficients encode high-energy physics.

2. **It extends beyond the radius of convergence.** The Taylor series
   of 1/(1+x) converges only for |x| < 1, i.e., |q²| < M². The Padé
   [0/1] converges everywhere except at the pole q² = -M². This is
   controlled extrapolation, not just rearranging a known answer.

3. **It generalizes.** For multi-mediator exchange (several poles), the
   contact expansion has more coefficients, and higher Padé approximants
   [L/M] with M > 1 recover multiple poles. For cuts, diagonal Padé
   [N/N] accumulate poles on the cut. The method is systematic.

The example is "simple" in the sense that the answer is known. But
that's the point: it provides a concrete, verifiable worked example of
non-perturbative recovery, which is what question #4 asked for.
