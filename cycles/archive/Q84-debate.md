# Q84 Debate

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is 139 lines / 5 pages / 4 references really enough for Tier 1?

## Resolution
Yes. Same reasoning as Q81 (half-density-qft at 210 lines / 7 pages / 5 refs): the paper is intentionally narrow, makes explicit computations, and the references anchor the key frameworks. Length is proportional to content.
