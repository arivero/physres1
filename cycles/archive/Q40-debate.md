# Q40 Debate: Should H0.3 Be Moved to Section 9?

## Question
Would the "why \(\hbar,c,G\)" heuristic be better placed in Section 9 (interpretation), to keep the Introduction purely structural?

## Current Resolution
Keep it in the Introduction for now because the user-priority is foundations framing and it stays to one paragraph. Revisit if reviewer-style feedback flags intro density.
