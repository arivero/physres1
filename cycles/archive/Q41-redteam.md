# Q41 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Branch mixing**: readers conflate \(\alpha_\ast\) (fundamental UV) with \(\sigma^{-1}\) (emergent IR).
2. **Implied universality**: readers think the paper assumes confinement or QCD-like dynamics universally.
3. **Citations insufficient**: the operational definition needs multiple sources.

## Mitigations
1. Keep `Remark E4a` explicit about the logical branch placement.
2. Keep conditional language ("when it exists") and avoid claims about Nature.
3. Add a second OA reference later only if reviewers demand; avoid bibliography bloat prematurely.
