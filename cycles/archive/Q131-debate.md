# Q131 — Debate

## Hard question
Is the Q131 reviewer right that the 1/6 ratio is "physically invalid"
because SR and GR are incompatible frameworks?

## Resolution
The reviewer overstates the objection. The paper's thesis is about
*refinement witnesses*: SR is a partial refinement of Newtonian mechanics
that captures a definite fraction (1/6) of the full GR effect. This
is not a claim that GR = SR + corrections; it is a claim that
SR captures the 1PN kinematic term. The C245 debate already resolved
this: the 1/6 ratio has clear meaning in the post-Newtonian expansion.

However, Remark 3.2 itself should be clearer about this. Adding
"in the post-Newtonian expansion" or "the kinematic contribution"
would address the legitimate concern without surrendering the insight.

The citation fix is straightforward and correct — BDF is cited for
the physics but does not contain the Binet-form equation.
