## Hard question
Does a numerical example belong in a structural/theoretical paper?

**Decision**: Yes. The subagent reviewer (skeptical mathematician persona) specifically endorsed it. The example is concrete, falsifiable, and clarifies the distinction between exact invariants (L, area) and approximate quantities (trajectory, energy) under the polygonal scheme.
