# Q44 Execution: Referee Pass on the New \(c\to\infty\) Subtraction Witness (`Derivation D0.2`)

## Checks Run
- Reviewed `paper/main.md` Section 2.4 around `Derivation D0.2` for:
  - whether the "constant shift is inert" statement is properly scoped,
  - whether the block reads as limit-control (not pedagogy),
  - whether the pointer from `Heuristic H0.3` is unobtrusive.

## Findings
- The block benefits from one explicit sentence scoping the "constant shift is inert" remark to particle mechanics.

## Edits Made
- Added a short scope disclaimer to `paper/main.md` `Derivation D0.2` (field-theory/gravity vacuum-energy issues are separate).

## Next Spawn
- `C86` (optional): add a similarly concrete \(G\) witness tied to the half-density area-scale ladder (promote from `papers/planck-area/main.md` when ready).
