## Findings
Semiclassical analysis specialist reviewed blackboard 1. All claims CORRECT (two with caveats):
- WKB ansatz and Hamilton-Jacobi: correct (minor: A also expands in ℏ)
- Connection formulas: correct (Airy matching is standard)
- Bohr-Sommerfeld: correct (½ from Maslov index μ=2 for 2 turning points)
- Asymptotic divergence: correct (factorial growth, Gevrey-1)
- Maslov/Berry parallel: correct (topological vs geometric, unified by holonomy)

The promoted remark correctly captures the key structural points. Used the
general Maslov form ∮ p dq = (n + ½μ)ℏ rather than the specific (n+½)πℏ
to be more general.
