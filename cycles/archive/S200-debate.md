# S200 — Debate

## Key decisions
1. Born approximation is the right bridge because it directly equates the
   propagator with the momentum-space potential — making the connection
   between Sections 2 and 4 transparent.
2. No new reference needed: Sakurai and Griffiths cover this at textbook level.
3. The "beyond Born" connection to the T-matrix (Examples 5.1–5.2) is important
   to include because it shows the contact limit is not just a Born artifact.
