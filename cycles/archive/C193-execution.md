# C193 Execution: Promote number-phase remark

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Inserted Remark 2.1 after the [L_z, E] = ℏE paragraph, before Section 3.
2. Content: Susskind-Glogower E₋ = â(N+1)^{-1/2} as oscillator analog of e^{iφ}, vacuum obstruction E₊E₋ = I - |0⟩⟨0|, Fock states have uniform phase, localizing phase requires coherent-state superposition.
3. Built PDF: 10 pages, 161 lines (+3).
