## Potential weaknesses
1. Example 5.2b repeats some content from Remark 5.2a (same three regimes). Mitigation: the Example adds concrete numbers (q=5/2 threshold), the Remark is abstract classification.
2. Remark 4.3b mixes G=c=1 units (Section 4 convention) with the K,c notation of Section 3. The SR reference uses "K/c" while GR uses "M". Acceptable since it cross-references Section 3.1 explicitly.
3. "No stable circular orbit exists, regardless of radius" — strictly, unstable circular orbits DO exist for 3M < r < 6M. The claim is about stable ones. Wording is correct.
