# C124 Plan: Promote S85 Wilsonian shell derivation into rg-fundamental

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Insert the Wilsonian shell-integration beta function from S85 into `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` as `Derivation RG-D1.2a`, placed at the end of Section 5.2 (before 5.3).

## Promotion source
- `blackboards/2026-02-13-wilsonian-shell-2d-delta.md` (Sections 2–5)

## Target location
- After the integrated flow equation at the end of Section 5.2
- Before `## 5.3 Dimensional Transmutation via the Bound State`

## Content to promote
- Shell integral computation (exact at threshold)
- Effective coupling matching
- Semigroup composition identity
- Connection to Section 6 (Schur complement)

## Labeling
- `Derivation RG-D1.2a` (Wilsonian shell integration: explicit semigroup composition)

## Guard checks needed
- No cycle tags in manuscript
- No transcript references
- Rebuild PDF

## Diffstat required
Yes (C cycle editing a manuscript).
