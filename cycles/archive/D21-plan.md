# D21 Plan: Parallel D-track A — Manuscript integration strategy for threshold thread

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Decide long-term placement strategy: keep threshold details in main-paper remark vs move weight to companion references.

## Triage questions
1. What belongs in `paper/main.md` vs note layer?
2. Which details should remain permanently companion-only?

## Acceptance criteria
- One explicit integration policy statement.
- One promotion checklist for future C-cycle use.

## Iteration extension (append-only)
- Add a quantitative readability trigger so C-cycle launch is not purely taste-driven.

## Policy addendum (session rule)
- D21 follow-ups must not use `paper/notes/`; strategy notes go to blackboard/notebook layers.

## Iteration 3 extension (append-only)
- Add tie-break policy when multiple candidates pass the readability gate: maximize caveat coverage first, then compression.

## Iteration 4 extension (append-only)
- Add integrated readiness matrix across S275/S276/S277/S278 + D22 outputs, and make launch/defer decision explicit.

## Iteration 6 scope correction (append-only)
- Absorb manuscript-notation harmonization as a `D21` launch-prep responsibility (not `S`).

## Iteration 7 boundary correction (append-only; supersedes iteration 6 wording)
- `D21` does not own notation harmonization or sentence-polish tasks.
- Such work belongs to `C` cycles (e.g., `C300`) unless the task is explicitly TeX-mechanics discovery.

## Scope re-anchor (2026-02-14, append-only)
- D21 is closed as discovery-inactive: prior launch-policy/editing-gate work is administrative, not discovery.
- Any remaining wording or notation decisions are deferred to `C300` (if opened).

## Closure addendum (2026-02-14)
- D21 closed as discovery-inactive administrative trace.
