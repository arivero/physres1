# C73 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Scope confusion:** readers think this is a claim about atomic discreteness rather than limit control.
2. **History leakage:** accidental historical assertions without sources.
3. **Redundancy:** note repeats `paper/main.md` without adding a clean definition/toy.

## Mitigations
1. Define "uncuttable" explicitly as controlled refinement (not indivisibility).
2. Keep the note historically neutral.
3. Include one concrete toy refinement example (Riemann sums) and one explicit bridge to H0.2.
