# Q55 Red Team: What a referee would attack (C98)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Likely referee objections
- “This belongs in a numerical analysis appendix, not an RG note”:
  - Mitigation: keep it to one subsection and explicitly label it as an analogy witness supporting the composed-refinement thesis.
- Notation ambiguity in \(f'(f)\):
  - Mitigation: tighten to \(f'(y)f(y)\) in a later micro `C` bundle, or restate the evaluation point once more.
