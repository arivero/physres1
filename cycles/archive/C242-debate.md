# C242 — Debate

## Condensation choices
The blackboard note (135 lines with annotations) was condensed to ~15 lines
of manuscript prose. Key omissions:
- Functional determinant formula (ζ-function regularization) — too technical
  for a remark; would need its own derivation.
- Explicit a_2 structure — mentioned in passing but not written out.
- Additional references from reviewer (Gilkey, BGV, Synge, Christensen) —
  kept only the two most essential (DeWitt, Vassilevich).

## Placement rationale
After HD-D4.1 (doubling) and before Section 5 (counterterms): the heat
kernel remark bridges the propagator (Section 4) and the counterterm
(Section 5) discussions, showing that the UV structure of the propagator
naturally produces the curvature counterterms.
