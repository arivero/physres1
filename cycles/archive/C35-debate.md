# C35 Debate

## Question
Should the “weak Euler–Lagrange / corners” material live in the delta-objects synthesis draft, or should it be split into a dedicated follow-up note?

## Working Resolution
Add only a minimal bridge paragraph here (to resolve the delta-vs-delta′ confusion and to explain “delta for extremals” in weak form).
If it grows beyond a few lines, spin it into the dedicated “corners/impulses” thread (see `docs/research-state.md`, thread 5).
