# Q50 Plan: Referee Pass on Editorial Cleanup (C93)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C93`: removed “continuation” editorial language in Appendix 10; added `[TongQMLectures]` anchor in `Remark D4.2b`

## Goal
Referee-pass `C93` for reader flow and minimality: ensure the editorial cleanup reads naturally and the added citation does not introduce new claims or notation issues.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q50-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`
- `docs/`, `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`

## Checklist
- Headings/intro sentences in Section 10 read as standalone prose.
- Added citation is placed naturally and does not interrupt the argument.
- No new meta-language introduced.

## Acceptance criteria
- Actionable follow-ups (if any) expressed as spawned cycles.
