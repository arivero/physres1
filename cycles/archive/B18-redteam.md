## Failure modes

### 1. Under-citing the conformal conjugation result
- Risk: HD-D1.3 (conformal expansion with D(4-D)/4) is a concrete computation that could benefit from a differential geometry citation.
- Mitigation: the computation is self-contained and verified by SymPy (noted in the text). The D(4-D)/4 coefficient is classical; Wald provides the conformal coupling context. A more specialized reference (Branson, Parker-Toms) could be added later but isn't load-bearing.

### 2. Too few non-OA references may limit credibility
- Risk: 3 of 5 references are not OA.
- Mitigation: OA-first policy is satisfied (BatesWeinstein1997 and deGosson2018 are OA). The non-OA references are universally known standard texts (Wald, Hörmander, Costello). They anchor claims rather than provide unique content.
