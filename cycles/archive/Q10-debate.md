# Q10 Debate: Lie Derivatives in a QFT Draft—Too Abstract?

## Hard Question
Does using Lie derivatives to express \(\partial_x\delta(x-y)=-\partial_y\delta(x-y)\) risk alienating QFT readers who expect coordinate formulas?

## Current Resolution
Keep Lie derivatives as a single boxed identity presented explicitly as the coordinate-free form of the familiar coordinate statement, and keep all formal details in the S18 blackboard note.
