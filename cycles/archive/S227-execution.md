# S227 — Execution: Jacobi sufficiency for free particle

## Outcome
Verified:
- Strong Legendre: ∂²L/∂ẋ² = m > 0 for L = m/2 ẋ²
- Jacobi equation: ẍ_J = 0, solutions q_J = At+B
- No conjugate points on (0,T): with q_J(0)=0, only q_J=At, vanishes
  at interior t* only if A=0 (trivial)
- Sufficiency: straight line is strict weak local minimum
- Action excess S-S₀>0 is the quantitative manifestation

Drafted Remark 4.3b for promotion.
