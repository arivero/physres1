# Q130 — Execution

## Referee findings (skeptical theoretical physicist)

### MINOR
1. **ω vs σ notation**: The relationship between ω = (1/4)ln|g|
   (general) and σ (conformal factor in HD-D1.3) should be clarified
   for readers connecting the two computations.
   **Fixed:** Added parenthetical "(In the conformally flat setting of
   Derivation HD-D1.3, ω=(D/4)σ; the present computation holds for
   arbitrary Riemannian metrics.)"

### CORRECT (no action needed)
2. Normal-coordinate expansion |g| = 1 − (1/3)R_μν x^μ x^ν: correct.
3. Steps 1–6 of the derivation: all correct.
4. ξ_conf = 1/6 iff D=4: correct.
5. Seeley-DeWitt connection a₁ = (1/6 − ξ)R: correct and properly cited.
6. Transition from HD-D1.3a: logically smooth.
7. Significance: appropriately balanced (no overclaiming).

## Verdict
CONDITIONAL PASS → PASS after fix #1 applied.
