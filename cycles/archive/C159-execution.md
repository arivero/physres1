# C159 Execution
Date: 2026-02-13

## Content Added
Example 4.3 (Verifying the bound for the Dirichlet-kernel packet) added to action-angle satellite after Proposition 4.2.

Shows for ψ_M:
1. R = 2M/(2M+1) via orthogonality
2. Var(L_z) = ℏ²M(M+1)/3
3. LHS/RHS = (M+1)(4M+1)/(3M) — 10/3 at M=1, grows as 4M/3
4. Far from tight; narrower packets require disproportionately more angular-momentum spread

## Also in this cycle
Q107 fix: added √κ normalization to half-density expression in delta-objects Example 4.1.
