# S94 Plan: Delta-objects paper expansion with Van Vleck connection
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
The delta-objects Outlook (Section 6, item 1) identifies an unexplored connection: the determinant weights in δ(∇f) should relate to Van Vleck determinants in time slicing. Add a new Section 3.5 making this explicit.

## Key insight
The Van Vleck determinant |det(-∂²S_cl/∂q_f∂q_i)|^{1/2} in the short-time propagator is a stationary-phase instance of Section 3.3's square-root Hessian pattern. For the free particle, it reduces to (m/Δt)^{d/2} — the same t^{-d/2} normalization as in Section 2.
