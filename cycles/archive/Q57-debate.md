# Q57 Debate: referee pass on C100 step-halving/rooted-tree polish

Date: 2026-02-11

## Hard question
Does the \(F([\bullet])\) notation pull its weight in the main paper, or does it add an undefined symbol that hurts readability?

## Current resolution
Keep the rooted-tree names but add a one-line first-use definition (or drop the \(F\) notation) so the branch-tree remark is self-contained; queued as `C102`.
