# Q18 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Thread bloat:** too many sub-remarks reduce readability.
2. **Implicit assumptions:** central-source structure behind \(U^\mu\) projection not noticed.
3. **Premature closure:** readers think clock ambiguity is fully resolved in all theories.

## Mitigations
1. Keep D1.5d as one compact paragraph-level remark.
2. Mention source-4-velocity dependence explicitly (already done).
3. Queue further study (`S30`) on frame-free area-2-form options before stronger claims.
