# Q142 — Debate

## Should the MEDIUM citation issue trigger a fix?
No. The transport equation ∇_μ(Δ^{1/2} ∇^μ s) = D Δ^{1/2} is standard DeWitt-Schwinger
formalism. [DeWitt1965] is already in the bibliography. The referee's concern was
about source accessibility, not mathematical correctness. Adding a second reference
would be nice but is not necessary for correctness.
