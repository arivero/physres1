The connection is non-obvious: precession (orbit shape) and stability
(radial response) appear in different sections and concern different
physical phenomena. The identity γ²ω²=1 bridges them through a single
dimensionless invariant. The paper currently treats both results
independently; the remark adds a unifying perspective.
