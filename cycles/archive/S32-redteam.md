# S32 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Hidden assumptions:** central/planar conditions not stated.
2. **Overclaim:** treating kinematic identity as dynamical law.
3. **Notation confusion:** mixing vector \(\mathbf L\) and scalar \(\ell\).

## Mitigations
1. Keep planarity and tangential-speed decomposition explicit.
2. Label results as force-independent kinematics.
3. Use \(\ell\) consistently for specific angular momentum scalar.
