# Q54 Debate: Is the Gaussian “\(\varepsilon^{-D/2}\)” witness too specific?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Does using an explicit Gaussian approximate identity risk implying more structure (positivity, heat-kernel semantics) than intended for a general kernel calculus note?

## Recommendation
No: it is clearly presented as a *normalization witness* for the delta kernel scaling exponent in local coordinates. Keep it as-is, with optional future one-sentence “local patch” clarification if needed.
