# D21 Redteam

Date: 2026-02-14

## Risks
1. Over-compressing core claims into opaque shorthand.
2. Over-expanding Section 3 and harming flow.

## Mitigations
1. Define explicit max-length guidance for bridge remarks.
2. Keep deeper derivations in notes/companions by default.

## Iteration 2 addendum
3. Use a measurable compression threshold plus caveat checklist before launching readability-only C-cycles.

## Iteration 3 addendum
4. Risk: selecting the shortest passing candidate may still drop useful explicit scope words.
5. Mitigation: tie-break by caveat coverage first, then compactness.

## Iteration 4 addendum
6. Risk: repeated deferral despite readiness can create stale decision loops.
7. Mitigation: tie launch explicitly to a binary readability-priority flag.

## Iteration 6 addendum
8. Risk: boundary drift between technical study and editorial preparation.
9. Mitigation: explicit ownership split (`S` technical checks; `D/C` manuscript-prep checks).

## Iteration 7 addendum
10. Risk: using `D` to pre-edit manuscript wording can bypass the `C` boundary.
11. Mitigation: keep `D` to decision/triage logic; move all wording harmonization into the `C` promotion cycle.

## Re-anchor addendum
12. Risk: discovery labels can be diluted by process/policy work.
13. Mitigation: hard-stop D-cycle continuation when novelty/hypothesis content is absent.

## Closure addendum
14. Mitigation applied: D21 closed to enforce discovery-only semantics.
