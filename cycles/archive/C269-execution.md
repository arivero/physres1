# C269 — Execution

Inserted Remark 4.4a after Newton's polygonal argument paragraph (line 164),
before Section 4.5. Three lines covering:
1. Noether charge Q = (∂L/∂q̇)·ξ conserved on smooth segments
2. Impulse jump ΔQ = J·ξ(q(t₀)) from Theorem 3.2 + continuity of q
3. Conservation criterion J·ξ = 0; Section 4.4 as special case (ξ=rθ̂, J=J_r r̂)
