# C86 Debate: Does Mentioning Planck Area Overcommit the Main Paper?

## Question
Does introducing \(\ell_P^2=\hbar G/c^3\) in the main paper implicitly commit to a gravity program?

## Current Resolution
No, if it is framed as a dimensional "natural candidate" for a universal area scale in a scalarization gauge, and the main paper remains agnostic about whether that scale is fundamental or emergent (dependent drafts explore hypotheses).
