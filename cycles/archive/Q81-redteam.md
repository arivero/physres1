## Failure modes

### 1. Missing the Unicode bug
- Risk: the \u03b4 escape could propagate to PDF output.
- Mitigation: caught in this Q pass. One-line fix in C127.

### 2. Over-promoting to Tier 1
- Risk: the paper might need more than 5 references for a publication-quality bibliography.
- Mitigation: the 5 references are well-chosen (2 OA, all standard). More can be added in a future B cycle if a reviewer requests additional context. The Tier 1 designation means "content complete, needs P cycle only" — not "no further improvements possible."
