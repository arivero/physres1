# C227 Debate: Promote Dipole Selection Rules Remark

## Scope & Fit
Remark 3.2 follows naturally after Remark 3.1 (azimuthal Fourier structure). Selection rules are the physical consequence of orthogonality; placing them here strengthens the Fourier theme without overreach.

## Physics Alignment
Selection rules (Δm, Δl) connect to:
- **Section 3:** Local azimuthal structure (Δm via integral orthogonality)
- **Section 4:** Global action-angle momentum exchange (photon carries angular momentum)
- **Zeeman:** Concrete example showing selection rule observability

## Pedagogy
Remark is self-contained but references Clebsch-Gordan and dipole operator structure (standard background). Length is appropriate for a remark.

## Consensus
Promotion is well-justified and maintains manuscript coherence.
