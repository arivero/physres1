## Failure mode 1: Premature closure
Declaring question 3 "partially addressed" might prevent future
exploration of the more interesting Levels 2–3.

**Mitigation**: The motivations.md update explicitly lists the two
open avenues. The status is "partially addressed," not "closed."

## Failure mode 2: Level 1 is obvious
A referee might say "of course path-integral composition, RG, and
contact data are all consistency conditions — this is textbook."

**Mitigation**: The claim is not that each is separately a consistency
condition, but that RCP provides a *single principle* from which
all three follow. The unification is non-trivial because standard
treatments derive them from different axioms (Dirac postulate,
Wilson's OPE, Appelquist–Carazzone theorem).

## Failure mode 3: Level 3 overreach
Claiming "positivity from composition" without a calculation is
hand-waving.

**Mitigation**: Correctly flagged as "speculative, unworked." No
claim of a result, only identification of a research direction.
