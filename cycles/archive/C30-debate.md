# C30 Debate

## Question
Should we add the “\(\delta(f')=\sum \delta_{x_i}/|f''(x_i)|\)” identity directly in the main paper, or keep it in a blackboard note?

## Working Resolution
Add it in the main paper as a brief finite-dimensional sanity check right after `Derivation D3.5`, since the manuscript already invokes \(\delta(\nabla f)\) and “square-root delta” normalization. Keep it explicitly scoped to the nondegenerate case.
