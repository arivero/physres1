# S25 Debate: How Much GR Belongs in This Project?

## Question
GR can quickly dominate the narrative; we only need a baseline for the “relativistic central orbits” branch.

## Resolution
Keep this cycle minimal and computational:
derive the effective potential and photon sphere cleanly, record ISCO as an optional line, and stop. Any deeper GR (Kerr, lensing, QNMs) is out of scope for now.
