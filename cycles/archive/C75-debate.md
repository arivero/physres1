# C75 Debate: σ-Finite vs "Finite on a Neighborhood" Wording

## Question
Which hypothesis should the manuscript state: "\(\sigma\)-finite" or "finite on a neighborhood"?

## Current Resolution
Use "\(\sigma\)-finite" in the manuscript because it is a standard hypothesis for excluding pathological translation-invariant measures in non-locally-compact settings and matches the chosen reference.
