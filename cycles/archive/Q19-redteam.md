# Q19 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Cognitive load:** too many adjacent remarks reduce accessibility.
2. **Reader confusion:** branch assumptions (\(dA/dt\), \(dA/d\tau\), \(\ell\)-fixed) conflated.
3. **Overguarding:** caveats dominate and obscure the main witness.

## Mitigations
1. Keep each remark one short block with explicit trigger assumption.
2. Keep branch equations visible and parallel.
3. Consider a later structural edit (if needed) after another study cycle.
