# C107 Red Team: H4.0c promotion failure modes

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes
- Overstating the connection between half-density and RG filters:
  - Mitigation: H4.0c explicitly says "logically independent" and "nontrivial structural check" rather than claiming a derivation.
- Reader confusion about form-degree notation:
  - Mitigation: the p-form reference is parenthetical and self-contained; the main point (D=4 marginality) is stated first in plain terms.
- Missing citation for YM conformal invariance:
  - Mitigation: this is standard textbook material (conformal weight of F wedge *F). No specific citation needed for dimensional analysis statements.
