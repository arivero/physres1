## r_ISCO/r_ph = 2 verification
- r_ph = 3M (from Section 4.1, null geodesic V'=0)
- r_ISCO = 6M (from Section 4.3, timelike V''=0)
- Ratio: 6M/3M = 2 ✓
- L-independent: r_ph depends only on M (it's the null orbit). r_ISCO
  is the boundary where L² = Mr²/(r-3M) and V''=0 simultaneously,
  giving r=6M independent of the specific L value. ✓

## "No unstable band in SR" — correct?
Yes. In the SR model, the effective potential W_L(r) for q=2 has a single
minimum for any L > K/c, and W_L → +∞ as r→0⁺ (centrifugal barrier).
There is no second extremum creating an unstable band. ✓
