# S77 Plan: 2D delta as PA-H2.13 transmutation instance

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Cross-thread verification: does the main paper's 2D delta computation (Section 10.5) realize the Planck-area draft's PA-H2.13 transmutation branch? Connects Thread 1 (main paper RG), Thread 2 (Planck-area), and S76 (linear/nonlinear beta criterion).

## Deliverable (keep bounded)
- Target: 1-page cross-check matching Section 10.5 data against PA-H2.13 framework, plus dimension-sieve assessment.
- Output file: `blackboards/2026-02-12-2d-delta-as-transmutation-instance.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `docs/research-log.md`, `cycles/S77-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts, bibliography, sources

## Acceptance criteria
- Self-contained cross-check with concrete table. Discovery flag filled in.
