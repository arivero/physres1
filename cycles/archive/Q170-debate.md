# Q170 — Debate

## Advocate (for PASS)

1. **Mathematics verified end-to-end.** The derivation chain W_L'' → ω_r² →
   ratio is algebraically clean: every factor (L², γ, m, r_0) cancels
   correctly in the ratio. The formula 3−q−β² is confirmed.

2. **All specializations checked.** q=2 → 1/γ² = ω² (Binet); v→0 → 3−q
   (Newtonian); γ²ω² = 1 (Remark 5.2c) all recovered as special cases.

3. **The effective mass γm (not γ³m) is correct.** The Hamiltonian expansion
   at p_r = 0 gives ∂²H/∂p_r² = 1/(γm). The γ³m "longitudinal mass" would
   apply to parallel-to-velocity perturbations; here the radial perturbation
   is perpendicular to the circular velocity, so γm is the correct inertia.
   This is the one subtlety in the derivation and it is handled correctly.

4. **Content is genuinely new and not redundant.** The general-q formula was
   not stated anywhere in the paper. It subsumes Remark 5.2c while adding
   the universal −β² correction for all q — a clean physical insight.

5. **Guardrails clean.** No cycle tags, no transcript citations.

## Skeptic (for PASS WITH FIXES or FAIL)

1. **Phrasing nitpick.** "Hamiltonian expansion of Section 5.1" is slightly
   imprecise — the expansion uses both Sections 5 (Hamiltonian definition),
   5.1 (W_L definition), and 5.2 (W_L'' computation). But the imprecision
   is harmless.

2. **"Radial oscillation frequency" vs "frequency ratio."** The sentence
   "gives the radial oscillation frequency ω_r²/ω_φ²" conflates frequency
   with ratio. A pedantic reader might object. But in context the expression
   immediately clarifies itself.

3. **No derivation shown.** The remark states the result without derivation.
   A referee might want a one-line hint (e.g., "from ω_r² = W_L''/(γm) and
   ω_φ = L/(γmr_0²)"). But the paper's style for remarks is assertion-with-
   citation-to-section, not derivation, so this is consistent.

## Resolution

The skeptic's points are all LOW: phrasing preferences, not errors. The
mathematics is correct, the content is new, and guardrails are clean.

**Verdict: PASS.** No changes required. The two LOW optionals (Section
reference precision, frequency-vs-ratio phrasing) are noted but do not
warrant a PASS WITH FIXES.
