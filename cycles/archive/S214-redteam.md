# S214 Red-Team: Why D=10,11,26 Are Absent

## Verdict: PASS (study cycle, no manuscript changes)

The analysis correctly identifies the "two layers" structure and the parity
obstruction. Key checks:

1. **Is the parity argument correct?** Yes — for gravity-only sieve,
   k = d/(2(d-2)). For d=10: 5/8, d=26: 13/24, d=11: 11/18. None integers.
   With additional couplings, the linear Diophantine equation has parity
   constraints that block d=10,11,26.

2. **Is the "two layers" framing accurate?** Yes — well-established in the
   literature. Half-densities are about measure/kernel theory; string dimensions
   are about field content + anomaly cancellation.

3. **Does PA-H2.6 already cover this?** Yes, but at a less specific level.
   The parity obstruction adds a precise mechanism.

4. **Any risk of overclaiming?** No — the blackboard explicitly says "not a gap
   but a feature" and "outside scope."

No corrections needed.
