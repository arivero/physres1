# S211 — Debate

## Hard question
Is there a smaller step toward formalization that IS within paper scope?

## Resolution
The independence sketches (§4 of the blackboard) could become a structured
remark in §10.3: "P10.1's conditions are logically independent; here are
minimal counterexamples for each proper subset." This would strengthen
P10.1 without requiring the full derivation program.

However: the cornerstone is at 23pp (Physics Reports scale) and §10.3 is
already tight. Adding independence counterexamples would be a natural
expansion only if the paper goes through a revision cycle.

## Hard question 2
Is the hierarchy (C → CM, C+Q → QM, C+Q+R → QFT) a new observation
or standard folklore?

## Resolution
The hierarchy is implicit in the paper's structure (sections 3-4 → 5-7 → 8)
but has NOT been stated as an explicit "axiom hierarchy" anywhere. Stating
it explicitly, with counterexamples, would be a modest contribution. But
again: only worthwhile in a revision of the cornerstone, not as a satellite
remark.
