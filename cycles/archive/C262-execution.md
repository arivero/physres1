# C262 — Execution: Promote S227 into dirac-probes

## Changes
Remark 4.3b (Strict minimality of the free path — Jacobi sufficiency)
inserted after Remark 4.3a, before Section 4.4.

Content: strong Legendre condition m>0, Jacobi equation ẍ_J=0, no conjugate
points, sufficiency → straight line is strict weak local minimum. Action
excess S-S₀>0 is the manifestation.

## Result
- Paper: 222 → 225 lines (+3), 5pp (still well within PLB limit).

## Diffstat
(to be filled at commit time)
