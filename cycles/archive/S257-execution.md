# S257 — Execution
Compiled 6 explicit c→∞ limits from the paper. They partition into
three classes: (1) kinematic corrections that vanish (γ-factors,
radius contraction); (2) admissibility constraints that become trivial
(L>K/c→L>0); (3) geometric relations recovered exactly (r=L²/(Km),
binding energy). This three-class partition makes explicit the
"refinement-witness" character: SR adds constraints/effects that
vanish in the limit while preserving core geometry.
PROMOTED as C283 (Remark 3.1a).
