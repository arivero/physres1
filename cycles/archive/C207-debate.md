# C207 Debate: Depth of applications list in Remark 2.7

Date: 2026-02-13

## Question
How many applications of ζ(−1) to list (Casimir, bosonic string, heat kernel)?

## Decision
Keep to two: Casimir effect and bosonic string critical dimension. Heat kernel detail deferred to a future remark if needed.

## Rationale
The remark should motivate, not survey; two concrete examples suffice for a 3-line addition.
