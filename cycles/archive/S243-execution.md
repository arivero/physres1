# S243 — Execution
Found uncuttable paper already has Remark 3.3 (Trotter as refinement theorem)
with full statement, O(1/N) convergence, Suzuki-Trotter symmetric splitting.
Also Remark 3.9 (Feynman-Kac via Trotter). The remark for dirac-probes
should cross-reference rather than duplicate: configuration-space face of
the abstract formula, with the uncuttable note developing it systematically.
Drafted Remark 4.5c for promotion in C278.
