# C212 — Execution

## What was done
Promoted S171 dualities blackboard as **Remark 4.8** in the uncuttable
paper, placed immediately after Remark 4.7.

### Content of Remark 4.8
The remark frames Kramers–Wannier, T-duality, and Montonen–Olive as
instances of "multiple descriptions of the same limit object," with
dualities providing distinct refinement paths that converge to the
same physical content.

### Reviewer corrections incorporated
- Full $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality group, not just $g \leftrightarrow 1/g$.
- $\mathcal{N}=4$ S-duality stated as *conjectured* to be exact.
- KW self-dual point presented as a special feature, not generic.
- No UV/IR = asymptotic safety claim (dropped entirely).
