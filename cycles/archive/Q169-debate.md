# Q169 -- Debate

## Is the Sommerfeld identification mathematically rigorous?

Yes. The chain alpha = e^2/(4 pi eps_0 hbar c) => K = Z alpha hbar c =>
K^2/(c^2 L^2) = Z^2 alpha^2/k^2 is exact algebra with no approximations.
The Sommerfeld energy formula is reproduced in the omega notation without
error. The Dirac reinterpretation is flagged rather than derived, which is
appropriate for a remark.

## Does Remark 3.2b create scope creep?

Marginally. The paper is about classical SR orbits, not quantum mechanics.
However, the remark is framed as a historical-mathematical observation
("is precisely the quantity Sommerfeld used"), not as a quantum derivation.
The paper already extends from SR into GR (Section 4), so a one-remark
connection to semiclassical quantum mechanics is stylistically consistent.
The 3-sentence length is proportionate.

## Is Outlook item 3 redundant with Remark 3.2b?

No. Remark 3.2b establishes the mathematical identification (omega is
Sommerfeld's quantity). Outlook item 3 asks the forward research question
(which bounds survive quantization?). They serve observation vs. agenda
roles respectively.

## Are the references appropriate?

Sommerfeld 1916 is essential -- a referee would flag its absence given
the explicit Sommerfeld claim. Bertrand 1873 fills a gap (Remark 3.2a
previously stated Bertrand's theorem without citing Bertrand). Both are
foundational primary sources. The reference list growing from 2 to 4 is
proportionate for a paper that now touches two historical results.

## Any subtle errors?

One point worth noting: the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition for
the angular momentum is L = k hbar (where k is a positive integer). In
the old quantum theory, this was the azimuthal quantum number (k = 1, 2,
..., n). The remark correctly uses this without specifying the range of k,
which is fine since it is identifying the formula rather than deriving the
full hydrogen spectrum.

The statement "reproduce the exact Dirac spectrum" is correct in the
technical sense (eigenvalues of the Dirac Hamiltonian for hydrogen),
though one might object that calling it "exact" could be confused with
QED-exact. In context, "exact" clearly means "closed-form eigenvalues of
the Dirac equation," which is the standard physics usage.

## Verdict

PASS. Changes are clean, correct, and well-proportioned.
