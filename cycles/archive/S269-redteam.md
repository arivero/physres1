## Failure modes
1. Treating \(\nu\) as globally defined when only asymptotic degree is used.
2. Readers infer this explains all q=2 special roles.

## Mitigations
1. State "high-momentum asymptotic degree" explicitly.
2. Add one sentence in promoted remark: dimensional identity mechanism is independent.
