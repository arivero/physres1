# S237 — Execution

Derived energy jump for the free particle:
1. H = m/2 q̇² (kinetic energy for L = m/2 q̇²)
2. ΔH = m(v₊² - v₋²)/2 = m(v₊-v₋)(v₊+v₋)/2 = J(v₊+v₋)/2
3. Interpretation: J·v̄ where v̄ = (v₊+v₋)/2 is the average velocity
4. Contrast with Remark 3.1b: corner has ΔH = 0 (J=0 → work zero)
5. The impulse-work formula is the discrete analog of P = F·v

Target: Remark 3.2a, +3 lines after the structural comment at line 98.
