# S47 Debate: Which Obstruction Should Anchor the "Newton-Limit Paradox"?

## Question
Should the cornerstone manuscript anchor the "refinement paradox" on:
1) non-uniqueness (ordering/scheme ambiguity), or
2) non-existence (no Lebesgue measure on path space)?

## Current Resolution
Use (2) as the crisp headline (a real theorem-like obstruction), and keep (1) as the immediate physics-facing companion: even when a definition exists (operator semigroup), multiple discretizations can land in different quantum theories unless one supplies a compatibility rule.
