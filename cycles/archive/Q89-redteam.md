## Failure modes
### 1. Pourciau2003 and Nauenberg1994 still PENDING (no OA full text acquired)
- Risk: a referee might check these citations and find we haven't fully engaged with the sources.
- Mitigation: both are cited for historical context (convergence debate), not for load-bearing claims. The paper's argument does not depend on their content. DOIs are confirmed.
### 2. Landsman1998 still PENDING_LIBRARY
- Risk: this is the most heavily cited source (7 occurrences). A referee could question depth of engagement.
- Mitigation: the citation is for standard deformation-quantization results that are well-known in the field. The paper's specific claims don't depend on details unique to Landsman's presentation.
