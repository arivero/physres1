# S254 — Execution
Verified: with K=GMm, the SR bound L/m > GM/c gives l_SR = GM/c.
The GR ISCO has l_ISCO = 2√3 GM/c (from L_ISCO = 2√3 M in G=c=1).
Ratio l_ISCO/l_SR = 2√3 ≈ 3.46 — a pure number quantifying the
curvature-induced tightening. Parallels the 1/6 precession ratio.
PROMOTED as C282 (Remark 4.3g).
