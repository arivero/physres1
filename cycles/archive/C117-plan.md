# C117 Plan: Promote S79 odd-dimension obstruction classification

Date: 2026-02-12

## Source
- `S79`: Odd-dimension obstruction — parity excludes odd d from integrality sieve
- Blackboard: `blackboards/2026-02-12-odd-dimension-half-density-obstruction.md`

## Goal
Add a remark (PA-D1.3a) to the Planck-area draft after PA-D1.3, classifying the three distinct obstruction mechanisms that make d=4 unique: parity (odd d), magnitude (even d ≥ 6), degenerate (d=2).

## Key content to promote
- Parity obstruction: for odd d, d/2 is half-integer but monomial dimensions are integer. Categorical.
- Magnitude obstruction: for even d ≥ 6, k = d/(2(d-2)) < 1. No positive integer solution.
- Degenerate: d=2, G₂ dimensionless.
- d=4 uniquely evades all three.

## Allowed files
- `papers/planck-area/main.md`

## Expected output
- 1 new remark (PA-D1.3a), ~3 lines
- Diffstat: small positive
