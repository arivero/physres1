# S28 Debate: Which Areal-Speed Clock Is Physically Preferred?

## Question
Should the project privilege \(dA/dt\) (external observer time) or \(dA/d\tau\) (proper time) when defining the areal-speed postulate?

## Current Resolution
Do not hard-code one as fundamental yet:
- record both branches explicitly;
- treat low-mass Compton behavior as robust;
- treat high-mass behavior (floor vs endpoint) as convention-sensitive pending a stronger physical criterion (e.g., operational observables or covariant formulation).
