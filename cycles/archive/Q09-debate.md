# Q09 Debate: Is H2.6a Too Close to “Why 4D”?

## Hard Question
Does introducing H2.6a risk shifting the Planck-area draft’s center of gravity from “scale from half-density scalarization” to “dimension selection”?

## Current Resolution
It’s acceptable provided:
- it stays short and clearly labeled as an *independent* filter,
- it is explicitly scoped (“within the conformal ansatz”),
- and it does not replace the core hypothesis ladder H2.1–H2.5.
