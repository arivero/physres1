## Hard question
Should D4.1b go in Section 6.3 or Section 10.2?

**Decision**: Section 6.3. The gap analysis identified Section 6.3 as needing a concrete example (it was just two sentences + H4.1 with no computation). D4.1b is the simplest instance of the Section 10.2 family, placed earlier for pedagogical immediacy. The cross-reference to Section 10.2 ties them together.
