## Failure Modes
1. Sign mistakes in imaginary parts (the \(+i0\) prescription) leading to wrong unitarity sign.
2. Mixing conventions between \(E\), \(k\), and prefactors \((2m/\hbar^2)\).
3. Overclaiming “no RG in 3D” (there is still scheme dependence and scale setting, but it is not the 2D log running story).

## Mitigations
- Derive imaginary parts using \(1/(x+i0)=\mathrm{PV}(1/x)-i\pi\delta(x)\).
- Keep normalization explicit and consistent across \(d\).
- Phrase conclusions as “log running vs power subtraction” rather than “RG vs no RG”.
