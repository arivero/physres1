## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. The foundational principle is a synthesis statement, not a single formal theorem in one framework.
2. Formal counterexamples to compatibility assumptions are not cataloged here.

## Evidence Needed
1. Add one stress-test example in a future revision where one compatibility axis fails and show how the framework diagnoses failure.
2. If needed, add a formal appendix proving equivalence/implication directions under stricter hypotheses.

## Closed Items
1. Continuation is now concept-driven and aligned with the manuscript's main narrative goal.
2. Strict-deformation continuation branch is removed from roadmap framing.
