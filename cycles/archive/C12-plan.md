# C12 Plan

## Goal
Start the Planck area / half-density scaling follow-up and anchor it to an ingested primary source.

## Scope
1. Ingest the local “On Planck Areal Speed” PDF into `sources/` and register a stable citation key.
2. Create `papers/planck-area/main.md` draft focusing on half-densities, scale normalization, and the \(d=4\) area specialness.
3. Update the bibliography ledger so the new key is consistent across the repo.

## Claims
1. Half-density normalization requires a \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scale; in \(d=4\) this is an area scale.
2. The Planck areal-speed analysis provides a concrete gravitational anchor for why a universal area scale is operationally meaningful in \(D=4\) inverse-square gravity.

## Risks
1. Treating dimensional bookkeeping as physics without a concrete kernel/groupoid model.
2. Mixing “Planck areal speed” results with half-density normalization without a clear interface lemma.

## Acceptance Tests
1. A converted source record exists in `sources/` for the areal-speed paper.
2. `paper/bibliography.md` includes a `[RiveroAreal]` entry.
3. `papers/planck-area/main.md` exists and references the new key where appropriate.
