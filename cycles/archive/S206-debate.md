# S206 — Debate

## Hard question
Is the mollifier–polygon parallel a genuine structural insight, or is
it a tautology dressed up with parallel columns? Every "take a limit
under regularity" argument has these stages.

## Resolution
The parallel is non-trivial for three reasons:

1. **Exactness at finite scale** distinguishes these from generic limit
   arguments. Not all refinement limits have an exact invariant at each
   finite step. The mollifier integral vanishes *exactly* (not approximately)
   at every ε > 0 — this is a consequence of stationarity being tested
   against all η, hence against ρ_ε·u for every ε. Similarly, the polygon
   area law is algebraically exact at every N. Most limit arguments (e.g.,
   Riemann sums converging to an integral) have only approximate intermediate
   values.

2. **Failure modes are physically meaningful.** When mollifier regularity
   fails → corners/impulses (distributional mechanics). When polygon
   convergence fails → the trajectory isn't differentiable. When time-slice
   normalization fails → the path integral diverges. These three failure
   modes map to three sections of the cornerstone's narrative, which is a
   non-trivial organizational claim about the paper's structure.

3. **The bridge through Section 4.5** connects the parallel to the paper's
   central thesis (refinement compatibility). The time-slicing bridge is
   literally the dirac-probes paper's link to the cornerstone's §6
   (composition law), and identifying it as a third instance of the same
   pattern adds structural coherence.

The parallel would be tautological only if *every* limit-under-regularity
argument had these features. It does not: convergence of Fourier series,
for instance, has no exact finite-scale invariant (partial sums oscillate)
and no single "regularity gate" (several distinct convergence theorems
with different hypotheses).
