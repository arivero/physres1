# S142 Execution: Wilson's RG as refinement management

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work Done
- Wrote blackboard slot 1: Wilson's blocking transformation, fixed points, universality, and dictionary to "uncuttable" themes.
- Statistical field theorist reviewed: all 6 claims CORRECT. Two minor nuances noted: (1) "QFT = fixed point" should be softened since physical QFT is a relevant deformation, (2) universality = refinement compatibility is the loosest analogy. References confirmed (Wilson 1971, Wilson-Kogut 1974, Wilson 1983 Nobel).
- Fix: promoted remark softened to "defined by the vicinity of an RG fixed point" (not "is the fixed point").
