# DX08 Plan: Blackboard triage
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Reduce blackboard count from 18 to ~16 by retiring absorbed content and consolidating overlapping notes.

## Actions
1. Retire `S89-sympy-verifications.md` — pure verification, absorbed into cycle file.
2. Consolidate `linear-vs-nonlinear-beta-transmutation.md` + `2d-delta-as-transmutation-instance.md` into a single merged note.
