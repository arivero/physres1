# C241 — Execution

## Work Done
1. Inserted Remark 2.3 (Born approximation bridge) after Remark 2.2:
   - Fourier transform of Yukawa = momentum-space propagator
   - Low-q expansion gives contact coefficients C₀ = g²/m², C₂ = -g²/m⁴
   - Range-mass relation as resolution limit
   - Beyond Born: T-matrix resummation → Examples 5.1–5.2

2. Inserted Remark 4.6 (Heavy-mediator decoupling) after Remark 4.5:
   - Decoupling limit M → ∞ with G = g²/M² fixed
   - Yukawa → delta contact limit
   - Wilson coefficient matching, universality
   - Appelquist-Carazzone theorem justification

3. Added reference [AppelquistCarazzone1975] (ref #40).
