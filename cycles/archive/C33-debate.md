# C33 Debate

## Question
Is this new draft redundant with existing materials in `paper/main.md`, `papers/planck-area/main.md`, and `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`?

## Working Resolution
It is a *bridge* draft: the existing texts mention the three delta roles separately; this draft aims to collect them into one coherent “delta semantics” note centered on half-densities. If it later proves redundant, it can be merged into an appendix of one of the follow-ups.
