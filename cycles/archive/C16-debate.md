# C16 Debate

## Question
Does the near-diagonal scaling/composition argument *really* force the introduction of a universal \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) constant, or does it only restate the conventional choice of units/measure?

## Notes
- Strong version: “background-free + dimensionless scalarization + no fractional powers” singles out \(d=4\) and yields an area scale (candidate: Planck area).
- Weak version: scaling fixes only the exponent \(d/2\) (square-root Jacobian), while the *value* of the scale is a convention unless further universality principles are imposed.
