# S209 — Debate

## Hard question
Is Remark 4.3 saying anything new? The paper already states
"the resolvent exponent d−2 arises from the heat kernel exponent
d/2 via a Laplace transform" (Remark 4.2, last sentence).

## Resolution
Remark 4.2 states the fact in one sentence. Remark 4.3 makes it
explicit with the integral formula, identifies d=2 as the critical
dimension from the convergence condition, and connects to the
half-density normalization of Section 2. The elaboration adds value
because the connection between t^{-d/2} (coordinate-free composition)
and the extension hierarchy (which dimensions admit point interactions)
is a central structural point of the paper's thesis.
