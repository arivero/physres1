# S213 Execution: Caustics, Maslov Index, Half-Density Resolution

## What Happened
1. Researched caustics and the Maslov index in the half-density framework
   using Bates–Weinstein (1997) and related sources.
2. Key finding: the divergence of √D at caustics is a projection artifact.
   The semiclassical state is a smooth half-density on the Lagrangian
   submanifold L ⊂ T*M; caustics occur when π: L → M folds.
3. The Maslov index μ counts conjugate points and is intrinsic to the
   metaplectic (Mp(2n)) structure of the half-density bundle.
4. Drafted Remark 3.5c for delta-objects (~8 lines).
5. Overwrote blackboard slot 2 (was SR precession, already promoted).

## Status: COMPLETE — ready for C249 promotion.
