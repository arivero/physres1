# Q130 — Debate

## Hard question
Is the ω–σ notation ambiguity a real issue or pedantry?

## Resolution
It's a real reader-experience issue: a reader who just parsed HD-D1.3
(where σ is the conformal factor) encountering ω in HD-D1.3b might
wonder about the connection. The one-sentence clarification costs
nothing and prevents confusion.
