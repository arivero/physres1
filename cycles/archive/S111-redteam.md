## Failure modes
1. **"Three action quantum numbers" language**: The subagent noted that (n,ℓ,m) are not all "action quantum numbers" in the strict Bohr-Sommerfeld sense (only L_z = mℏ is directly an angular momentum). Mitigated by adding "semiclassically" qualifier and saying "action integrals quantized by (n,ℓ,m)."
2. **Runge-Lenz vanishing expectation**: The claim "vanishes because it connects states of different ℓ" is correct by selection rules (Wigner-Eckart + ℓ→ℓ±1 matrix elements), but a hostile referee might ask for a formal proof. The claim is standard (Sakurai, Messiah, etc.) so this risk is low.
