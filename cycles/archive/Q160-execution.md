# Q160 Execution

**Verdict: PASS**

1. **Schwartz theorem**: Correctly stated — no associative algebra containing D'(R) can extend pointwise multiplication of C⁰ functions. The 1954 attribution is standard.

2. **QFT connection**: Accurate. Loop integrals involve G(x,y)² evaluated at x=y, where G(x,x)~t^(-d/2). This is precisely the perturbative UV divergence obstruction.

3. **Cross-reference to Remark 5.2b**: Verified. The d/2 exponent link is explicit (line 231: "diagonal singularity G(x,x)~t^(-d/2) (Remark 5.2b)").

4. **Table hierarchy**: Clear and correct. Rows 1-2 (mollifier probes, corner/impulse matching) involve no products → safe. Rows 3-4 (delta potentials d=1, d≥2) involve single diagonal evaluation → manageable via self-adjoint extensions. Row 5 (δ²) involves genuine products of singular distributions → requires full renormalization machinery.

5. **Placement**: Correct. Remark 5.3a (lines 230-231) immediately follows the summary table (Section 5.3, lines 220-228) and precedes Outlook (Section 6, line 233).

**Bibliography check**: Hormander2003 is cited in the reference list (line 244) and includes "Schwartz kernel theorem" in its annotation, supporting the Schwartz impossibility claim.

**Minor observation**: The remark does not explicitly cite a Schwartz 1954 source, but this is a well-known result in distribution theory and Hormander2003 is a standard authoritative reference. No action needed.
