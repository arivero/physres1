# Q47 Red Team: What a Referee Might Attack in the Action–Angle Note

Date: 2026-02-11

## Likely referee objections
- “Angle operators are subtle; your commutator is not legitimate”:
  - Mitigation: keep the note framed in terms of \(E=e^{i\phi}\) and explicit \(L_z=-i\hbar\partial_\phi\) eigenmodes; avoid claiming existence of a global self-adjoint \(\phi\).
- “Uniform in \(\phi\)” is too strong / unclear:
  - Mitigation: specify explicitly “for \(L_z\) eigenstates” and point to \(|e^{im\phi}|^2=1\).
- “This is too trivial for a foundations audience”:
  - Mitigation: emphasize the interpretive payload (stationary eigenstates vs packets) and keep the note tightly scoped as a clarification that prevents category mistakes.
- “Outlook gestures toward full action–angle/EBK but provides no detail”:
  - Mitigation: keep the outlook minimal (already done) and, if expanded later, spawn a dedicated `S` cycle with a single lemma-level target.
