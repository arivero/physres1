# C229 Redteam: Crossing Symmetry Promotion

## Promotion Checklist
- [x] Blackboard (S188) fully reviewed and approved
- [x] Content drafted and verified for physics
- [x] Cycle-tag leak check: PASS
- [x] Transcript mention check: PASS
- [x] Diffstat recorded: +8 -0
- [x] No empty diffs (content genuinely added)

## Blocking Issues
None. All S188 redteam items resolved. Ready for commit.

## Final Physics Check
Remark 2.2 correctly states:
1. Mandelstam analyticity is assumption (not theorem)
2. Grassmann obstruction orthogonal to channels
3. Fermion crossing spinor sign conventions

All approved by S-matrix theorist reviewer.
