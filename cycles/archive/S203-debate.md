# S203 — Debate

## Key question
Should the remark state the full U(2) family of point interactions in d=1,
or just the delta subfamily (psi continuous at origin)?

## Resolution
Delta subfamily only. The paper's Section 4 defines V = g|0><0| which
assumes psi(0) is well-defined (continuity at origin). The full U(2)
family includes delta-prime and more exotic interactions that are not
rank-one perturbations. Mentioning U(2) would require explaining the
transfer matrix parameterization, which is out of scope for this note.
