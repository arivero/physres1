# C42 Debate

## Question
Should the manuscript write the full constant \(A(t)=(m/2\pi i\hbar t)^{d/2}\), or only state that the delta limit fixes the constant (leaving \(2\pi\) conventions implicit)?

## Working Resolution
State the delta-limit fixing and give the standard flat-space constant parenthetically, while keeping “up to phase/conventions” language to avoid over-commitment.
