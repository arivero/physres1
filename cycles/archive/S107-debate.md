## Hard question
Should the general formula for [q^m, p^n]_⋆ be displayed, or just the m=n=3 result?

**Decision**: Display the general formula. It is finite, closed-form, and immediately explains why quadratics have no corrections (min(m,n)≤2 kills all k≥3 terms). Without the general formula, the cubic result appears as an isolated computation rather than part of a systematic pattern.
