# DX11 Execution: Cross-thread probe (relativistic-orbit thresholds vs RCP framing)

Date: 2026-02-14
Status: Completed

## Surprise inventory
- Confirmed that the same numerical value \(q=2\) in SR comes from two independent channels: (i) asymptotic kinetic-degree threshold \(\nu+1\), and (ii) algebraic dimensional identity \(v=K/L\) for inverse-square law.

## Cross-thread probe
- Wrote one connection equation:
  - asymptotic channel: \(E_\mathrm{kin}(p)\sim p^\nu,\ p\sim L/r \Rightarrow q_\mathrm{crit}=\nu+1\)
  - dimensional channel: \([K/L]=\) velocity iff \(q=2\).
- These channels are compatible but non-identical; they should not be merged into one explanatory claim.

## Framing stress-test
- RCP remains viable if mechanism labels are explicit: refinement-compatible outcomes may coincide numerically while originating from distinct invariance requirements.

## Candidate principle
- No new candidate this round.

## File updates
- Updated `docs/anomalies.md` with a resolved DX11 entry.
- No principle-version bump in `docs/research-state.md` (clarification, not a new thesis version).
