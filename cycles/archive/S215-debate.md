# S215 Debate: Newton Polygon Angular Momentum + Corner Example

## Was the Section 4.4 expansion worth it?

**Pro:** The connection to Newton's Principia Prop. 1 is the deepest historical
link in the paper. The original 7-line version only stated the result; the
expansion shows WHY (parallelogram construction) and connects to the paper's
overarching theme (distributional mechanics as modern underpinning of classical
constructions). The "algebraic identity at each finite step" framing also
resonates with Remark 2.3's parallel between mollifier localization and
polygonal refinement.

**Con:** The paper was already 4pp; adding content pushes toward 5pp. But
6pp is the cap, so there's headroom.

**Decision:** Keep. The expansion adds genuine mathematical content (explicit
polar decomposition, Newton's geometric argument, finite-step exactness).

## Was Example 3.1a worth adding?

**Pro:** Fills a pedagogical gap — the reader sees the impulse worked model
(Section 4) before seeing what happens WITHOUT an impulse (the degenerate
case where the corner condition kills the kink). The soft/hard junction
language is concise.

**Con:** It's a trivial example (v⁺ = v⁻ is immediate from Theorem 3.1
for this Lagrangian). But trivial examples are often the most illuminating
for understanding what a theorem says.

**Decision:** Keep. Short, clarifying, well-placed.
