# S24 Execution: SR Circular-Orbit Constraints

## Work Completed
- Derived the SR circular-orbit condition for a power-law central force \(F=K/r^q\) using \(F=\gamma m v^2/r\) and \(L=\gamma m r v\).
- Specialized to inverse-square \(q=2\), obtaining \(v=K/L\) and the admissibility bound \(L>K/c\).
- Recorded the radius formula and its Newtonian limit.
