# S29 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Pseudo-covariance:** using a quantity that is only “covariant” after fixing a source frame.
2. **Claim inflation:** presenting \(\ell\)-based branch as unique physical truth.
3. **Notation collision:** confusing \(\ell\) (specific angular momentum) with length scales.

## Mitigations
1. State explicitly that covariance is relative to given source 4-velocity \(U^\mu\).
2. Keep D1.5b and D1.5c as alternative postulates; present \(\ell\)-branch as structurally preferred candidate, not proof.
3. Reserve \(\ell\) only for specific angular momentum and keep \(L_P, M_P\) notation unchanged.
