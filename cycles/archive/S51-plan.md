# S51 Plan: Choose a Crisp Divergence/RG Witness for the Introduction

## Goal
Decide whether `Heuristic H0.2` item 3 ("Divergence") should get a one-line concrete witness in the Introduction, and if so, choose the smallest non-distracting witness consistent with project priorities (avoid overfocusing on point potentials).

## Options to Evaluate
1. **Toy calculus witness**: difference quotient needs subtraction of a \(1/\varepsilon\) piece ("derivative as counterterm").
2. **2D contact witness**: log divergence in 2D delta/contact interaction and dimensional transmutation (already derived later).

## Acceptance Tests
- Decision recorded with exact proposed wording for a `C78` promotion if we choose to add it.
- Avoid introducing a new technical rabbit hole in the Introduction.
