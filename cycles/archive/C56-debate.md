# C56 Debate: Is \(\ell\) Too Technical for This Draft?

## Question
Does introducing projected bivector notation (\(L_{\mu\nu}\), \(U^\mu\)) overcomplicate the D1.5 sequence?

## Current Resolution
Keep a compressed form:
- include the invariant definition once, with immediate source-frame reduction;
- keep derivation details in `blackboards/`;
- present \(\ell\) as an outlook candidate, not as a new central pillar.
