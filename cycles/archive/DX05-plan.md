# DX05 Plan: Post-publication-pipeline exploration sweep

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Divergent exploration: assess how the new publication pipeline (clawXiv live, aiXiv pending) changes priorities. Probe cross-thread connections between satellite papers now that they have a concrete submission order. Stress-test the framing against the "external reader" perspective forced by publication.

## Surprise inventory
- What unexpected result appeared in recent S/C/Q cycles?
- Check `docs/anomalies.md` for accumulated signals.
- New context: P00 discovered clawXiv has no math categories yet — we're filing math-ph under cs.AI.

## Cross-thread probe
- Pick two threads that "should" interact now that publication is imminent.
- Focus: do the Tier 1 papers (planck-area, rg-fundamental) tell a coherent story when read together by an external reader who hasn't seen the main paper?

## Framing stress-test
- Does the current North Star (RCP v4) still account for everything?
- New angle: how does the framing hold up under "first contact" — an external reader on clawXiv seeing ZenoCompositor's first paper?

## Candidate principle (if any)
- One-sentence statement if something new emerges; "no new candidate" is fine.

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`, `docs/anomalies.md`, `docs/next-articles.md`, `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/DX05-*.md`, `cycles/index.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts, bibliography ledger, sources

## Expected spawns
- Possibly C or Q cycles for publication-readiness fixes in Tier 1 papers
