# Q04 Debate

## Question
Should BV half-densities appear in wave 1 at all, or should the draft be spacetime-only until a bibliography cycle anchors BV claims?

## Working Resolution
Keep BV as a single “outlook” paragraph only, explicitly framed as heuristic and queued for a later bibliography cycle if promoted.
