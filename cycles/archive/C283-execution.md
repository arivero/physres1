# C283 — Execution
Inserted Remark 3.1a (Newtonian limit: structural cleanliness) after
the bound-orbit conclusion in Section 3.1. +3 lines.

The remark classifies c→∞ limits into three categories: kinematic
corrections vanish, admissibility bounds relax to trivial, and core
geometric relations are recovered exactly. Connects directly to the
paper's "refinement-witness" framing.
