# Q54 Plan: Referee pass on C97 standalone support for half-density QFT note

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C97`: inline minimal support in `papers/half-density-qft/main.md`

## Goal
Referee-pass the C97 edits for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q54-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`
- `docs/`, `cycles/index.md`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: “normalization witness” and the conformal \(D=4\) cancellation are scoped as computations, not interpretations.
- Notation: consistent use of \(D\) for spacetime dimension; no hidden assumptions about signature.
- Reader flow: new derivation blocks read as optional support and do not disrupt the note’s main message.

## Acceptance criteria
- Required follow-ups expressed as spawned cycles (no direct manuscript edits here).
