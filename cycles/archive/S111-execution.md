## Subagent feedback (pedantic atomic physics professor)
No critical errors. Key fixes applied:
1. "orbital plane has no preferred azimuthal orientation" → "in-plane orbit orientation has no preferred direction (the Runge-Lenz vector has vanishing expectation value, since it connects states of different ℓ)" — more precise, avoids undefined "orbital plane" concept in eigenstates
2. Added "semiclassically" qualifier: "Semiclassically, the bound orbits lie on a three-torus with action integrals quantized by (n,ℓ,m)"
3. Confirmed n²-fold degeneracy is correct (non-relativistic, spinless)

## Promotion (C152)
Example 6.2 inserted in Section 6, after Example 6.1. Outlook updated to reference "one, two, and three" action-angle pairs. Satellite 96 → 100 lines (+4 net; build adds [Sakurai2020] reference).

## Result
The three witnesses now form a clean progression: 1D HO (d=1 action-angle pair), azimuthal φ/L_z (d=1 pair in central potential), and hydrogen atom (d=3 pairs with SO(4) symmetry).
