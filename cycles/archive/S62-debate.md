# S62 Debate: Do we include an explicit uncertainty inequality?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
Do we state an inequality \(\Delta m\,\Delta\phi \gtrsim 1\) explicitly, or keep it qualitative (“Fourier tradeoff”)?

## Decision
Keep it qualitative, with one short sentence “Fourier tradeoff” explanation; avoid fragile constants/definitions.

## Rationale
The note’s purpose is conceptual hygiene, not a sharp bound.
