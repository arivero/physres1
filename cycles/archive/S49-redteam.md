# S49 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Too toy**: readers dismiss \(H=pq\) as unphysical.
2. **Sign confusion**: the operator mapping \(\hat p\hat q\) vs \(\hat q\hat p\) is easy to mis-state.
3. **Overgeneralization**: implying all discretizations are inequivalent rather than often related by conventions/unitary equivalences in specific settings.

## Mitigations
1. Frame as a *minimal witness* of ordering ambiguity, not as the final physical case study.
2. Show the three special cases explicitly and keep the derivation short.
3. Phrase the moral as: "refinement needs an explicit prescription/equivalence", not "no canonical choice exists in all contexts."
