## Content Added
Example 4.1 (1D delta potential: resolvent as a rank-one perturbation) added to delta-objects satellite Section 4, after the existing rank-one kernel formula.

Shows:
1. Free resolvent G_0(x,x';E) = -m/(ℏ²κ) e^{-κ|x-x'|}
2. Rank-one perturbation formula with factored correction f(x)·f(x')
3. Bound state at E = -mg²/(2ℏ²) as pole, residue = rank-one projector |ψ_b⟩⟨ψ_b|
4. Half-density interpretation: factored piece is product of half-densities

## Also in this cycle
Q106 fix applied to uncuttable satellite Remark 3.3:
- Convergence order phrasing corrected (O(1/N) → O(1/N²) for symmetric splitting)
- Domain conditions specified (self-adjoint, essentially self-adjoint sum)
- Citation [FeynmanHibbs1965] added
