# S226 — Execution: ISCO binding energy efficiency

## Outcome
Verified E²(6M) = (6M-2M)²/(6M·3M) = 16/18 = 8/9, so E_ISCO = 2√2/3 ≈ 0.9428.
Binding energy fraction η = 1 - 2√2/3 ≈ 5.72%.

Standard result: maximum radiative efficiency of thin-disk accretion onto
Schwarzschild BH. The SR model has no ISCO, hence no finite efficiency bound.
