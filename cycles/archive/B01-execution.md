# B01 Execution

## Work
1. Captured an OA-stable PDF mirror for Jackiw’s MIT-CTP-1937 delta-function note and ingested it to `sources/`:
   - input: SMU-hosted PDF mirror
   - capture: `sources/jackiw-d3bfc358.md` (gitignored)
2. Added one primary OA anchor for the Van Vleck semiclassical prefactor lore:
   - Van Vleck (PNAS 1928) record captured via PMC as `sources/pmc1085402-e8895437.md` (gitignored)
3. Updated `paper/bibliography.md`:
   - `[Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials]` moved from `PENDING` to acquired + OA mirror URL recorded.
   - Added `[VanVleck1928Correspondence]` and marked acquired.

## Result
- Independent anchoring for the delta/point-interaction thread now includes Jackiw’s standard 2D/3D delta note, and the semiclassical prefactor thread has a primary Van Vleck anchor suitable for referee-facing citations.

## Status
Completed.
