# S208 — Plan

## Goal
Address open question #4: provide a concrete worked example connecting
the perturbative contact expansion C₀ + C₂q² + ... to non-perturbative
content (bound states, resonances) via rational approximation.

## Scope
- Tree-level: Yukawa exchange A(q) = g²/(q²+M²). Contact expansion is
  the Taylor series. Padé [0/1] approximant recovers the pole exactly.
- Loop-level: vacuum polarization Π(q²) has a branch cut at q²=4m².
  Borel–Padé of the Taylor coefficients in principle recovers the
  discontinuity.
- Connection to fermionic paper (Remark 3.5 dispersion relations) and
  uncuttable paper (Remark 2.8 resurgence).

## Acceptance tests
1. Tree-level Padé recovery is explicit and verified.
2. Loop-level connection to dispersion relations is clearly stated.
3. Identifies what remains open (loop-level Borel–Padé computation).
