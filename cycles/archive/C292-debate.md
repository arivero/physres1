# C292 Debate: How far should Package A be pushed in the main paper?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Should Package A jump directly to full constructive path-space control, or proceed through a bounded-potential witness level?

## Options
1. Attempt full constructive path-space development now.
2. Promote a bounded-potential first-order witness and keep full constructive theory explicitly open.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
The paper needs concrete progression without overextending. A bounded-potential Duhamel witness is nontrivial and compositional, while full constructive measure theory remains a larger research program.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Optional next: dedicated S/C chain for stronger potential classes (Kato/form-bounded settings).
