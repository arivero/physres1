# C265 — Plan: Dirac-probes Remark 4.3c (Weierstrass excess function)

Promote S230 study. Insert Remark 4.3c after Remark 4.3b: Weierstrass
excess function E = m/2(ẋ'-ẋ)² upgrades Jacobi sufficiency from weak
to strong minimality. Kinked trajectory is concrete strong competitor.
Target: +3 lines, stay within 5pp.
