# S235 — Plan: Kepler's third law in Schwarzschild geometry

Study the coordinate orbital frequency for Schwarzschild circular orbits.
Key result: ω_φ² = M/r₀³, identical to the Newtonian Kepler third law.
This is exact (not an approximation) in Schwarzschild coordinates.
The proper period T_proper = T_coord × √(1-3M/r₀) includes a gravitational
time-dilation factor. At ISCO (r₀=6M), T_proper/T_coord = 1/√2.
