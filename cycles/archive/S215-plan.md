# S215 Plan: Newton Polygon Angular Momentum + Corner Example

## Objective
Study two expansion targets for dirac-probes-corners-impulses:

1. **Section 4.4 expansion**: Explicit 2D polar-coordinate calculation showing
   angular momentum conservation under a radial impulse. Connect to Newton's
   Principia Prop. 1 polygon construction where N central impulses at equal
   time steps produce equal swept areas exactly at every step.

2. **Example 3.1a**: A worked corner example (two-segment free particle with
   velocity kink) showing explicitly that canonical momentum is continuous
   across the corner, contrasting with the impulse case.

## Method
- Research Newton's Prop. 1 argument structure
- Work out explicit 2D polar-coordinate impulse calculation
- Draft both expansions
- Feed to C250 for promotion
