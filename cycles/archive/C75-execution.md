# C75 Execution: Cite the Path-Space Measure Obstruction

## Changes
- Added an inline citation to `paper/main.md` `Heuristic H0.2a`:
  - `[Velhinho2017InfDimMeasure]` for the "no translation-invariant \(\sigma\)-finite Borel measure in infinite dimensions" statement.

## Guardrails
- `rg -n 'C[0-9]{2}' paper/main.md` (clean; no matches).

## Diffstat
```text
paper-diffstat (cached): TOTAL +1 -1 (1 files)
  +1 -1 paper/main.md
```

## Result
The measure-theory obstruction in the Introduction is now explicitly anchored to an external OA reference.
