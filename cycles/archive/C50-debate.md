# C50 Debate: Where to Place \(\tau\) in the Cornerstone Paper?

## Options
1. Section 6 (kernel composition / time-slicing), emphasizing “compare discretizations”.
2. Section 8 (RG as refinement compatibility), emphasizing “parameter flow makes coarse-graining close”.
3. Section 10.3 (RCP appendix), emphasizing commuting-diagram axioms.

## Current Resolution
Place it in Section 8.2: it directly complements the existing renormalization-map semigroup statement and keeps the \(\tau\) discussion tied to “scale compatibility”.
