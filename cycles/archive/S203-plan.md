# S203 — Plan

## Goal
Study self-adjoint extensions of the Laplacian restricted to R^d\{0}
as background for a new remark in the delta-objects paper (Section 4).

## Scope
- Classification by dimension: d=1 (coupling), d=2 (transmutation scale),
  d=3 (scattering length), d>=4 (no extensions).
- Sobolev embedding argument for the d>=4 threshold.
- Green function diagonal singularity across dimensions.
- Connection to RCP / scalarization in Section 5.

## Acceptance
- Blackboard note (BB1) with reviewed content.
- Reviewer corrections incorporated before promotion.
