## Failure Modes
1. Duplicating existing material (D1.2a) instead of sharpening it.
2. Introducing “\(\delta\)” language that invites distribution-theory objections without adding value.
3. Smuggling cycle metadata into rendered manuscript content (policy violation).

## Mitigations
- Keep the derivation short and place it immediately after the near-diagonal scaling lemma where it functions as a concrete example.
- Phrase the delta object as the Schwartz kernel of the identity operator on half-densities (operator statement, not a “function”).
- Keep cycle labels confined to `cycles/` and `docs/`.
