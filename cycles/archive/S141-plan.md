# S141 Plan: Spin coherent states on S²

Date: 2026-02-13

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md` (potential)

## Scope
Study spin coherent states (Radcliffe 1971, Perelomov 1972) as the angular-momentum analog of harmonic oscillator coherent states. They localize direction on S² at the cost of m-spread, with angular uncertainty ~1/√j. Blackboard slot 0.
