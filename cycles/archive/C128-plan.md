Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle (required)
- `Q82`: referee pass found three fixable issues.

## Goal
Fix three issues for Tier 1 readiness:
1. Remove internal path `paper/main.md` from line 10.
2. Replace "tracks a conversation branch" with proper language on line 12.
3. Fill YAML metadata (author, date).

## Allowed files
- `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`
- `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.tex` (rebuild)
- `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.pdf` (rebuild)

## Scope
Three small edits. No structural or mathematical changes.
