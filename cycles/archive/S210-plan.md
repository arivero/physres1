# S210 — Plan

## Goal
Analyze open question #5: does the RCP framing add to the standard anomaly-matching
story? Is there a refinement-compatibility characterization that's cleaner?

## Sources
- Uncuttable Remark 4.5 (anomalies as topological constraints on refinement limit)
- Fermionic Remark 6.6 ('t Hooft anomaly matching in fermion-to-composite chain)
- HD-QFT §7 (BV half-densities outlook)
- Fujikawa (1979): path integral measure and chiral anomaly

## Key question
Does the half-density composition viewpoint give a geometric interpretation of
the anomaly that goes beyond Fujikawa's "measure transforms" statement?

## Acceptance tests
1. Identify the precise relationship: anomaly ↔ half-density composition defect.
2. Honest verdict: new constraints, or just conceptual reframing?
3. Update motivations.md question #5 status.
