# C21 Debate

## Question
Is “RG-generated scale supplies half-density scalarization” strong enough to motivate a *universal* area scale in \(d=4\), or do we need additional gravity-specific assumptions to justify calling it Planckian?

## Notes
- Half-densities force a \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) weight only under H2.3 (dimensionless scalars) + H2.4 (background-free constancy).
- H2.5 (no fractional powers) is a selection rule, not a geometric necessity.
- RG invariants (dimensional transmutation) provide a different, non-analytic scale-supplier mechanism.
