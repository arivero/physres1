# S200 — Execution

## Work Done
1. Wrote blackboard 0 with Born approximation bridge content:
   - Fourier transform of Yukawa = propagator in momentum space
   - Low-q expansion produces contact coefficients C₀, C₂, ...
   - Range-mass relation as Fourier duality
   - Connection to ERE (Remark 4.2) and T-matrix (Examples 5.1–5.2)
2. Spawned subagent reviewer (persona: applied scattering theorist).
3. Reviewer feedback applied to blackboard.

## Result
Blackboard 0 ready for promotion to Remark 2.3 in fermionic paper.
No new specialized references needed (textbook material).
