### D5.1b: CLEAN
- General formula verified ✓
- k=1 and k=3 terms computed independently ✓
- min(m,n)≤2 claim verified ✓
- Narrative flow smooth ✓

### Proposition 4.2: CLEAN
- [L_z, cos φ] = iℏ sin φ verified ✓
- [L_z, sin φ] = -iℏ cos φ verified ✓
- Var(cos φ)+Var(sin φ) = 1-R² verified ✓
- Final bound verified ✓
- MODERATE: transition from Example 4.1 to Prop 4.2 slightly abrupt → added one transitional sentence.
