# S25 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. Mixing conventions for \(E\) (per unit mass vs not) without stating it.
2. Confusing proper-time derivatives and affine-parameter derivatives.
3. Stating photon sphere/ISCO values without derivation.

## Mitigations
1. Define \(E,L\) explicitly from the metric and Killing vectors.
2. Keep two separate cases: timelike (\(\epsilon=1\)) vs null (\(\epsilon=0\)).
3. Derive \(r_{\text{ph}}=3M\) explicitly; keep ISCO as optional.
