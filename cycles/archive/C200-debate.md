# C200 Debate: Promote anomalous magnetic moment

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Remark completes the QED loop triptych: vacuum polarization (Section 3.1), vertex correction (Remark 3.3), pair production (Remark 3.4).
- The most precisely tested prediction in physics — direct demonstration of fermion-loop effects.
