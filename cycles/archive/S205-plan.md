# S205 — Plan

## Goal
Derive the SR orbit equation for the inverse-square force, showing:
1. The orbit is a precessing ellipse with frequency ω² = 1 − K²/(c²L²)
2. Precession per orbit: Δφ = 2π/ω − 2π ≈ πK²/(c²L²) (weak field)
3. For gravity: Δφ_SR = πGM/(c²a(1−e²)) = (1/6) × Δφ_GR

## Scope
- Binet equation derivation for SR Kepler
- Precessing ellipse solution
- Weak-field approximation and comparison with GR
- Blackboard note for promotion into relativistic orbits paper

## Acceptance tests
1. SymPy confirms SR/GR ratio = 1/6
2. Derivation is self-contained from the paper's Section 2 setup
3. Result connects naturally to Section 4's GR baseline
