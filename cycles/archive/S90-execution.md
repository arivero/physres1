# S90 Execution: Content assessment of uncuttable paper
Date: 2026-02-13

## Current structure
1. **Definition** (Section 1): "uncuttable" = limit object requiring refinement rule + comparison structure.
2. **Toy model** (Section 2): Riemann integral as refinement limit. Minimal.
3. **Dynamics** (Section 3): Connects to discrete action and singular probes. Brief.
4. **Outlook** (Section 4): Points to companion papers for details.

## What's missing
1. **No explicit quantum example.** The path integral is THE example of "uncuttable as refinement limit" — but the paper only gestures at it through the action approximant. A short Section 3.5 showing the time-sliced path integral as a concrete instance of the definition would strengthen the paper significantly.

2. **No connection to the historical term.** The word "atom" (ἄτομος, "uncuttable") comes from Democritus. The paper redefines it but doesn't acknowledge the historical context or explain why the redefinition matters. A single paragraph in Section 1 would suffice.

3. **No worked convergence/failure example.** Section 2 says "the limit can fail to exist" but gives no explicit failure case. A one-line example (e.g., Dirichlet function, or the 1/ε divergence requiring counterterm subtraction from D6.3 of the cornerstone) would make the point concrete.

4. **No ℏ as control parameter.** The paper's thesis maps directly to the cornerstone's H0.3 (constants as control parameters). A brief remark connecting ℏ → 0 to the "control parameter for the refinement limit" would tie the note to the broader program.

## Recommended additions (in priority order)
1. **Path-integral paragraph** in Section 3 (~10 lines): the time-sliced composition is the definition's items 1-3 applied to quantum amplitudes, with ℏ as the control parameter.
2. **Historical etymology remark** in Section 1 (~5 lines): acknowledge Democritus; explain the shift from "indivisible substance" to "limit-requiring refinement."
3. **Failure example** in Section 2 (~5 lines): divergent refinement limit (the 1/ε subtraction from D6.3) as a concrete case where naive "cutting" fails.

Total: ~20 lines, bringing the paper to ~80 lines (~4 pages). This keeps it concise while making it substantive.

## Assessment
The paper is currently a conceptual placeholder. Adding the three items above would make it a genuine note with intellectual content. This would be a C135 cycle.
