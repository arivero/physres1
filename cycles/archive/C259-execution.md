# C259 — Execution: Promote S224 into delta-objects

## Changes
Example 4.1b (d=2 delta potential: logarithmic divergence and transmutation scale)
inserted after Example 4.1 (d=1, line 164), before Remark 4.2 (line 166).

## Result
- Paper: 207 → 218 lines (+11), 6pp (6507 tok)
- At PLB ≤6pp boundary — no more additions without cuts.

## Diffstat
(to be filled after staging)
