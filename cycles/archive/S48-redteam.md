# S48 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Conflation**: mixing up δ′ with δ(f′) (stationary-set localization).
2. **Overinterpretation**: implying δ′ interactions are "real" without a model and regularization.
3. **Wrong discontinuity**: incorrectly stating which quantity jumps under δ vs δ′ forcing.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the duality definitions up front and use consistent notation.
2. Frame δ′ as distributional order bookkeeping unless a specific Hamiltonian model is fixed.
3. Include explicit integration-across-\(t_0\) checks in the toy examples.
