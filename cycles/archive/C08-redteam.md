## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. The worked example is a perturbative template; no full loop integral is shown.
2. Scheme dependence beyond leading order is not explored.
3. Four bibliography entries remain pending local ingestion (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).

## Evidence Needed
1. Add one explicit loop integral in a future appendix if numerical coefficients must be demonstrated from first principles.
2. Compare two renormalization schemes at next order if precision discussion is required.
3. Ingest local PDFs for pending references when provided.

## Closed Items
1. Subtraction/running mechanism is now explicit in manuscript equations.
2. Beta-function emergence is no longer only structural prose.
