# S33 Plan: Non-Planar Perturbations and the \(\ell\)-Rule

## Goal
Test whether the \(\ell\)-based areal-rate rule survives when motion is mildly non-planar (precessing/tilting orbital plane).

## Scope
1. Rewrite the planar scalar formulas in 3D vector/bivector form.
2. Identify what remains kinematic and what requires extra assumptions (e.g. central force).
3. Produce a compact statement suitable for promotion near D1.5g.

## Acceptance Tests
- Explicit 3D identities relating \(\boldsymbol\ell\), \(d\mathbf A/dt\), \(d\mathbf A/d\tau\).
- Clear caveat: scalar areal speed requires a chosen normal/plane.
