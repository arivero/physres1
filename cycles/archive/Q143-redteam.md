# Q143 — Red Team

## Remark 3.1b — could the variational argument be wrong?
No. The standard derivation (vary corner time t₀(ε), compute dS/dε = [H] dt₀/dε)
is well-established. Both branches satisfy E-L, so the chain rule gives [H] = 0.
This is Gelfand & Fomin Ch. 14 (corner conditions).

## Remark 4.3a — is the "leverage" interpretation misleading?
No. The factor t₀(T-t₀)/T = t₀(1-t₀/T) is the product of fraction-before ×
fraction-after × T. The maximum at midpoint is the AM-GM equality case.
The word "leverage" is informal but physically appropriate.
