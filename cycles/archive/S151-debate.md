# S151 Debate: Cooper pairing blackboard

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Most BCS physics correct. Critical error: photon mass formula confused gap Δ with superfluid density n_s.
- Corrected in promoted remark: m_A ∝ √(n_s e²) where n_s ∝ |Δ|².
- Cooper pairing is the ideal resolution of the fermionic obstruction — bypasses Grassmann sources by going to bilinear level.
