# Q38 Debate: How Many Witnesses Belong in the Introduction?

## Question
Should the Introduction carry explicit witnesses for all three obstructions in `Heuristic H0.2`, or keep only the minimal ones and move details later?

## Current Resolution
Keep explicit witnesses for (1) non-existence (measure) and (2) non-uniqueness (ordering) because they are hard to internalize otherwise, but keep the divergence/RG witness for later sections where computations already exist.
