# Q135 Execution: Referee Review of C249

## Result: CONDITIONAL PASS → fixes applied → PASS

### Issues found and resolution:

1. **"√D changes sign" imprecise** → Fixed: "the branch choice for √D becomes ambiguous"
2. **Hamilton annotation overstated** → Fixed: "appears here a century before Van Vleck takes its determinant for the semiclassical propagator prefactor"
3. **"metalinear bundle" jargon risk** → Fixed: replaced with "half-density bundle on L"
4. **Phase convention exp(−iπμ/2)** — correct, no change needed
5. **"Projection artifact" and "fold"** — correct geometric language, well-supported
6. **"Counting conjugate points"** — acceptable shorthand (algebraic count would be more precise but fine for a remark)

### Fixes applied in:
- `papers/delta-objects/main.md` (Remark 3.5c text + reference annotation)
- `paper/bibliography.md` (Hamilton1834 annotation)

### Verdict after fixes: PASS
