# S53 Plan: Generic-\(q\) Areal-Speed Scaling and Dimension Selection

## Goal
Re-derive (cleanly and self-contained) the generic power-law result behind `Remark D1.5a` in `papers/planck-area/main.md`, and sharpen the dimension-selection message:
only inverse-square forces (\(q=2\)) produce linear Compton scaling under a fixed areal-speed postulate, and in Newtonian Gauss-law gravity this corresponds to \(n=3\) spatial dimensions.

## Tasks
1. Write a blackboard note deriving the generic \(F=K/r^q\) circular-orbit scaling from \(\dot A=\tfrac12rv\).
2. Specialize to Newtonian Gauss-law gravity in \(n\) spatial dimensions (\(q=n-1\) for \(n>2\), with the \(n=2\) logarithmic exception).
3. Record a small promotion target for `C79`: tighten/extend `Remark D1.5a` with one line clarifying the \(n\)-dependence and the unique \(n=3\) cancellation.

## Acceptance Tests
- Derivation is algebraically correct and explicit about exceptions (\(q=3\), \(n=2\)).
- Clear message about where \(c,\hbar,G\) enter and why the cancellation is special in \(D=4\).
