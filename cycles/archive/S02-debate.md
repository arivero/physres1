# S02 Debate

## Question
Is the “scalarization gauge” of half-densities (choice of \(\sigma_\ast\)) merely a coordinate/measure convention, or can it carry physically meaningful scale dependence once we demand composed predictions be regulator-independent (i.e. once RG enters)?

## Working Resolution
Treat \(\sigma_\ast\) itself as a convention, but allow the *need* for a scale-dependent scalarization (or multiplicative renormalization of scalar representatives) to be forced by refinement compatibility. The physically meaningful objects should be RG-invariant combinations, not \(\sigma_\ast(\mu)\) itself.
