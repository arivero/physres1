# S140 Debate: Huang-Yang pseudopotential

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- The pseudopotential is a "smart" delta: it carries its own regularization prescription.
- Different scattering lengths a select different self-adjoint extensions — connects to the SAE framework of Section 5.
- The (∂/∂r)(r·) operator extracts the regular part: for ψ ~ A(1/r - 1/a) + regular, it yields -A/a (finite).
- Prefactor convention: 4πℏ²a/m is standard for distinguishable particles; the 2π version appears for identical bosons in some texts but 4π is the conventional choice.
