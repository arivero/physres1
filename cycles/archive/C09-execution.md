# C09 Execution

## Manuscript Deltas
1. Added appendix subsection `10.2` in `paper/main.md`.
2. Added explicit left-vs-Weyl ordering computation (`D9.1`).
3. Added discretization-ordering equivalence-class statement (`P9.1`).

## Equations Added
1. \(Q_W(A)=Q_L(A)-\frac{i\hbar}{2}f'(\hat q)\).
2. \(Q_W-Q_L=O(\hbar)\) with \(\hbar\to0\) agreement.

## Sections Touched
1. `paper/main.md`.
2. `paper/bibliography.md` (supporting references retained).

## Rationale
`C09` converts the ordering-ambiguity discussion into a checked calculation and keeps the foundational chain technically auditable.

## Acceptance Test Results
1. Labeled derivation and proposition present: passed.
2. Classical-limit agreement with subleading quantum shift explicit: passed.
