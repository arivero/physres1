# Q80 Debate

## Hard question
Should the main paper's Section 9.5 (Future Work) be updated to reference the companion papers more explicitly, now that they are P01-ready?

## Resolution
No. The main paper is designed to be standalone. Section 9.5's "extensions" are framed as things the main paper itself could include. The companion papers are separate publications with their own submission timelines. Adding explicit cross-references would create version dependencies between papers at different stages of the publication pipeline. The current generic pointer at line 544 ("a companion note") is the right level of coupling.
