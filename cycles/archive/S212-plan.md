# S212 — Plan

## Goal
Make explicit the unifying role of the exponent d/2 across three
manifestations in the delta-objects paper: identity kernel (§2),
heat kernel convergence (Remark 4.3), and Sobolev embedding (Remark 4.2).

## Key insight
The Sobolev embedding H^k → C^0 requires k > d/2 (same exponent).
For k=2 (Laplacian domain): 2 > d/2 ⟺ d < 4 — the Morrey threshold
in Remark 4.2. This is the same d/2 from the identity kernel scaling
(§2) and the heat kernel convergence (Remark 4.3).

The half-density exponent d/2 thus explains WHY these three independently
discovered facts share the same critical threshold.

## Target
Remark 5.1 in §5 (scalarization section): 2-3 lines connecting the
d/2 appearances across sections.

## Acceptance tests
1. Remark makes a specific structural connection (not just "d/2 appears").
2. Paper stays within PLB limit (191 → ~194 lines, still 4pp).
