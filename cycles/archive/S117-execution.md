## Content
1D delta-potential resolvent as rank-one perturbation of free resolvent:
- Free resolvent: G_0(x,x';E) = -m/(ℏ²κ) e^{-κ|x-x'|}
- Rank-one formula: G = G_0 + g·G_0(·,0)·G_0(0,·)/(1 - g·G_0(0,0))
- Bound state: pole at κ = |g|m/ℏ², giving E = -mg²/(2ℏ²)
- Residue factors as ψ_b(x)·ψ_b(x') = rank-one projector
- Half-density interpretation: factored piece is product of half-densities

## Subagent Review (pedagogical expositor)
- All formulas CORRECT
- Pedagogical clarity: CLEAR
- Strategic fit with delta-objects Section 4: EXCELLENT
- Minor suggestions: dimension remark, cite [AlbeverioGesztesyHoeghKrohnHolden2005] — both incorporated in promotion.
