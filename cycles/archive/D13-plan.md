# D13 Plan: Post-promotion housekeeping (cycle board + log) after `S67 → C99 → Q56`

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Update the durable planning artifacts after the `S67 → C99 → Q56` chain and set a short, concrete next-action list.

## Novelty candidates (shortlist)
1. `B12` (optional, time-capped): one more OA attempt for `[Dirac1933]`; otherwise keep `PENDING_LOCAL_PDF`.
2. `D14`: pick the next bounded novelty thread (spawn one concrete `S` deliverable).
3. `C100` (optional micro-polish): unify the elementary-differential notation in the step-doubling witness if desired (keep bundled with other work if possible).

## Decision criteria
- Keep the cycle board and research log consistent with the actual repo state.
- Keep the next-action list short and deliverable-focused.

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/D13-*.md`
- `cycles/index.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- None required (this is mainly planning/logging); queue next actions in `cycles/index.md`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Cycle board updated to include `C99`, `Q56`.
- Research log includes dated entries for `C99` and `Q56`.
- A clear “next action” list is set.
