## Risks
- Prefactor error caught and corrected (2π → 4π). Standard reference: Huang & Yang, Phys. Rev. 105 (1957) 767.
- Connection to SAE framework (Example 5.2) is natural and well-established.
- The operator (∂/∂r)(r·) acting on functions with 1/r singularity is mathematically rigorous in distribution sense.
