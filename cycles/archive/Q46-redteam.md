# Q46 Red Team: Possible Reviewer Reactions to `Remark D4.2b`

Date: 2026-02-10

## Objections
- “This is elementary and distracts.”
  - Mitigation: keep it short (already done) and ensure it is clearly tied to the paper’s stationary-phase interpretation.
- “Angle variables are subtle.”
  - Mitigation: we do not define an angle operator; we use only the separation-of-variables probability-uniformity witness.
