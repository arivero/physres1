# C73 Debate: Historical Framing or Purely Mathematical Note?

## Question
Should the new note include explicit historical framing (Democritus/pyramids) or remain purely mathematical/structural?

## Current Resolution
Keep it purely mathematical/structural for now. If we want historical claims, open a dedicated bibliography cycle first and keep that material in a separate draft.
