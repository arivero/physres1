## Failure Modes
1. Confusing stationary phase (asymptotics) with a literal limit producing a delta distribution without additional averaging.
2. Overstating “\(\delta(f')\)” as a theorem in contexts where critical points are degenerate or infinite.
3. Slipping from finite-dimensional calculus into functional integrals without flagging what changes.

## Mitigations
- Work in the clean nondegenerate finite-dimensional setting first; label generalizations as heuristic.
- Keep “half-density square root” in geometric language (supported measure/half-density), not scalar.
- Treat the functional delta \(\delta(\delta S/\delta\phi)\) only as an analogy/pointer.
