# S47 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim ("QM is forced")**: the lemma is about measure non-existence, not about logical inconsistency of classical mechanics.
2. **Irrelevance**: readers object that classical mechanics does not need path-space integration.
3. **Too abstract**: measure theory feels detached from the action-extremum argument.

## Mitigations
1. Phrase as: obstruction to *a particular refinement program* (composition by path-space integration).
2. Make the manuscript point conditional: "if we insist on defining amplitudes by refinement + composition, we immediately face this obstruction."
3. Add one concrete operational link: the remedy is exactly what we do (define kernels via finite refinement and semigroup/normalization constraints, accept scheme dependence where necessary).
