# S69 Debate: Where should the symplectic remark go?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Should the symplectic-Euler identification go in Section 3 (near the impulse model) or Section 8 (near the step-doubling analysis)?

## Options
1. Section 3.3, after H1.1a (the convergence remark): emphasizes that Newton's scheme has structural properties beyond convergence.
2. Section 8.4, after D6.2a: emphasizes the contrast between symplectic and non-symplectic integrators.
3. Both: a brief note in Section 3.3 with a forward pointer, and a fuller discussion in Section 8.4.

## Current position
Option 3 is ideal but risks scope creep. Option 1 is simpler and keeps the Newtonian material together. The Section 8 contrast (symplectic vs non-symplectic corrections) is interesting but may require more technical machinery (symplectic B-series) than we want to introduce.

Recommend: Option 1 for the C cycle, with a note that Section 8.4 could be extended later.
