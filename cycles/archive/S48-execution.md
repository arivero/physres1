# S48 Execution: Weak Euler-Lagrange with δ and δ′ Probes (Jump Conditions)

## Work
- Wrote a self-contained toy derivation note:
  - `paper/notes/weak-euler-lagrange-jump-conditions.md`
- Included two explicit point-supported source examples showing:
  - δ sources couple to \(\eta(t_0)\) and encode momentum jumps,
  - δ′ sources couple to \(\eta'(t_0)\) and encode configuration jumps.

## Result
We now have an explicit bridge between "distribution theory" and "stationary extremes of the action" that clarifies what is meant by the δ objects appearing in weak formulations (and how they differ from δ(f′) stationary-set localization).

## Next
- `C75`: add an inline citation for `Heuristic H0.2a` in `paper/main.md` (measure obstruction), and optionally add a one-line pointer from the "singular probes" discussion to the new jump-condition note.
