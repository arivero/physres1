# C125 Execution: Update rg-fundamental conclusion

Date: 2026-02-13

## What changed
- Section 7 (Conclusion and Outlook): added a sentence acknowledging RG-D1.2a's Wilsonian derivation. Adjusted "natural extensions" to specify "a standard QFT example (with a nontrivial fixed-point structure)" rather than the generic "one explicit Wilsonian... computation."
