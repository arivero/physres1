# C17 Debate

## Question
If the half-density scalarization scale can be supplied by an RG-invariant transmutation scale, does that weaken the “\(d=4\) is special” claim (and should it)?

## Notes
- Transmutation produces a scale from dimensionless couplings but is non-analytic in the naive coupling expansion.
- This suggests “special dimensions” may depend on whether we require analyticity (`H2.5`) or allow non-analytic emergence (RG).
