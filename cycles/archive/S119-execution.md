## Blackboard
Created `blackboards/2026-02-13-ere-contact-connection.md`:
- ERE formula: k cot δ₀(k) = -1/a + r₀k²/2 + O(k⁴)
- Contact expansion A(q) = C₀ + C₂q² + ... is the momentum-space dual
- Born-level map: C₀ → a, C₂ → r₀, higher C_{2n} → shape parameters
- Examples 5.1/5.2 are zero effective range (r₀=0, C₂=0)

## Subagent Review (skeptical nuclear physicist)
1. ERE formula: CORRECT standard form
2. Zero effective range claim: CORRECT, verified algebraically: f₀(k) = -a/(1+ika) matches ERE with r₀=0
3. Born-level C₀→a factor: 4π vs 2π convention-dependent — paper uses "∝" so safe
4. Recommendation: keep minimal, brief remark not full subsection
