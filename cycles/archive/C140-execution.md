# C140 Execution: N-impulse bridge in Dirac Probes satellite
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
Added Section 4.5 "From N impulses to the time-sliced path integral" to
papers/dirac-probes-corners-impulses/main.md. Shows discrete action on piecewise-linear
paths, classical stationarity recovering corner conditions, quantum sum yielding
time-sliced path integral with half-density normalization prefactor.
Paper: 172 → 193 lines (+21 net). Outlook item 1 marked as addressed.
