# S157 Debate: Conformal symmetry at RG fixed points

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- CFT as the "ultimate refinement limit" — scale-independent, self-determining via bootstrap.
- c-theorem/a-theorem as the "arrow of refinement" — irreversibility of coarse-graining.
- Completes the RG narrative of Remarks 4.1-4.5.
