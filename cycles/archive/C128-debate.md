## Hard question
Should the cornerstone reference be a formal citation rather than just "the cornerstone manuscript"?

## Resolution
No. The other satellite papers use the same generic pointer style ("the main paper," "the cornerstone manuscript"). A formal citation would require a citable version of the cornerstone paper, which isn't published yet. The generic pointer is appropriate for a companion note in a pre-publication collection.
