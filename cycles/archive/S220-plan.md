# S220 — Study: Relativistic stability expansion targets

**Parent**: cycles/index.md (PLB expansion: relativistic 239/4pp)
**Blackboard**: 3 (special dimensions / orbit analysis)

## Goal
Study two expansion targets for the relativistic-central-orbits paper:
1. Example 5.2b — Stability thresholds for specific power laws (q=1,2,5/2,3)
2. Remark 4.3b — ISCO as curvature-induced stability boundary (L²=12M² at r=6M)

## Method
- Sonnet subagent drafts both additions with concrete formulas
- Verify consistency with existing derivations in Sections 3, 4.3, 5.2
- Target: +12–16 lines total, keeping paper under 5pp
