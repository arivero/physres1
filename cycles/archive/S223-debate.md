# S223 — Debate

## Weierstrass–Erdmann second condition — is it needed?
Currently Theorem 3.1 only states momentum continuity (first condition).
The energy condition is the natural variational companion and appears in
all textbook treatments (e.g., Gelfand & Fomin §4). Including it makes
the paper's treatment of corners complete.

## Action excess remark — too elementary?
The observation that t₀(T-t₀)/T is maximized at the midpoint is trivial
arithmetic, but the physical interpretation (midpoint leverage) is
non-obvious and connects to the equal-area discussion in Section 4.4.
A 3-line remark is proportionate.
