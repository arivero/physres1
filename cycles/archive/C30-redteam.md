## Failure Modes
1. Overstating the identity without stating the nondegeneracy assumptions.
2. Confusing “stationary phase asymptotics” with a literal delta-limit theorem.
3. Adding too much technicality and slowing the narrative.

## Mitigations
- State the assumptions (finitely many nondegenerate critical points).
- Phrase stationary phase as “gives weights \(1/\sqrt{|f''|}\)” rather than as a limit producing \(\delta\).
- Keep it to one short labeled addendum.
