# C270 — Plan: Relativistic Remark 4.3f (Kepler third law in Schwarzschild)

Promote S235. Insert Remark 4.3f after Remark 4.3e, before Section 5.
Coordinate frequency ω² = M/r³ exact (Kepler third law unchanged), but
proper period picks up √(1-3M/r) time dilation. At ISCO, T_τ/T_t = 1/√2.
Target: +3 lines, stay within 5pp.
