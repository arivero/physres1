# S275 Plan: Compression candidates for possible C300

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycles
- `S273` (scope boundaries)
- `S274` (marginal parameter compactness)

## Goal
Produce candidate compressed manuscript sentences that preserve scope and technical correctness.

## Deliverable
- Update file:
  - `paper/notes/main-paper-threshold-bridge-sanity-grid.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S275-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- At least three candidate sentence variants documented.
- One recommendation selected with rationale.
- Command-backed compactness comparison logged.

## Iteration extension (same ID)
- Add a second-pass caveat-coverage audit to ensure the recommended blend retains all mandatory scope elements.
- Add a third-pass full two-sentence draft with compactness comparison for a default promotion candidate.
- Add a fourth-pass readability delta audit versus current manuscript wording.

## Policy addendum (session rule)
- Future S275 iterations will use `blackboards/` + `notebooks/` only; no new `paper/notes/` edits.

## Iteration 5 extension (append-only)
- Expand the caveat checklist to include explicit `small-r` scope and explicit non-classification wording (`not a full orbit theorem`).
- Re-evaluate default compression candidate under the stricter 8-item gate.

## Iteration 6 extension (append-only)
- Add a notation/style compatibility gate so the default compressed candidate is manuscript-ready without symbol-style rewrites.

## Iteration 7 scope correction (append-only)
- `S275` scope is restricted to technical/caveat validity checks for threshold-bridge compression.
- Editorial notation harmonization and manuscript-ready wording polish are treated as `D`/`C` responsibilities, not `S` deliverables.
