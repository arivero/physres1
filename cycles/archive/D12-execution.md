# D12 Execution: modified-equation witness for “running data” in step-doubling

Date: 2026-02-11

## Actions taken
- Chose the bounded novelty target: make the Euler step-doubling witness more explicit by adding a clean modified-equation expansion (order \(h^2\)) and fully spelling out the \(f'(f)\) elementary differential.
- Spawned `S67` to produce a standalone derivation/check suitable for promotion into `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`.

## Files changed
- Created the `cycles/D12-*.md` planning artifacts.
- Updated `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md` to reflect the new cycle and next actions.

## Status
Completed; work continues in `S67 → C99 → Q56`.
