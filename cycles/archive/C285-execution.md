# C285 — Execution

## Changes made

### 1. Remark 3.2b (Connection to Sommerfeld fine structure)
Inserted after Remark 3.2a (line 108 in new file). Sources: S262, S264.

Text: "For the Coulomb force K=Ze²/(4πε₀), the precession parameter ω²=1-K²/(c²L²)
is precisely the quantity Sommerfeld [Sommerfeld1916FineStructure] used to derive the
relativistic hydrogen fine structure. Applying Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization L=kℏ
yields ω=√(1-Z²α²/k²), where α is the fine structure constant, and the resulting
energy levels E_{n_r,k}=mc²(1+α²Z²/(n_r+kω)²)^{-1/2} reproduce the exact Dirac
spectrum (with k→j+½). The classical orbit equation of this section is thus the
backbone of one of the earliest quantum-relativistic results."

### 2. Outlook item 3
Added after item 2 in Section 6. Source: S263. Changed "Two" to "Three."

Text: "apply semiclassical quantization (Remark 3.2b) to ask which of the
admissibility, stability, and critical-exponent bounds derived here survive or
sharpen in the transition from classical orbits to discrete energy levels."

### 3. References [3] and [4]
Added Sommerfeld 1916 and Bertrand 1873 as references 3 and 4. Source: S264.

### 4. Citation in Remark 3.2a
Added [Bertrand1873ClosedOrbits] citation to existing Bertrand's theorem mention.

## Line count
280 → 286 lines. Still 5pp (PLB limit is 6pp ≈ 315 lines).

## Guardrails
- Cycle-tag leak check: clean (no C/S/Q labels in manuscript).
- Transcript citation check: clean (no conv_patched references).
