# Q31 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Ambiguity of adjoint kernel:** readers question why the conjugate appears in the backward slot.
2. **Operator-notation mismatch:** density-operator remark feels out of place in a propagator note.
3. **Hidden measure confusion:** readers suspect the doubled integral needs a background measure.

## Mitigations
1. Keep formula tied to \(\rho_t=U_t\rho_0U_t^{-1}\) and the displayed kernel composition.
2. Keep it one remark positioned immediately after propagator kernels.
3. Emphasize "product is a density in intermediate variables" as the reason the integral is canonical.
