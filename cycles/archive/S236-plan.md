# S236 — Plan: Dimensional regularization and the D/2 hierarchy

Study how the Seeley-DeWitt counterterm hierarchy (Remarks HD-D5.3, HD-D5.3a)
maps to dimensional regularization. The proper-time divergence Λ^{D-2n}
from a_n becomes a dim-reg pole 1/(D-2n) at the same critical dimension.
Both schemes are organized by the D/2 exponent: the mass pole at D=2,
wave function at D=4, next at D=6, etc.
