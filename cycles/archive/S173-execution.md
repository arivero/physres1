# S173 — Execution

Wrote blackboard on Tan contact (k^{-4} tail, adiabatic sweep, pressure, pair density). Reviewed by cold-atom physicist — caught: (1) g₂ notation wrong (should be pair density ρ₂), (2) "any statistics" too broad (Tan is for two-component Fermi gas), (3) pressure relation is for homogeneous systems, (4) RF tail needs final-state caveat.
