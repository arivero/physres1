# S55 Plan: Why \(\hbar\), \(c\), \(G\) as Control Parameters (Foundations View)

## Goal
Draft a cautious, derivation-compatible "constants as control parameters" viewpoint aligned with the manuscript's refinement/compatibility thesis:
explain why \(\hbar\), \(c\), and \(G\) naturally appear when one demands stable continuum limits across (i) quantization, (ii) relativity, and (iii) gravity.

## Tasks
1. Write a blackboard note articulating a three-parameter deformation/limit cube:
   - \(\hbar\to 0\) classical/stationary-phase,
   - \(c\to\infty\) Galilean/Newtonian,
   - \(G\to 0\) fixed-geometry/no-backreaction.
2. Tie each constant to a specific refinement-compatibility obstruction/control role in our narrative:
   - \(\hbar\): action-phase scaling and noncommutative deformation,
   - \(c\): time-length conversion and Lorentz-compatible refinement,
   - \(G\): coupling with length dimension linking mass/energy to geometry and (in \(D=4\)) Planck area.
3. Prepare a minimal promotion target for `C81` (one short heuristic block in `paper/main.md`).

## Acceptance Tests
- Claim hygiene: present as heuristic programmatic interpretation, not as a theorem.
- Wording is compatible with the manuscript’s staged construction and does not invoke new technical machinery.
