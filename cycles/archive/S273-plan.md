# S273 Plan: Assumption-break stress tests for threshold bridge

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Stress-test the threshold bridge by breaking key assumptions and documenting precisely what survives.

## Deliverable
- Update file:
  - `paper/notes/main-paper-threshold-bridge-sanity-grid.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S273-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- At least two explicit assumption-break tests documented.
- Objection-response entries included.
- Safe/unsafe claim split updated after stress test.
