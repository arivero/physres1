## Failure modes

### 1. Lightweight bibliography
- Risk: 2 references may look too sparse for a publication.
- Mitigation: both references are well-chosen and OA. The paper is intentionally a short self-contained note. A B cycle can add more if a reviewer requests context (e.g., Goldstein for classical mechanics, MTW or Weinberg for Schwarzschild).

### 2. Section 4 is standard textbook material
- Risk: a referee could object that the Schwarzschild section adds nothing new.
- Mitigation: Section 4 is explicitly framed as "baseline" (line 70: "records the standard Schwarzschild baseline"). Its purpose is to provide a parallel comparison frame for the SR results. The paper's contribution is the SR analysis (Sections 2-3, 5), not the GR review.

### 3. Missing connection to refinement spine
- Risk: the abstract and Section 1 promise a "refinement" connection, but Section 6 (Outlook) only gestures at it.
- Mitigation: the paper is a "dependent note" (line 12), not a standalone paper making a refinement claim. The refinement framing in the abstract is appropriate as motivation. A future C cycle could strengthen the outlook if needed.
