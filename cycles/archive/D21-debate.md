# D21 Debate: Main-paper brevity vs technical transparency

Date: 2026-02-14

## Current question
Should transparency be maximized in the main paper, or should we prefer terse bridges with companion-note pointers?

## Current stance
Leaning toward terse-bridge policy with explicit caveat checklist; keep active until we decide whether to trigger C300 now or later.

## Iteration 2 addendum
A quantitative gate (e.g., >=40% compression with caveat retention) helps avoid both over-compression and endless deferral.

## Iteration 3 addendum
A deterministic tie-break resolves indecision: if multiple candidates pass, pick higher caveat coverage before compactness.

## Iteration 4 addendum
Debate is now policy-only: readiness is sufficient, but launch is deferred unless readability is explicitly prioritized.

## Iteration 5 addendum
Launch readiness is now coupled to a style-clean candidate, reducing downstream editorial friction if C300 opens.

## Iteration 6 addendum
Cycle-boundary clarification accepted: technical validation in `S`, editorial launch prep in `D/C`.

## Iteration 7 addendum
Accepted: sentence-level notation harmonization is promotion work (`C`), not discovery work (`D`), unless TeX behavior itself is the discovery target.

## Re-anchor addendum
Resolved: this thread is not a discovery target; policy-only content should not have expanded under D.

## Closure addendum
Resolved: no discovery question remained active in D21; close.
