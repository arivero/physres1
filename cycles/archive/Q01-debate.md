# Q01 Debate

## Question
Are we using the new “standard anchors” (Jackiw / Van Vleck) in a way that is citation-honest (supporting the exact surrounding sentence), or are we sliding into name-dropping?

## Working Resolution
Treat Jackiw as a standard anchor for 2D/3D delta lore; treat Van Vleck as an attributional/heritage anchor unless we add a more direct semiclassical-propagator reference for the exact prefactor formula.
