# S218 — Red Team: HD-QFT expansion targets

## Attack 1: "The flat-space example is trivial"
**Response:** Pedagogically valuable — Section 4 was abstract with no explicit kernel.
Shows the D/2 exponent appearing in a concrete, verifiable formula.

## Attack 2: "The counterterm remark is just dimensional analysis"
**Response:** True, but the *kernel-level interpretation* is the paper's contribution:
the mass counterterm is δm² · K_Id, and its UV scaling is governed by the same
D/2 exponent as K_Id's normalization. That's not obvious without the half-density
framework.

## Attack 3: "Both additions rehash what's already implicit"
**Response:** Making implicit things explicit is the paper's entire raison d'être
(line 220: "once the hidden measure conventions are made explicit").

## Verdict
Low-risk additions. Both are well-scoped consequences of existing framework.
