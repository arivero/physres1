# Q182 Plan: Referee pass on C299 threshold-bridge insertion

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle
- `C299`

## Review scope
- Mathematical correctness of the \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\) statement at remark level.
- Scope hygiene (no overclaim beyond fixed-\(L\), small-\(r\) asymptotics).
- Notation consistency and narrative fit in Section 3.3.

## Acceptance criteria
- PASS if statement is correct at declared scope and no regressions introduced.
- Any required follow-up must be explicitly spawned.
