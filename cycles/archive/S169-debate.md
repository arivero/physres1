# S169 — Debate

**For:** Hamiltonian monodromy is the key obstruction to global action-angle variables;
GL(d,Z) transformation and quantum lattice defect give concrete geometric + semiclassical content.
**Against:** Duistermaat 1980 is the foundational reference — wrong citation would be embarrassing.
**Resolution:** Reference corrected (CPAM 33, not CMP 77). Physics stands; promote with fix.
