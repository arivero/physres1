# Q48 Red Team: What a Referee Might Attack in the RCP Closure Block

Date: 2026-02-11

## Likely referee objections
- “This is just notation; where is the constraint?”:
  - Mitigation: keep the explicit “there exists \(\theta'\)” framing and keep pointing to the semigroup-normalization witness as a concrete failure mode.
- “Symbols changed (\(t,\hbar,\Lambda\) vs \(h,b,\alpha\)) and it’s confusing”:
  - Mitigation: add a short mapping sentence and/or reuse the earlier symbol names consistently.
- “Companion note references are not acceptable for a standalone paper”:
  - Mitigation: either drop the mention entirely or change to “in separate work” without repository paths; keep all load-bearing claims in-text.
