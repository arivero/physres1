## Blackboard basis
New blackboard `2026-02-13-ito-stratonovich-refinement.md` exploring:
- Left-point (Itô) vs midpoint (Stratonovich) stochastic integrals
- Correction formula: ∫f(W)∘dW = ∫f(W)dW + ½∫f'(W)dt
- Correction arises from non-zero quadratic variation of Brownian paths
- Parallel with α-ordering: quadratic variation plays the role of ℏ

## Subagent feedback (probability theorist)
No critical errors. Important suggestions incorporated:
1. "Smooth paths" → "paths of bounded variation" (more precise)
2. Stated regularity condition f ∈ C² explicitly
3. Noted that cross-terms survive because Σ(ΔW_k)² → T ≠ 0

## Promotion (C151)
Remark 3.2 inserted after Example 3.1 in uncuttable satellite.
Satellite 103 → 112 lines (+9 net).
Reference [Oksendal2003] added.
