# S270 Debate: Is the threshold rule too model-dependent for the main paper?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\) rely on assumptions that are too narrow for a high-level review manuscript?

## Resolution
It is suitable as a scoped remark if assumptions are explicit (power-law attraction, fixed \(L\), high-momentum kinetic asymptotic). The point is organizational clarity, not a universal theorem.
