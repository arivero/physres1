# S56 Plan: Wilson Loop Area Law as an Area-Scale Supplier (\(\sigma^{-1}\))

## Goal
Write a clean study note explaining how the Wilson-loop area law implies a string tension \(\sigma\) (dimension \(\text{length}^{-2}\) in \(D=4\)), and how \(\sigma^{-1}\) could supply the "missing area scale" in the half-density scalarization program, while keeping hypothesis branches separated (fundamental input vs RG transmutation).

## Tasks
1. Record the standard definitions:
   - static potential from rectangular Wilson loops,
   - confinement area law and string tension.
2. Translate to the project’s language:
   - area-law exponentiation is an additive-action witness compatible with refinement/composition,
   - \(\sigma^{-1}\) is an area scale (in \(D=4\)) and belongs to the transmutation branch unless assumed fundamental.
3. Prepare a minimal promotion target for `C82` in `papers/planck-area/main.md` near `Remark E4a`.

## Acceptance Tests
- The note is hypothesis-separated and does not assert confinement as a universal fact.
- Uses the OA anchor `[Greensite2003Confinement]` as the reference pointer (no new bibliography yet).
