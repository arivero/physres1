# B08 Debate: How Much Bibliography Completeness Is Needed Pre-Submission?

## Question
Should Wave-1 submission require OA ingestion for every cited item (local `sources/` captures), or is metadata completeness sufficient?

## Current Resolution
For journal readiness, metadata completeness (authors/title/venue/year/pages + DOI/ISBN where available) is required.
OA ingestion is preferred but not a blocker for books/publisher PDFs; acquisition can remain `PENDING` in the ledger.
