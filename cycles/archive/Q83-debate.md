# Q83 Debate

## Hard question
Should the blackboard references (lines 77, 106) be converted to proper appendices or just removed?

## Resolution
Remove for now. The blackboards are working notes, not citable content. If the material is important enough, it should be promoted into the paper via a C cycle. For Tier 1 readiness, clean generic pointers ("see the companion notes for further dictionary items") are sufficient.
