# S134 Plan: Efimov effect as 3-body extension of contact interactions

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study the Efimov effect as the natural 3-body consequence of the 2-body contact
interaction story developed in the fermionic mediators paper (Section 5).

## Key questions
1. What is the Efimov parameter s_0 and geometric scaling factor?
2. How does the 3-body RG limit cycle differ from the 2-body fixed point?
3. What additional extension data does the 3-body sector require?
