# Q140 — Debate

## Why PASS without fixes?
All three referee issues were LOW severity and optional:
1. "i.e.\" is standard LaTeX convention, consistent with rest of paper
2. Test-particle caveat is out of scope — paper explicitly restricts to geodesic motion
3. Three-digit precision (0.707) is standard for PLB letters

No mathematical errors found. Numerical verification confirmed all formulas.
