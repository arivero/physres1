# C268 — Plan: HD-QFT Remark HD-D5.3a (derivative counterterm scaling)

Promote S233. Insert Remark HD-D5.3a after HD-D5.3: wave function
counterterm from a₁ shifts integrand to t^{1-D/2}, giving Λ^{D-4}.
Each a_n reduces by Λ². D=4: mass ∝ Λ², wave function ∝ ln Λ, rest finite.
Target: +3 lines, stay within 5pp.
