## Risks
- Harmonic oscillator error caught and corrected — promoted remark states saturation without incorrect intermediate values.
- References confirmed (Mandelstam-Tamm 1945, Pfeifer-Fröhlich 1995).
- Pauli's theorem statement is standard; rigorous version (Srinivas-Vijayalakshmi 1981) adds domain assumptions but the physics statement is correct.
