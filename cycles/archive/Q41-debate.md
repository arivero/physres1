# Q41 Debate: How Much Gauge Theory Belongs Here?

## Question
Should `papers/planck-area/main.md` include more explanation of Wilson loops/confinement, or keep the scale-supplier mention minimal?

## Current Resolution
Keep it minimal: one operational definition and one citation. Any deeper gauge-theory pedagogy belongs in a separate dependent draft (only if we pursue that branch seriously).
