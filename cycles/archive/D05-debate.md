# D05 Debate: Prioritize novelty or submission-readiness?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Given the “foundations journal” goal, should the next work unit focus on discovering new material, or on polishing the current manuscript for referee readability?

## Decision
Prioritize submission-readiness now (referee pass), then return to novelty cycles.

## Rationale
The repo already contains substantial novelty threads; the highest marginal value for “journal readiness” is clarity/structure/claim hygiene in the main paper. A referee-style pass is the fastest way to surface issues before further expansion.
