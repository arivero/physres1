# Q37 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Jargon overload**: hats and \(O(\hbar)\) scare off readers too early.
2. **False precision**: readers interpret the witness as a full theorem about path integrals.
3. **Mismatch with later text**: later sections discuss scheme dependence differently (e.g. as control maps), making the witness feel disconnected.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the witness parenthetical short and purely illustrative.
2. Keep it under `Heuristic H0.2` (explicitly non-theorem).
3. In a follow-up `S` cycle, phrase the same point using the manuscript’s "control map/equivalence" language.
