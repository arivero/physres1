# C04 Plan

## Goal
Derive the path-integral structure from composition under time slicing, with explicit assumptions and a controlled classical-limit statement.

## Scope
1. State propagator composition (semigroup) and derive time-sliced kernel product.
2. Connect multiplicative slice weights to additive discrete action and exponential form.
3. Clarify ordering/discretization ambiguity and its relation to star-product choices.
4. State stationary-phase classical recovery and connect to C03 jump/corner admissibility.

## Claims
1. Composition under slicing implies product structure over short-time kernels.
2. Under locality/additivity assumptions, path weights take exponential action form up to normalization and discretization corrections.
3. Classical trajectories emerge as stationary-phase contributions in the small-\(\hbar\) regime.

## Risks
1. Circular reasoning between canonical quantization and path integral.
2. Overstating rigorous measure construction where only formal limits are used.
3. Understating ordering ambiguities that affect subleading quantum terms.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `paper/main.md` section 6 includes explicit composition and slicing derivation.
2. Section 6 explicitly states assumptions behind exponential weighting.
3. Section 6 includes stationary-phase derivation and a formal/constructive caveat.
4. Section 6 links back to C03 piecewise-smooth extremals.
