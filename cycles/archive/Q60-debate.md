# Q60 Debate: Should "Remark" be a fourth claim type?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
R1.1 uses a `Remark R` prefix not in the taxonomy. Should we add "Remark" as a fourth claim type, or rename R1.1 to follow existing convention (parent-prefix sub-labels)?

## Options
1. Add "Remark" to taxonomy (Section 2.3) as a fourth type for non-load-bearing commentary.
2. Rename R1.1 → H1.1a, following existing sub-remark convention (D4.2b, D6.2a1).

## Current position
Option 2 is simpler. "Remark" already exists as a label word in the paper — the convention is that remarks are sub-items of their parent claim and inherit the parent prefix. Adding a fourth taxonomy entry for what is essentially a commentary convention seems like over-engineering.

## What would change my mind?
If future sections need standalone remarks that don't naturally attach to a parent claim. In that case, adding `R` to the taxonomy would be cleaner than inventing artificial parent attachments.
