# C286 — Debate

## Advocate
The formula ω_r²/ω_φ² = 3−q−v²/c² is the strongest addition available:
- Genuinely new (not in the paper in any form).
- Compact (3 lines).
- Unifying: stability, precession, and Remark 5.2c are all specializations.
- The universal −β² correction (independent of q) is a clean structural insight.
- Cross-checks perfectly against Newtonian epicyclic theory and GR (1/6 ratio).

## Skeptic
- Partially overlaps Remark 5.2c (which is the q=2 specialization).
- The effective mass subtlety (γm not γ³m) is swept under the rug in the
  remark text — could confuse readers who expect longitudinal mass.
- Adding yet another remark to Section 5.2 (now 5.2a–d) risks density overload.

## Resolution
Overlap with 5.2c is an asset, not a liability: 5.2d strictly generalizes 5.2c
to all q, and the generalization reveals the universal −β² structure invisible
at q=2 alone. The effective-mass point is a derivation detail, not needed in
the remark text (the Hamiltonian framework is standard). Four remarks in 5.2 is
acceptable given that 4.3 has seven (a–g).

**Verdict: PROMOTE.**
