# S46 Execution: "Uncuttable" Clarification

## Work Completed
- Defined "uncuttable" as a controlled-refinement notion (not indivisibility):
  - finite dissections/refinements do not determine the value,
  - a comparison/limit rule across refinements is required.
- Connected this to the repo's limit-control thesis (RCP) and the new Zeno-style motivation paragraph.
- Logged the definition and promotion target in:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-uncuttable-as-controlled-refinement.md`.

## Result
Prepared a safe promotion target: a separate dependent note `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md` that keeps historical discussion out of the PhysRev-facing core.

## Next Spawn
- `C73`: create the dependent note and promote the definition + one toy refinement example.
