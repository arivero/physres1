# C29 Debate

## Question
Is it better to fully merge D1.2a and D1.2b now, or to keep them separate until the hypothesis ladder stabilizes?

## Working Resolution
Keep them separate for now (general lemma + canonical witness) and add only a cross-pointer sentence; defer any larger compression until after `B02` (semiclassical anchor) is resolved.
