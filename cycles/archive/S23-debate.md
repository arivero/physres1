# S23 Debate: Does This Belong in the Main Paper?

## Question
Section 5.4 already includes impulse/corner jump conditions. Is a new note redundant?

## Resolution
Write the blackboard note anyway, but only promote if it adds one of:
1. a clearer “dictionary” between action-level delta terms and time-sliced amplitude insertions, or
2. a precise cautionary statement about \(\delta'\)-type defects (what is legal, what requires regularization).
