# C192 Debate: Cooper pairing promotion

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Remark completes the paper's narrative arc: obstruction (Section 3) → IR replacement (Section 4-5) → resolution via composites (Section 6).
- BEC-BCS crossover connection ties back to Remark 5.6, providing narrative closure.
- Section 6 transformed from thin placeholder to substantive conclusion.
