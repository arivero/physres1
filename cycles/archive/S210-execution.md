# S210 — Execution

## What was done
Analyzed open question #5: does RCP add to the standard anomaly-matching story?

Read uncuttable Remark 4.5, fermionic Remark 6.6, HD-QFT §7, and the
cornerstone paper (no anomaly content found).

## Key finding
RCP reframes anomalies as **composition-law defects**: a symmetry is anomalous
iff it fails to commute with the sewing/composition operation on propagators.
The half-density measure's Jacobian under the symmetry transformation IS the
anomaly, with the Fujikawa derivation providing the explicit calculation.

Three-level diagnostic:
1. Conceptual reframing: YES (anomaly = composition defect).
2. Geometric localization: PARTIAL (Fujikawa in half-density dress).
3. New constraints: NO (standard anomaly matching already complete).

## Blackboard
Overwrote slot 5 with analysis.

## Verdict
Conceptual gain only. No promotion recommended — material is honest but thin.
Updated motivations.md question #5.
