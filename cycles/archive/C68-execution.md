# C68 Execution: Promote "Newton Limit Paradox" Motivation

## Work Completed
- Added one paragraph in `paper/main.md` Introduction framing the core motivation as a Zeno-style refinement paradox:
  - refinement is an infinite-limit construction,
  - limits can fail or become scheme-dependent in singular/divergent settings,
  - quantization and renormalization are treated as limit-control mechanisms.
