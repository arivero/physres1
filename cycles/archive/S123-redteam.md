## Failure modes
Shadow Hamiltonian is a formal asymptotic series (not convergent in general). Text says "up to exponentially small corrections" which correctly captures this. The identification Verlet = symmetric Trotter is standard (Hairer-Lubich-Wanner). No new citations needed (existing [FeynmanHibbs1965] covers the context). No issues.
