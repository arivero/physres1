# S90 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Hard question
Is it worth expanding this paper at all, or should it be merged into the cornerstone?
## Resolution
Keep it separate. The "uncuttable = controlled refinement" reading is a standalone conceptual point that deserves its own note. The cornerstone already has the technical content; this paper distills the philosophical framing. Expansion (not merger) is the right move.
