# S97 Plan: Scope and skeleton for Dirac Probes satellite paper (Roadmap B)
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Draft the skeleton for satellite #9: "Dirac-Supported Probes, Corners, and Impulses."
The roadmap says: weak Euler-Lagrange + mollifier-based point-probing lemma + corner/jump conditions + one worked model.

## Key question
How much of this overlaps with existing content?
- Cornerstone Section 5 has P3.1–P3.4 (weak stationarity, mollifier localization, corners, impulses).
- Delta-objects paper has Section 3.4 (extremals in weak form) and Section 3.1b (δ' from point splitting).

## Approach
The new paper should NOT repeat existing content. Instead, it should:
1. State the mollifier-based localization as a formal theorem (with explicit hypotheses).
2. Give a worked model computation (delta-kick forcing or delta potential 1D bound state).
3. Clearly separate "Dirac-supported variation" (safe under regularity) from "delta potential" (requires renormalization).
