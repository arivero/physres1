# S209 — Plan

## Goal
Make explicit the connection between the half-density exponent d/2
(Section 2 of delta-objects) and the self-adjoint extension
classification (Remark 4.2). The heat kernel at coincidence has
singularity t^{-d/2}, and Laplace-transforming gives the Green
function singularity that controls which dimensions admit extensions.

## Scope
- Show: ∫₀^∞ t^{-d/2} e^{-κ²t} dt converges iff d < 2.
- d=1: finite → UV-finite extension parameter.
- d=2: marginal (log divergence) → dimensional transmutation.
- d≥3: power divergence → needs power-law subtraction.
- d≥4: no non-trivial extension (Morrey embedding failure).
- The critical exponent d/2=1 is the same exponent as the half-density
  normalization, connecting Sections 2 and 4.

## Acceptance tests
1. Calculation verified.
2. Remark fits naturally between Remark 4.2 and Section 5.
3. Paper stays within PLB limit.
