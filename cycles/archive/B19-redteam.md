## Failure modes

### 1. Missing stationary phase reference
- Risk: Section 3.3 uses stationary phase without a specific citation.
- Mitigation: the result is standard and follows from the formula in Section 3.2 + Gaussian integral. Hörmander [Hormander2003] covers the rigorous statement. A dedicated stationary-phase reference (e.g., Bleistein–Handelsman) could be added in a future B cycle if requested.

### 2. OA coverage
- Risk: only 1 of 4 references is OA.
- Mitigation: all 4 are standard textbooks/papers that any academic library holds. The paper is a companion note, not a journal submission requiring full OA compliance.
