# S106 Execution
Date: 2026-02-13

## Blackboard
`blackboards/2026-02-13-discretization-ordering-witness.md`: H=qp under α-discretization showing left/right/midpoint → standard/anti-standard/Weyl ordering.

## Subagent feedback (pedagogical expositor persona)
**Key findings:**
1. **Label collision**: D4.1a already taken (semigroup normalization). → Used D4.1b.
2. **Derivation gap**: Candidate text asserted the correspondence without explaining why. → Added matrix-element verification: ⟨q'|Ĥ_α|q⟩ = q_α(-iℏ)δ'(q'-q) matches kernel.
3. **False start in blackboard**: Delta-function detour was a dead end (classical, no ℏ). Normal for exploratory note.
4. **Placement**: Section 6.3 appropriate — fills the identified gap. Cross-references Section 10.2's general f(q)p family.
5. **Scratchwork residue**: Blackboard has abandoned formulas and sign-error corrections. Only the clean result promoted.
