# Q10 Redteam: Remaining Risks After C47

## Risks
1. Readers confuse \((\Phi\times\Phi)^*\) vs \((\Phi\times\Phi)_*\) in the invariance statement.
2. Lie derivatives are misread as requiring a metric connection.
3. The \(\delta'\) point-splitting reminder could be misconstrued as a claim about renormalization rather than a distributional identity.

## Mitigations
1. Use pullback notation \((\Phi\times\Phi)^*\) consistently for the “diagonal action” invariance.
2. Explicitly state “connection-free” in the draft, and reserve covariant derivatives for when a metric is fixed.
3. Keep \(\delta'\) remark as a short identity with sign fixed by pairing, linking to the S15 blackboard note for context.
