# C05 Debate

## Claim
Quantization should be framed as deformation of a classical observable algebra, not as a disconnected replacement formalism.

## Objection
This can become slogan-level unless the classical limit map is written explicitly.

## Resolution
Require an explicit \(\star_\hbar\)-product expansion and a commutator-to-Poisson recovery derivation in section 7.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Ordering ambiguity from `C04` should be encoded as equivalence among deformation products.

## Objection
Not all ordering choices are globally equivalent in every analytic setting.

## Resolution
State the equivalence claim in formal/local deformation language and avoid global overclaim.

## Status
Accepted with scope caveat.

## Claim
The deformation section should include one concrete product formula.

## Objection
A concrete formula may distract from the main narrative if it becomes too technical.

## Resolution
Use the compact Moyal representative as an anchor and keep details minimal.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
`C05` should draw a strict line between formal asymptotics and strict \(C^\ast\)-deformation results.

## Objection
Too much qualification may weaken the flow.

## Resolution
Keep one short boundary subsection: enough rigor for correctness, no long functional-analysis detour.

## Status
Accepted.
