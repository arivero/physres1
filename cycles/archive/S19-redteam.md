# S19 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. Overclaiming that the cancellation is fully metric-general rather than conformal-class.
2. Mixing the half-density operator with the standard conformal Laplacian literature without clear separation (herd trap).
3. Notational confusion between operators on scalars vs half-densities.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the “conformal rescaling” hypothesis explicit throughout.
2. If mentioning conformal Laplacian, do so only as a comparison remark, not as a driver.
3. Use a consistent notation: \(\Delta_g\) acts on scalars; \(\widetilde\Delta_g\) acts on coordinate half-density coefficients via conjugation.
