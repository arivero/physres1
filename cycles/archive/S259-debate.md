# S259 — Debate

**Question:** Is the critical-exponent-shift remark already stated clearly
enough in line 82, or does a separate remark add genuine value?

**What line 82 currently says:**
> "Structurally, SR lowers the Newtonian critical exponent from q_crit = 3
>  to q_crit = 2: the inverse-square force is the unique power law where
>  the bound is non-trivial."

This states the *fact* (3 → 2) and the *consequence* (q = 2 is the unique
non-trivial case), but it does not state the *mechanism*: why exactly 1,
and what kinematic principle drives the shift.

**What the draft remark adds:**
1. The causal chain: E = p²/(2m) → barrier ~ 1/r² → q_crit = 3; then
   E ≈ pc → barrier ~ 1/r → q_crit = 2. The drop of 1 in the exponent
   is traced to the drop of 1 in the degree of the energy-momentum relation.
2. A connection to the paper's core theme: the shift is a "refinement witness"
   in the precise sense that it reflects the kinematic upgrade from Galilean
   to Lorentzian energy-momentum structure.
3. A conceptual bridge to Section 5's stability analysis, where q = 2 again
   emerges as a critical boundary — but from the second-derivative (stability)
   condition rather than the zeroth-order (barrier existence) condition. The
   remark makes explicit that both sections detect the same underlying change
   in the energy-momentum relation.

**Counterargument:** A reader who sees W_L ≈ Lc/r on line 77 and W_NR ~ L²/(2mr²)
from standard textbooks can reconstruct the shift without help. The remark
might be pedagogically useful but not structurally necessary.

**Resolution:** The remark is worth including because:
- The paper's thesis is that kinematic refinements (Newton → SR → GR) produce
  observable structural changes. The q_crit shift is one of the sharpest
  examples, and leaving its mechanism implicit undercuts the thesis.
- The "degree of homogeneity" explanation is one sentence and connects two
  otherwise separate sections (3.1 and 5.2).
- It costs ~3 sentences and does not add formalism; it only interprets
  existing displayed equations.

The paper currently explains *what* the shift is. The remark explains *why*.
For a paper about structural witnesses, the "why" matters.
