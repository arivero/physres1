# Q47 Plan: Referee Pass on Action–Angle Dependent Note

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C89`: dependent note `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md`

## Goal
Referee-pass `C89` for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience (foundations-journal tone).

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q47-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: “witness” vs “outlook” clearly separated; no force-range claims.
- Angle-operator hygiene: no dependence on disputed self-adjoint \(\phi\) operator.
- Notation: \(m\in\mathbb Z\), periodicity, and “uniform in \(\phi\)” phrasing are unambiguous.
- Citations: the \(e^{im\phi}\) separation anchor is present; no transcript leakage.
- Reader flow: abstract + Section 1 make clear what is proven vs merely interpreted.

## Acceptance criteria
- A concrete list of edits to do next, expressed as spawned `S/B/C/D` cycles (not direct edits).
