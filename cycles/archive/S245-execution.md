# S245 — Execution
Found the Casimir effect is already covered in:
- fermionic mediators Remark 5.7 (boundary-condition force, experimental verification)
- uncuttable Remark 2.7 (zeta-function regularization, ζ(-1)=-1/12, bosonic string d=26)
Adding a Casimir remark to HD-QFT would duplicate existing content.
Decision: no promotion. HD-QFT stays at 265 lines.
