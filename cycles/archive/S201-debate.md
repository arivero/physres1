# S201 — Debate

## Key decisions
1. Appelquist-Carazzone is the right framing because it elevates the contact
   expansion from a mathematical trick to a physical theorem.
2. Universality point is crucial: it connects to the paper's theme that
   contact data is what survives at low resolution, not the UV details.
3. The matching language (Wilson coefficients, UV → IR) connects naturally
   to Weinberg's power counting in Remark 4.4.
