# S52 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Coverage map rot**: map becomes outdated again as cycles proceed.
2. **Overexpansion**: too many dependent drafts without multi-wave substance.
3. **Transcript creep**: importing conversation phrasing instead of derivation-first restatement.

## Mitigations
1. Update `docs/conv-coverage-map.md` whenever a new dependent draft is created or a major promotion happens.
2. Require at least one follow-up wave (`Q` or `C`) before considering a new draft "real".
3. Keep `conv_patched.md` as idea log only; rewrite everything in our own claim-taxonomy language.
