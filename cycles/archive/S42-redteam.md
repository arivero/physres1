# S42 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overreach into QFT machinery:** kernel-level doubling is presented as "explaining" Schwinger-Keldysh rather than matching its structure.
2. **Bibliography debt:** naming formalism without anchors becomes load-bearing.
3. **Notational bloat:** doubled-space remark disrupts the current focused scope of `half-density-qft`.

## Mitigations
1. Promote only the kernel identity and its immediate interpretation.
2. Keep any formalism name as optional aside; queue a `B` cycle if expanded.
3. Insert as one compact remark in the most relevant section (propagators/kernels), not as a new long section.
