# S187 Redteam: QND Measurement Blackboard

## Coverage
Quantum optics experimentalist persona reviewed blackboard cold, identified 9 issues across rigor/pedagogy/correctness tiers.

## All HIGH and MEDIUM Issues Resolved
- Dual QND commutator conditions ([A, H_sys]=0 AND [A, H_int]=0) now explicit and justified.
- Back-action correctly reframed as conjugate-variable redistribution, not absence.
- Cavity-QED experimental details (Rydberg, Ramsey, dispersive coupling) added with Nogues reference.
- Zeno and QND clearly separated in conceptual taxonomy.

## Residual LOW Issues
3 LOW items (decoherence contrast depth, experimental timeline, reference completeness) are context-dependent and do not block promotion. Addressed via minor edits.

## Physics Soundness
No unresolved technical errors. Blackboard is accurate and ready for Remark 5.7 insertion.

## Next Step
Proceed to C228 (Remark 5.7 promotion).
