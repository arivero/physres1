# S45 Execution: String-Tension Scale Supplier Branch

## Work Completed
- Distinguished two roles for "string tension supplies an area scale":
  1. a fundamental UV area parameter \(\alpha_\ast\) (Example E4 / H2.12 branch),
  2. an emergent confining string tension \(\sigma\) giving \(\alpha_{\rm eff}=\sigma^{-1}\) (transmutation branch).
- Noted that in \(d=4\) gauge theories with dimensionless coupling, \(\sigma\) must be RG-generated (dimensional transmutation), so it belongs logically with H2.13 rather than H2.5.
- Logged the separation and promotion candidate in:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-string-tension-as-area-scale-branch.md`.

## Result
Prepared a concise clarification to insert near Example E4 / H2.13 in `papers/planck-area/main.md`.

## Next Spawn
- `C72`: promote one short remark clarifying the two meanings and their hypothesis-branch placement.
