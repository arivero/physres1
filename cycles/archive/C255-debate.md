## Placement rationale
- Remark 4.3b follows 4.3a naturally: 4.3a = qualitative (ISCO exists/doesn't), 4.3b = quantitative (minimum L value).
- Example 5.2b follows Remark 5.2a: the Remark classifies regimes abstractly, the Example gives concrete numbers.

## Line budget
+11 lines keeps the paper comfortably at 4pp (4670 tok), well within PLB 6pp limit.
