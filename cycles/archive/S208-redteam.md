## Failure mode 1: Trivial example
The Padé [0/1] of a geometric series is trivial. A referee might
not consider this "non-perturbative."

**Mitigation**: The example is pedagogical, not claimed as a new
result. Its value is as a concrete anchor for the structural claim
(contact data encodes UV physics). The loop-level extension
(branch cuts, Borel) is the genuinely non-trivial target.

## Failure mode 2: Over-claiming about Borel–Padé
The loop-level discussion is structural but uncomputed. If cited
in a paper, it would need explicit verification.

**Mitigation**: Correctly labeled as "structural but unworked."
The blackboard proposes concrete follow-ups, not claims.

## Failure mode 3: Padé convergence claims
Montessus de Ballore applies to meromorphic functions with isolated
poles, not to functions with dense branch cuts. The claim that
Padé poles "accumulate on the cut" is true but convergence is
much weaker than for poles.

**Mitigation**: Acknowledged in the blackboard: "convergence is
logarithmic in N." Could be made more precise if promoted.
