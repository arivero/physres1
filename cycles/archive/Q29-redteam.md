# Q29 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Scope leakage:** readers overextend the 3D one-parameter statement to broader interaction classes.
2. **Bridge repetition:** too many short heuristics in Section 5.8 reduce momentum.
3. **Narrative skew:** contact-case discussion overshadows non-contact RG arguments.

## Mitigations
1. Keep explicit s-wave branch qualifier.
2. Avoid adding more micro-remarks unless they resolve concrete ambiguities.
3. Use next study cycle to surface non-contact unresolved themes from `conv_patched.md`.
