# C183 Debate: Wilson RG Remark 4.1

Date: 2026-02-13

## Decisions
- Placed in Section 4 (Outlook), expanding the "renormalization" bullet.
- Stayed at conceptual level per reviewer recommendation — matches paper's "small conceptual bridge" register.
- Softened fixed-point claim: physical QFT is a relevant deformation, not the fixed point itself.
