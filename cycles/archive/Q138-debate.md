# Q138 — Debate: Referee review of C253

## Q: Was Issue #2 really HIGH?
**A:** Borderline — the integral and its scaling were correct, but the physical
interpretation was ambiguous. In a PLB paper, physics readers would notice
the UV/IR confusion. Elevating to HIGH was appropriate.

## Q: Should Issue #4 (D=2 log) have been fixed?
**A:** No. The paper operates in general D with physical interest in D=4.
The D=2 edge case is standard and the "for D>2" qualifier covers it.
