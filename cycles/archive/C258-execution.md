# C258 — Execution: Promote S223 into dirac-probes

## Changes
1. **Remark 3.1b** (W-E second condition) — inserted after Theorem 3.1 proof
   - [H]_{t₀⁻}^{t₀⁺} = 0 with display equation
   - Notes relation to energy conservation for autonomous L
   - +7 lines

2. **Remark 4.3a** (Midpoint kick maximizes action excess) — inserted after §4.3
   - t₀(T-t₀)/T maximized at T/2, value T/4
   - Physical interpretation
   - +3 lines

## Result
- Paper: 212 → 222 lines (+10), 5pp (5486 tok)
- Within PLB ≤6pp limit
