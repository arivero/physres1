## Failure modes
### 1. Missed issues
- Risk: the sweep checked only 4 categories. Other issues (e.g., inconsistent notation across papers) may exist.
- Mitigation: notation consistency is a harder problem requiring semantic review, not grep. A future DX cycle could address cross-paper notation if needed.
