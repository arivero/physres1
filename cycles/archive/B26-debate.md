# B26 Debate: Hamilton 1834 Transcription

## Should we retry the transcription?

**Pro:** Having a committed transcription of key equations would be valuable
for future reference and avoids re-reading the 62-page PDF each session.

**Con:** The content filter may trigger again. The key findings are already
captured in B26-execution.md and the citation annotation is correct.
Manual selective transcription (just the key equations, not full sections)
might succeed where full-page transcription failed.

**Decision:** Defer. The essential information (V vs S distinction, equation 14,
HJ-PDE) is documented. A future session can attempt selective transcription
of just the key equations if needed.

## Is the Hamilton 1834 citation accurate?

Yes. The annotation in delta-objects line 192 now reads:
"the mixed Hessian ∂²S/∂q∂Q appears here a century before Van Vleck takes
its determinant for the semiclassical propagator prefactor"

This is historically correct: Hamilton's 1834 paper has the mixed Hessian
structure (equation 14 for V), and Van Vleck's 1928 paper takes its
determinant for the WKB prefactor.
