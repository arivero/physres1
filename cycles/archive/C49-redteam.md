# C49 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim:** suggesting the generic-\(q\) witness *proves* the half-density area-scale hypothesis.
2. **Dimension confusion:** mixing spatial dimension \(n\) and spacetime dimension \(D\), or using the 4D Planck-length identity without marking it.
3. **Undocumented exception:** forgetting the \(n=2\) logarithmic Green function caveat.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the remark framed as a witness/compatibility check, not a theorem of the half-density ladder.
2. Mark the step where \(D=4\) enters explicitly (the Planck identity).
3. Mention the \(n=2\) exception in one parenthetical.
