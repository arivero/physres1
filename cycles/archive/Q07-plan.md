# Q07 Plan

## Goal
Referee-style pass on `papers/planck-area/main.md` around the H2.5/H2.7 ladder and the example sieve blocks (gravity-only, \(\Lambda\), Yang–Mills, \(\alpha'\)) to ensure:
1. hypotheses/knobs are cleanly separated,
2. the “gravity-only ⇒ \(D=4\)” claim is stated with the right scope,
3. the \(\alpha'\) example is framed as an admissibility variant (not a dynamics claim).

## Scope
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md` (read-only in this cycle).
2. Record findings/action items in `cycles/Q07-execution.md`.
3. Update `cycles/index.md` and `docs/research-log.md` to record completion.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `cycles/Q07-execution.md` lists actionable edits tagged by cycle type.
2. No manuscript edits performed in this cycle.
