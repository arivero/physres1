# S53 Debate: Put Dimension-Selection in the Main Paper or Keep It in the Planck-Area Follow-up?

## Question
Should the "only \(n=3\) yields linear Compton scaling under fixed areal speed" statement be promoted into `paper/main.md`, or remain in `papers/planck-area/main.md`?

## Current Resolution
Keep it in the Planck-area follow-up for now. The cornerstone manuscript already has the refinement-obstruction spine; the dimension-selection consequence is a dependent hypothesis branch that should not distract the core narrative unless it becomes load-bearing.
