# Q22 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Section bloat:** too many sub-remarks reduce readability.
2. **Assumption leakage:** non-planar caveat read as full non-planar framework.
3. **Progress stall:** repeated polishing without new external anchors.

## Mitigations
1. Keep D1.5h short and mathematically tight.
2. Preserve explicit cautionary wording.
3. Continue with S34 observable-link study next.
