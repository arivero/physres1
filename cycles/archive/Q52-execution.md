# Q52 Execution: Referee pass on C95 reader-map clarifications

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C95`

## Findings
- The reader map now explicitly points to Appendix 10.3 for symbol definitions, which addresses the only plausible early-symbol friction without adding extra prose.
- The Future Work bullet is now accurate: it frames the navigation diagram as an optional upgrade, consistent with the presence of the compact reader map.
- No new technical claims, citations, or scope expansion were introduced.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- None required.

## Optional follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- None.
