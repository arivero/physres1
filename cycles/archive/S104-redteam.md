## Failure modes
1. The "intuitive physicist" persona produced weaker mathematical checks than the "skeptical mathematician" persona (no arithmetic verification, more qualitative). Good for physical insight, less good for catching typos. Consider mixing personas.
2. The satellite paper now has both circular-orbit and bound-orbit sections for q=2 only. The general-q effective-potential analysis (Section 5) already covers stability — there may be redundancy. Mitigation: Section 3.1 is specifically about existence of bound orbits, not stability.
