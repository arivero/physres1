## Failure Modes to Watch
1. Adding incorrect bibliographic metadata (wrong year/title/DOI).
2. Over-citing or making the narrative literature-led instead of compatibility-led.
3. Treating preprints or internal notes as “validation” rather than idea guides.

## Mitigations
- Use INSPIRE/arXiv/journal metadata as the source of truth for keys and identifiers.
- Keep new citations minimal and load-bearing; avoid citation dumps.
- If an item is not OA-accessible here, mark it `PENDING` with explicit next actions.
