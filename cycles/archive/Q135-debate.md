# Q135 Debate: Referee Review of C249

## Key judgement calls

### "metalinear bundle" vs "half-density bundle"
The red-team flagged "metalinear bundle" as defensible but risky jargon. Three options:
- A: Replace entirely → loses precision
- B: Keep with footnote → adds length
- C: Replace with "half-density bundle on L" → preserves meaning, accessible

**Decision:** Option C. "Half-density bundle on L" is both precise and standard in the semiclassical literature (Bates-Weinstein, Hörmander). The metalinear/metaplectic connection is already implicit in the surrounding text about Mp(2n).

### Hamilton annotation strength
Original: "is the Van Vleck determinant a century later" — implies Hamilton defined the determinant.
Fixed: "appears here a century before Van Vleck takes its determinant" — credits the matrix (Hessian) to Hamilton, the determinant step to Van Vleck.

### "Algebraically counting" vs "counting"
Red-team noted the Maslov index is technically an algebraic (signed) count. For a parenthetical remark, the informal "counting" is acceptable. Would change only if upgrading to a full subsection.
