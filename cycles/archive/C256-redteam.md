## Potential issues
1. The bound-state condition κ=α is stated without derivation. Consistent with paper style (Example 4.1 derives the 1D case in detail; the 2D case is classified in Remark 4.2).
2. "Pole of the T-matrix" — the paper uses resolvent language (Example 4.1), not T-matrix. But T-matrix is standard terminology for scattering theory. Minor inconsistency.
3. "RG-invariant length scale α^{-1}" — technically α is the RG-invariant; 1/α is the derived length. Acceptable shorthand.
