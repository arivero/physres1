# S91 Debate

## Hard question
Why was the cornerstone listed as ~2200 lines when it's actually 1435?
## Resolution
The ~2200 figure was likely from an earlier version or included the .tex rendering. The .md source is 1435 lines. The .tex file (generated by pandoc) is typically longer due to LaTeX boilerplate, but what matters for the ledger is the source.
