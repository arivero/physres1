# C84 Execution: Add a Newton-Limit Paradox Witness Tied to \(\hbar\)

## Work
- Added `Derivation D4.2a` in `paper/main.md` (Section 6.4) giving a finite-dimensional "soft extremum" witness:
  \(-\hbar\log\int e^{-S/\hbar}\) composes under refinement and tends to the hard extremum as \(\hbar\to0\).

## Result
The manuscript now has an explicit mathematical obstruction-to-primitive argument:
"take the extremum" is not the stable operation under refinement-composition; it is a limit of a composing object controlled by \(\hbar\).
