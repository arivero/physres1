# S264 — Debate

## Central question
Which 1-2 missing references would a referee most likely flag as absent from the relativistic central orbits satellite paper?

## Position 1: Sommerfeld 1916 is the only essential addition
**Argument:** The paper's key SR result — the orbit equation u'' + omega^2 u = const with omega^2 = 1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2) — is Sommerfeld's 1916 result, one of the most famous in early relativistic physics. Not citing it would be like presenting E=mc^2 without citing Einstein. The v=K/L identity, the L>K/c bound, and the precessing-ellipse orbit are all either explicit in or directly implied by Sommerfeld's analysis. Every other candidate reference is either redundant (Weinberg, Wald duplicate Carroll's role), out of scope (Kramers/old quantum theory), or merely a "nice to have" textbook (Goldstein).

**Counterargument:** The paper frames its analysis as a refinement-witness exercise rather than as a historical survey. Sommerfeld's context was the hydrogen atom; the paper's context is general power-law forces. The paper already cites Boscaggin et al. who work with the same SR Kepler equation in a modern mathematical framework. A referee might accept Boscaggin et al. as sufficient.

**Response:** Boscaggin et al. is a 2020 dynamical-systems paper, not the historical source of the equation. A referee would still expect the originator to be cited, especially since the 1/6 precession ratio has a famous history (it was known before GR as the SR contribution to Mercury's perihelion advance). Sommerfeld's omission is qualitatively different from omitting, say, Goldstein.

## Position 2: Bertrand 1873 should be added alongside Sommerfeld
**Argument:** Remark 3.2a explicitly names "Bertrand's theorem" and analyzes how SR violates it. The paper discusses closure of orbits and the reduction of closed-orbit power laws from a theorem about all inverse-square and Hooke orbits to a measure-zero subset. Citing the original theorem is natural and minimal. It is a 4-page paper in Comptes Rendus, universally accessible, and the citation cost is negligible.

**Counterargument:** Bertrand's theorem is so widely known that many physics papers treat it as common knowledge, citing only textbooks (or nothing) when invoking it. Adding a citation to an 1873 French paper is arguably more pedantic than helpful.

**Response:** The paper's style already includes foundational citations (Newton 1687, Berkeley 1734 in the cornerstone). Citing Bertrand 1873 is consistent with this style and demonstrates scholarly care. For a PLB-format letter, one line of citation text is negligible overhead.

## Position 3: Goldstein should replace Bertrand
**Argument:** A modern textbook reference (Goldstein Ch. 3) would be more useful to readers than an 1873 French-language paper. Goldstein covers Bertrand's theorem, orbit stability, and precession in a single standard reference.

**Counterargument:** The paper does not follow Goldstein's treatment. Its derivations are self-contained. Adding Goldstein as a "general background" reference is less targeted than citing Sommerfeld (for the specific orbit equation) and Bertrand (for the specific theorem named). Also, citing a textbook for results you derive independently can read as under-confident. The paper already has Carroll as its textbook-level anchor for GR.

## Resolution
**Primary addition:** Sommerfeld 1916 — essential, no reasonable case against it.
**Secondary addition:** Bertrand 1873 — appropriate and consistent with the paper's citation style, low cost. Preferred over Goldstein because the paper explicitly names the theorem.
**Not added:** Weinberg, Wald (redundant with Carroll), Goldstein (unnecessary given self-contained derivations), Kramers/old quantum theory (out of scope).
