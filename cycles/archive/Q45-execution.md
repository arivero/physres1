# Q45 Execution: Referee Pass on `C87`

Date: 2026-02-10

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C87`

## Findings
- Claim hygiene is acceptable: the note limits itself to the failure of the *classical commuting-source* transplant, and explicitly acknowledges loop/composite/EFT routes.
- The Grassmann-source statement is explicitly anchored by `[Floerchinger2024QFT1Lecture21]`.
- The contact matching witness is concise and derivation-first; overall prefactors are clearly treated as convention-dependent.

## Suggested follow-ups (optional)
- `B10` (optional): add a second independent OA anchor for the fermionic generating functional (in case a referee dislikes lecture-page citations).
- `C88` (optional): add one short sentence clarifying the signature/convention (Euclidean vs Minkowski) in the bosonic Gaussian-elimination sketch.

## Spawned cycles
- None required to keep this note coherent; proceed unless a referee demands additional anchoring.
