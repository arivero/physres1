# Q23 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Checklist fatigue:** too many guardrail remarks reduce narrative flow.
2. **Ambiguous reconstruction:** readers may ask what concrete data pipeline is assumed.
3. **Over-confidence:** operational equations misread as validated phenomenology.

## Mitigations
1. Keep D1.5i concise and equation-first.
2. Queue S35 for a concrete reconstruction pipeline sketch.
3. Retain branch-scoped language and no empirical overclaim.
