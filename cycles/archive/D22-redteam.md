# D22 Redteam

Date: 2026-02-14

## Risks
1. Creating artificial links that are rhetorically attractive but technically weak.
2. Diluting active high-priority threads with speculative side links.

## Mitigations
1. Require one concrete insertion candidate with non-handwavy logic.
2. Drop the link if it cannot be stated in <=2 sentences.

## Iteration 2 addendum
3. Any cross-link insertion must explicitly state non-load-bearing scope to avoid artificial architectural coupling.

## Iteration 3 addendum
4. Risk: novelty-rich wording can create implicit new claims.
5. Mitigation: enforce bounded novelty window and retain explicit non-load-bearing phrasing.

## Re-anchor addendum
6. Risk: turning conceptual triage into prose-placement policy.
7. Mitigation: require a novelty statement/counterexample to continue D22.

## Closure addendum
8. Risk: continuing without novelty signal converts D22 into process churn.
9. Mitigation: close when no new conceptual relation is evidenced.
