# Q50 Debate: Is `[TongQMLectures]` the right kind of anchor for a foundations journal?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Should the main paper cite lecture notes for the \(e^{im\phi}\) separation-of-variables statement, or should it avoid citing anything for such standard material?

## Recommendation
Keep the single lecture-note anchor as lightweight attribution, since the statement is not load-bearing for the core thesis and the derivation is explicit. If a later referee demands a textbook/journal anchor, swap the citation in a future `B`+`C` wave.
