# Q184 Plan: Referee pass on C302 (Remark D4.1c, symmetry selects midpoint)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle
- `C302`

## Review scope
1. Mathematical correctness of the symmetry-defect formula.
2. Notation consistency with D4.1b and Section 6.
3. Whether the logical chain (unitarity -> self-adjointness -> symmetry) is stated correctly.
4. Whether the domain discussion (R_+ vs R) is accurate.
5. Overstated claims or missing caveats.
6. Claim hygiene: no overstatement beyond remark-level scope.

## Acceptance criteria
- PASS if the statement is mathematically correct at declared scope, notation is consistent, and no regressions are introduced.
- PASS WITH MINOR REVISIONS if there are small issues (wording, missing citation) that do not affect correctness.
- MAJOR REVISIONS REQUIRED if there is a mathematical error, a misleading claim, or a structural problem.
