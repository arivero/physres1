# S246 — Execution
Verified the structural parallel between:
- Classical impulse (Thm 3.2): p(t₀⁺) - p(t₀⁻) = J (external forcing)
- Quantum 1D delta potential: ψ'(0⁺) - ψ'(0⁻) = (2mg/ℏ²)ψ(0) (self-adjoint extension)

Key finding: same integration-across-discontinuity argument, but the quantum
"impulse" (2mg/ℏ²)ψ(0) is proportional to the wavefunction at the interaction
point — a self-consistent boundary condition rather than external forcing.
This bridges Sections 3.2 (classical impulses) and 5.2 (delta potentials).
Decision: promote as Remark 5.2a after Example 5.2a (line 221).
