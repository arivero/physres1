# C116 Plan: Promote S78 Van Vleck × transmutation kernel-level separation

Date: 2026-02-12

## Source
- `S78`: Van Vleck prefactor × transmutation scale — structural separation in 2D delta
- Blackboard: `blackboards/2026-02-12-van-vleck-transmutation-2d-delta.md`

## Goal
Add a remark (PA-E5b) to the Planck-area draft after PA-E5a, stating where in the 2D delta kernel the transmutation scale acts relative to the Van Vleck half-density prefactor.

## Key content to promote
- Lippmann–Schwinger factorization: G = G₀ + G₀·T·G₀
- G₀ factors carry Van Vleck half-density weight (geometric, PA-D1.4)
- T(E) is a scalar at the vertex containing κ* (dynamical, PA-H2.13)
- They are structurally independent, combine multiplicatively
- Van Vleck = transformation law (PA-H2.1); κ* = scalarization constant (PA-H2.2–H2.4)

## Allowed files
- `papers/planck-area/main.md`

## Expected output
- 1 new remark (PA-E5b), ~3–5 lines
- Diffstat: small positive
