# C269 — Plan: Dirac-probes Remark 4.4a (Noether charges across impulses)

Promote S234. Insert Remark 4.4a after Section 4.4 paragraph, before
Section 4.5. General Noether criterion: ΔQ = J·ξ(q(t₀)), so charge
conserved iff J⊥ξ. Section 4.4 angular momentum is special case.
Target: +3 lines, stay within 5pp.
