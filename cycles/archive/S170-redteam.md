## Verification checklist

1. **IR renormalons on positive Borel axis** — Confirmed. IR renormalons
   encode power corrections $\sim (\Lambda/Q)^{2n}$ and sit at
   $t = 2n/\beta_0 > 0$. UV renormalons are on the negative axis.
   ✓ Corrected in blackboard.

2. **Sign factor removed** — The spurious $(-1)^n$ in the large-order
   formula was a transcription error. The correct Bender–Wu relation
   has no alternating sign for the ground-state quartic oscillator.
   ✓ Removed.

3. **Growth rate clarified as $A^{-n}$** — The blackboard now states
   $a_n \sim A^{-n}\,\Gamma(n+b)\,(1 + O(1/n))$ with $A$ identified
   as the instanton action, not merely "$n!$ growth."
   ✓ Corrected.

4. **Both Bender–Wu papers cited** — BW 1969 (Phys Rev 184, 1231) for
   the original large-order relation; BW 1973 (Phys Rev D 7, 1620) for
   logarithmic corrections and the full trans-series structure.
   ✓ Both now referenced.

No residual issues found.
