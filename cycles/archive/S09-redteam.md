## Failure Modes
1. Confusing the canonical half-density delta with a “square root of a scalar delta”.
2. Overclaiming “RG fixes scalarization” as a theorem rather than as a conditional identification.
3. Writing the note without any concrete computation (it must show the scaling exponents explicitly).

## Mitigations
- Use operator/kernel statements throughout.
- Keep the RG identification explicitly “if one insists on dimensionless scalar representatives + background-free constancy”.
- Include the explicit dilation scaling of \(\delta(x)|dx|^{1/2}\).
