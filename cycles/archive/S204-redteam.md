## Failure mode 1: Leading-order only
The V = (1/6)R result is at leading curvature order. Higher-order terms
(a₂: R², R_μν R^μν, □R) are D-dependent and may spoil the matching.

**Mitigation**: The leading-order matching is still a necessary condition.
If the matching fails at leading order, it certainly fails at higher orders.
State the result as "necessary, not sufficient" for D=4.

## Failure mode 2: Conformal coupling not forced
If conformal coupling ξ = 1/6 is not independently motivated, the
matching V = ξ_conf is a tautology dressed as a result. The "selection"
would be selecting for a coupling constant, not a dimension.

**Mitigation**: Present the result as conditional: "IF conformal coupling
is required (e.g., by UV scale invariance), THEN D=4 is selected." Do not
claim D=4 is selected unconditionally.

## Failure mode 3: Tension with HD-D1.3a
The existing Remark HD-D1.3a says the D=4 cancellation is
"conformal-class-specific." Promoting a remark that says "general metric"
without updating HD-D1.3a creates a contradiction.

**Mitigation**: When promoting (C cycle), update HD-D1.3a to clarify that
its "conformal-class-specific" caveat applies to the gradient-correction
structure, not to the leading-order coefficient. The two statements are
compatible but need explicit reconciliation.

## Failure mode 4: Overclaiming novelty
The connection between a₁ = (1/6 − ξ)R and conformal coupling in D=4
is textbook material (DeWitt, Birrell-Davies, Vassilevich). The
"normal-coordinate V = (1/6)R" computation is essentially the same
fact repackaged.

**Mitigation**: Frame the remark as making the half-density origin of
(1/6)R explicit — not as discovering a new mathematical fact, but as
connecting a known fact to the half-density program.
