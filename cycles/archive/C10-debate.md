# C10 Debate

## Claim
The continuation should end with a foundational compatibility postulate, not a strict-deformation appendix.

## Objection
Foundational framing can read as philosophical rather than technical.

## Resolution
Bind every postulate component to existing equations from `C01`--`C06` and keep it as a synthesis layer.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
The new foundational concept should coexist with pending bibliography items.

## Objection
Pending references might weaken confidence in synthesis claims.

## Resolution
Proceed with explicit pending-status transparency and limit claims to already-ingested or standard-source-supported content.

## Status
Accepted.
