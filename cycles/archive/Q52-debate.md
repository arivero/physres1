# Q52 Debate: Does the reader map need a stronger “symbols defined later” cue?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Is “Symbol definitions and formal summary: Appendix 10.3.” sufficient to prevent notation friction for readers who encounter \(\mathcal C_t,\mathcal Q_\hbar,\mathcal R_\Lambda\) for the first time in Section 2.5?

## Recommendation
Yes: the cue is minimal and explicit, and the block is framed as navigation, not as a technical definition.
