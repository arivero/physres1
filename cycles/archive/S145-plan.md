# S145 Plan: Feshbach resonances as tunable contact interactions

Date: 2026-02-13

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/fermionic-mediators-contact-limits/main.md` (potential)

## Scope
Study Feshbach resonances as the laboratory mechanism for tuning the scattering length through ±∞, realizing the contact-coupling RG flow experimentally. Magnetic field sweeps through the unitarity fixed point (BEC-BCS crossover). Blackboard slot 0.
