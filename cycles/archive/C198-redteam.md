# C198 Red Team: Promote conformal symmetry remark

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Conformal group corrected from SO(d,2) to SO(d+1,1) for Euclidean signature.
- Scale→conformal stated precisely: proven in d=2, avoided overclaiming for d=4.
- References: Zamolodchikov 1986, Komargodski-Schwimmer 2011 cited by name — need formal entries in B cycle.
