# D19 Plan: Organize slow-cadence cycle queue for threshold thread

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Define a slower, research-first cycle queue with explicit alternation and checkpoints before any new manuscript edit.

## Queue design principles
1. Keep study-heavy cadence (S-rich) before next C.
2. Require objection-response evidence in every S execution log.
3. Use one D checkpoint after every two S cycles.

## Proposed queue
- Completed in this pass: `D18 -> S272 -> S273`.
- Next recommended queue (no commit yet):
  1. `D19` (this organizer cycle),
  2. `S274` (derive coefficient-sensitive marginal condition with explicit parameter map),
  3. `S275` (derive minimal manuscript sentence from safe/unsafe split),
  4. optional `C300` only if sentence materially improves `Remark P1.1a`.

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/D19-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Queue and promotion gate are explicit.
- No manuscript edits.
