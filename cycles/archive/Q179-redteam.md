# Q179 Red Team: Referee attacks on C296

Date: 2026-02-14

## Likely referee objections
- "Extension family shown is only one slice of the full parameter space."
  - Mitigation: already stated as witness-level in `D9.1g`.
- "Need stronger bridge to RCP formalism section."
  - Mitigation: optional C297 adds an explicit cross-reference sentence around `D10.1a`.
