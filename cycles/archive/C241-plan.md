# C241 — Plan

## Goal
Promotion wave: insert two reviewed blackboard remarks into the fermionic
mediators paper as Remark 2.3 and Remark 4.6.

## Scope
- Remark 2.3 (Born approximation bridge): from blackboard 0, after Remark 2.2
- Remark 4.6 (Heavy-mediator decoupling): from blackboard 1, after Remark 4.5
- Add Appelquist-Carazzone 1975 reference
- Both remarks bridge Section 2 (bosonic exchange) to Section 4 (contact expansion)
