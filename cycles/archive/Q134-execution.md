# Q134 — Execution

## Verdict: PASS

All claims verified correct:
- Identity-kernel scaling ε^{-d/2} (Section 2): confirmed from explicit computation.
- Heat-kernel convergence d<2 (Remark 4.3): confirmed (Γ(1-d/2) pole at d=2).
- Sobolev embedding H^k → C^0 iff k > d/2: correct standard result. For k=2: d<4, i.e., d≤3.
- Synthesis claim ("one geometric fact"): defensible — all three are manifestations of the half-density weight.

Integration smooth. Forward/backward references all correct.

No fixes needed. Two optional minor suggestions (not applied):
1. Add "(continuous embedding)" for extra precision.
2. Soften "one geometric fact" to "a single underlying geometric structure."
