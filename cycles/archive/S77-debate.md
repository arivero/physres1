# S77 Debate: Is the nested hierarchy (semigroup ⊃ transmutation ⊃ sieve) a useful organizing principle?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
S76 and S77 together suggest a three-level hierarchy of RG structure. Is this hierarchy genuinely useful for the project, or is it just a restatement of "different beta functions do different things"?

## Working answer
The hierarchy is useful because it maps cleanly onto the project's existing witnesses:
- Level 1 (semigroup): D6.2a-sg in the main paper — simplest instance, no new scale.
- Level 2 (transmutation): Section 10.5 / PA-E5 — nonlinear beta, new scale, no dimension selection.
- Level 3 (dimension sieve): PA-D1.3 — monomial coupling dependence, d = 4 selected.

Each level adds a structural demand beyond the previous. This is not a restatement of "different betas"; it's a classification of what *type* of physical conclusion follows from what *structural property* of the beta function.

## Next check
A formal statement of the hierarchy as a proposition (or heuristic) in the Planck-area draft could make the structure explicit. But this is optional — the three witnesses already demonstrate the hierarchy by example.
