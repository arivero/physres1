# C63 Debate: Too Statistical for Current Draft?

## Question
Does adding covariance/Jacobian language overcomplicate the foundations-focused narrative?

## Current Resolution
Keep it minimal:
- one compact baseline formula pair,
- one sentence on nonlinear cross-check when needed,
- no full statistical machinery in main text.
