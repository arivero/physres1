# B07 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Too lattice-centric**: references emphasize lattice formalism more than the conceptual Wilson-loop criterion.
2. **Weak anchoring**: missing a statement of the static-potential definition via rectangular loops.
3. **OA fragility**: chosen OA source disappears or is not stable.

## Mitigations
1. Prefer review sources that explicitly present the Wilson-loop potential definition and the area-law criterion.
2. Add a second OA reference later if needed (lecture notes) to diversify anchors.
3. Keep arXiv IDs in the ledger to ensure stable access.
