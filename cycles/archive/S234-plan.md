# S234 — Plan: Noether charge conservation across impulses

Study the general Noether theorem for piecewise-smooth trajectories with
delta-function forcing. Key result: across an impulse J·δ(t-t₀), the
change in the Noether charge Q = (∂L/∂q̇)·ξ is ΔQ = J·ξ(q(t₀)). So Q
is conserved iff J⊥ξ (impulse orthogonal to symmetry generator). Section
4.4 is the angular-momentum special case.
