# S54 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Not physics-looking**: readers dislike numerical-analysis examples.
2. **Overreach**: claiming the toy \(\tau\) fixed point proves RG uniqueness.
3. **Notation clash**: mixing the ODE step size \(h\) with the manuscript’s other uses of \(h\) as resolution.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the promoted block short and explicitly labeled as a model of refinement control, not a replacement for QFT.
2. Phrase as: "explicit witness that control maps are induced by refinement comparisons."
3. Use consistent "resolution \(h\)" language already adopted in `Derivation D6.0`.
