# S237 — Plan: Energy jump across impulses

Study the energy discontinuity at an impulse, complementing Remark 3.1b's
energy continuity at corners. For the free particle (L=m/2 q̇²):
ΔH = m(v₊²-v₋²)/2 = J·(v₊+v₋)/2 — work done at the average velocity.
This is the "inhomogeneous" counterpart of the Weierstrass-Erdmann second
condition.
