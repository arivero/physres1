# C78 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Analogy overreach**: readers think the paper claims calculus subtraction *is* QFT renormalization.
2. **Clutter**: the H0.2 list accumulates too many parentheticals.
3. **Redundancy**: later sections repeat the same toy story without adding computation.

## Mitigations
1. Keep "toy witness" phrasing and avoid identification language.
2. Keep to one parenthetical sentence.
3. Ensure later divergence sections provide real computations (e.g., contact beta functions), not restatements.
