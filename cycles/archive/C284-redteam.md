## Attack 1: Remark 3.1b overclaims novelty
The observation that SR weakens the centrifugal barrier is textbook-level.
**Mitigation:** The remark uses "transparent kinematic origin," not "new result."

## Attack 2: Remark 3.2a — "generically irrational" needs precision
ω = √(1-K²/(c²L²)) is algebraic in K/(cL). Is it obvious that it's
"generically irrational"? Yes: ω is irrational whenever K²/(c²L²) is not of
the form 1-(p/q)² for integers p,q, which excludes only a countable set of
L values. The set of rational ω values has Lebesgue measure zero.
**Mitigation:** The phrasing is mathematically correct.

## Attack 3: Section 3.1 is getting crowded
After C284, Section 3 has: main text + Remarks 3.1, 3.1a, 3.1b, 3.2, 3.2a.
That's 5 remarks in one section. However, they are each 2-3 sentences and
serve distinct roles (dimensional identity, Newtonian limit, critical exponent,
precession, Bertrand). The section reads as a sequence of short observations
on the same theme. Acceptable for a note-style paper.

## Attack 4: Example 5.2b fix could confuse readers
"Inverse-linear" is less familiar than "Hooke." But the old label was wrong.
The new one is accurate, and q=1 is not a commonly named force law.

## No blockers. All changes technically sound.
