# DX07 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Hard question
Was this sweep necessary given each paper already had a Q pass?
## Resolution
Yes. The Q passes for the older papers (Q73 for planck-area, Q79 for rg-fundamental) predated the metadata check becoming standard. The DX sweep caught exactly the kind of cross-cutting issue that individual Q passes miss.
