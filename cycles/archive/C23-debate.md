# C23 Debate

## Question
How far should we push H2.5b (“perturbative analyticity”) as a physics-motivated constraint, versus leaving it as an explicitly strong hypothesis whose role is only comparative/sieving?

## Current Resolution (working)
Treat H2.5b as a motivated-but-conditional constraint tied to a specified weak-coupling limit; do not present it as “forced”. Keep the paper’s core theorem-level content independent of H2.5b.
