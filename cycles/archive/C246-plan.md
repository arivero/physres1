# C246 — Plan

## Goal
Promote S206 blackboard (mollifier–polygon refinement parallel)
into dirac-probes paper as Remark 2.3.

## Scope
- Insert Remark 2.3 after Remark 2.2 in dirac-probes paper.
- Incorporate S206 reviewer feedback (mention Nauenberg/Pourciau hedge).
- ~8 lines, keep within PLB limit.

## Acceptance tests
1. Remark follows naturally from Remark 2.2.
2. No forced analogies; hedged language.
3. Paper stays at 4pp (~204 lines after insertion).
