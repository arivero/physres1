# S66 Debate: What is the minimal rooted-tree layer to include?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Do we need third-order trees (\(f''(f,f)\), \(f'(f'(f))\)) to make the point, or is the order-2 discrepancy \(f'(f)\) already sufficient?

## Working answer
Order 2 is sufficient for the “correction data exists and is structured” claim; order 3 can be named (not derived) as context if needed, but deriving it risks notation bloat for little gain.

## Next check
If the promotion draft reads too hand-wavy, add one line showing the order-3 decomposition into the two standard rooted trees (branch vs chain), without introducing full B-series machinery.
