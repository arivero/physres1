# C194 Execution: Promote Schwinger/EH remark

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Inserted Remark 3.3 after Example 3.2 (Uehling potential), before Section 4.
2. Content: Schwinger pair production rate ∝ m²(E/E_cr)² exp(-πE_cr/E), essential singularity invisible to perturbation theory. Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian with correct coefficients (2α²/45m⁴). Dimension-8 contact operators as QFT counterpart of Section 4 expansion. Fermions affect forces both perturbatively and non-perturbatively.
3. Built PDF: 9 pages, 162 lines (+3).
