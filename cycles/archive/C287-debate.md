# C287 Debate: Is this addition redundant with Remark 3.1b?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does the new remark duplicate existing critical-exponent language?

## Resolution
No. Remark 3.1b gives SR-vs-Newton explanation; new Remark 3.1c gives a compact general rule and disambiguates mechanisms. It improves structural readability.
