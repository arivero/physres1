# S29 Debate: Is the Source 4-Velocity \(U^\mu\) an Unwanted Extra Structure?

## Question
Does defining the invariant via projection with \(U^\mu\) undermine the “background-free” spirit by introducing a preferred frame?

## Current Resolution
It is acceptable for the current branch:
- the central-source problem already includes a distinguished worldline and its 4-velocity;
- the projection is covariant once \(U^\mu\) is part of the physical setup;
- this remains a model with source structure, not a universal background-free claim.
