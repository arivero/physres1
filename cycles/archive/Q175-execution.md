# Q175 Execution: Referee pass on C292 Package A deepening

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C292`

## Findings
- PASS.
- `Derivation D12.2` is appropriately scoped as an `O(V)` Duhamel-level composition witness, not a full constructive theorem.
- `Remark D12.2a` provides a concrete failure channel (singular/distributional attractive potentials requiring renormalization data), which is consistent with Appendix 10.5.
- Section 9.5 Package A status now accurately reflects both achieved witness level and remaining open frontier.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- `C293` (recommended): optional strengthening from bounded-potential witness to one explicit nontrivial potential case with closed-form kernel structure or sharper error control.

## Notes (non-actions)
- Main book now has checked technical starters across Packages A-E, with A and B both extended beyond initial skeleton status.
