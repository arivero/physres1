# S148 Debate: Casimir effect blackboard

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Casimir energy and force formulas verified correct: E_C/A = -π²ℏc/(720d³), F/A = -π²ℏc/(240d⁴).
- Zeta function argument imprecision found: ζ_H(-1/2) wrong, should be ζ(-3). Avoided in promoted remark.
- Force from boundary conditions alone (no source) correctly stated.
- Regularization scheme independence correctly parallels contact interaction cutoff independence.
- Experimental milestones all correctly attributed.
