# S279 Execution: Blackboard-to-notebook consolidation for threshold thread

Date: 2026-02-14

## Work completed
1. Overwrote `blackboards/3.md` with a branchboard for S275-S278 and D21-D22.
2. Updated `blackboards/README.md` slot index for slot 3.
3. Created `notebooks/central-force-threshold-bridge.md` and appended stabilized outputs.

## Layer split
- Blackboard: active branch menu, unresolved choices, near-term tactical gates.
- Notebook: stabilized memory (statements, diagnostics, process gates).

## Discovery flag
- `yes` — explicit blackboard/notebook split reduced note sprawl and makes branch selection faster.

## Addendum (append-only): rule-compliance extension
- Appended session policy and latest branch updates to `blackboards/3.md`.
- Appended stabilized refinements to `notebooks/central-force-threshold-bridge.md`.
- Confirmed continuing S/D updates should avoid `paper/notes/`.
