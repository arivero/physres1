# S82 Debate: Free-propagator composition closes the half-density normalization loop

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Does the free-propagator computation actually *prove* anything beyond what the abstract half-density formalism already guarantees?

## Resolution
Yes, it adds three things that the abstract formalism alone does not provide:

1. **Concreteness.** PA-D1.2a and PA-D1.4 assert that d/2 is the half-density weight and the Van Vleck exponent. S82 shows these are the *same* d/2 that enters the semigroup composition — the three-way cancellation of d/2 factors (two kernels + one Gaussian) is the mechanism by which abstract half-density pairing works in a specific model.

2. **Necessity of d/2 for composition.** If the prefactor exponent were anything other than d/2, the semigroup property would fail. This makes the d/2 a *physical requirement* (composition must hold) rather than a *geometric convention* (half-densities happen to have weight d/2).

3. **Tangent-groupoid witness.** The rescaling k_ε = ε^{d/2} · k absorbs the half-density Jacobian and yields an ε-independent symbol, confirming that the groupoid deformation is a change of half-density trivialization. This was stated abstractly in PA-D1.2a; S82 provides a concrete model.

The computation does NOT prove that L_* = Planck length. That remains conditional on the gravity-only sieve (PA-D1.3) plus universality hypotheses (PA-H2.4–H2.5).
