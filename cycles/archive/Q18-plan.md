# Q18 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b / D1.5c / D1.5d

## Goal
Run a referee-style check on the updated inverse-square block after adding D1.5d.

## Checks
1. Read D1.5b-D1.5d for logical continuity and scope discipline.
2. Sanity-check key asymptotics/domains:
   - D1.5b high-mass limit,
   - D1.5c endpoint,
   - D1.5d domain and endpoint.
3. Guardrail scan on cornerstone manuscript for cycle-label leakage.

## Acceptance Tests
- No internal contradiction across the three remarks.
- Candidate-status wording remains explicit (no universality overclaim).
