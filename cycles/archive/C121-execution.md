# C121 Execution: Promote S83 into planck-area (Remark PA-E5c)

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent study
- `S83`

## Edit summary
One insertion after PA-E5b:
- **New Remark PA-E5c** (~4 lines): dimensional verification that [G₀] = length^{-d}, [T] = length^d, half-density pairing at vertex, scalarization constant κ_*^{-d/2}. Connects to PA-D1.4a. For d=4: Λ_*^{-2} = area.
