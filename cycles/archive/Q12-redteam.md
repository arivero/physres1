# Q12 Redteam: What Would a Referee Object To?

## Likely Objections
1. “\(\tau\) is too abstract”: addressed by keeping it clearly tied to coarse-graining and by pointing to the explicit RG map paragraph already present.
2. “Running \(\hbar\)?”: avoided by treating \(\theta\) as a general parameter bundle and not identifying any component with physical \(\hbar\) here.
3. “Notation overload”: mitigated by restricting to one operator \(\mathcal G_b\) and one boxed equation.
