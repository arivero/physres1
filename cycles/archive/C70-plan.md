# C70 Plan: Promote Obstruction-Candidate List in main.md

## Goal
Promote S43 into the cornerstone manuscript as a short labeled heuristic list of concrete "refinement-to-zero" failure modes.

## Scope
- Add `Heuristic H0.2` near the new Zeno-style motivation paragraph in `paper/main.md`.
- Keep list short (2-3 items) and tied to loci already developed later.

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript edit is substantive and clarifies the long-term foundations goal.
- `cycles/C70-execution.md` logs manuscript diffstat.
