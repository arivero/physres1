# Q21 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Over-stacked remarks:** readability degradation near D1.5.
2. **Assumption blur:** planar extension mistaken for fully generic 3D motion.
3. **Quality-loop inertia:** too many Q cycles without new derivations.

## Mitigations
1. Keep each remark concise and formula-focused.
2. Preserve “planar” qualifier in D1.5g.
3. Continue with S33 derivation wave next.
