## Potential issues
1. The Appelquist-Carazzone theorem applies to renormalizable theories;
   for non-renormalizable EFTs the decoupling structure is more subtle.
   Mitigated: the remark discusses the tree-level matching, which is
   well-defined regardless.
2. The universality claim could be misread as "all UV completions give the
   same physics." Mitigated: stated as "same C₀" not "same physics" —
   higher-order contacts break the degeneracy.
3. Fierz rearrangement for t-channel fermion exchange is mentioned but not
   derived. Acceptable: the remark is about the structural point, not a
   derivation exercise.
