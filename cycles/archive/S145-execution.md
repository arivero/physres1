# S145 Execution: Feshbach resonances

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work Done
- Wrote blackboard slot 0: Feshbach resonances as laboratory realization of contact-coupling RG flow. a(B) formula, BEC-BCS crossover, SAE parametrization.
- Experimental cold-atom physicist reviewed: all 7 claims CORRECT. Formula, mechanism, SAE connection, BEC-BCS crossover, Chin et al. reference, all milestones verified. Noted that Feshbach resonances occur in both bosonic and fermionic atoms.
