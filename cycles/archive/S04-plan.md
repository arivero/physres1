# S04 Plan

## Goal
Produce the “convention map” promised in `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` Section 7:
cross-check the 2D/3D delta loop-integral normalizations and record how scheme constants (e.g. \(2e^{-\gamma}\)) enter the boundary-condition parameterization.

## Scope
1. Write a blackboard note that:
   - derives the 2D cutoff integral \(I(E;\Lambda)\) and isolates the \(i\pi\) term,
   - derives the leading 3D cutoff behavior and imaginary part,
   - records exactly which \(T\)-matrix normalization we are using and what “up to conventions” means here,
   - maps the short-distance \(K_0\) expansion constant (\(\gamma\)) to a rescaling of the transmutation scale (scheme dependence).
2. Optionally use SymPy for algebraic checks; paste commands + outputs into the blackboard note.

## Non-Goals
- No manuscript edits in this cycle.
- No new bibliography ingestion (network may be unreliable).

## Acceptance Tests
1. New blackboard note exists with an explicit “convention map” section and ≥2 promotion candidates.
2. Any potential factor-of-\(2\pi\) differences are explicitly called out as conventions, not silently assumed.
