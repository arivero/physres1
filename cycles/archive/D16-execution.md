# D16 Execution: SR critical-exponent unification target

Date: 2026-02-14
Status: Completed

## Actions
1. Selected one novelty target for immediate production: kinematic-degree rule for critical exponent shift.
2. Defined scope boundary to avoid over-claiming: this rule covers barrier-vs-potential asymptotics only, not dimensional identity effects.
3. Spawned S/B/C downstream work (`S269`, `B27`, `C287`).
4. **Context-poisoning guardrail event:** an exploratory `rg` command accidentally matched filenames under `cycles/archive/` (metadata lines only, no body reads). Re-anchored immediately by re-reading `AGENTS.md`, `docs/research-state.md`, and `cycles/index.md` before proceeding.

## Outcome
- Novelty target is explicit, bounded, and immediately executable.
- Downstream chain confirmed: `D16 -> DX11 -> S269 -> B27 -> C287 -> Q171 -> P01`.
