# DX11 Debate: Should this trigger a new principle version?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does the mechanism-separation finding warrant a v5 principle update?

## Resolution
No. It is a precision refinement inside existing v4 framing, not a new principle component. Keep as anomaly-register clarification plus manuscript wording guard.
