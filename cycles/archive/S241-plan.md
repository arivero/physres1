# S241 — Plan: Stratonovich midpoint in impulse-work formula

Study the connection between Remark 3.2a's midpoint velocity v̄=(v₊+v₋)/2
and the Stratonovich convention in stochastic calculus. The Itô convention
would use v₋ alone; the Stratonovich midpoint preserves the chain rule
(geometric structure). Goal: 4th Outlook item for dirac-probes.
