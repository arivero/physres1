# S222 — Debate

## Why deepen Section 4 rather than expand Sections 6–7?
Sections 6 and 7 are thin by design — they are scope-limiting sections that
explicitly defer to other papers. Expanding them would change the paper's
stated scope. Section 4 is the paper's analytical core and has room for
geometric and analytic depth without scope creep.

## Van Vleck transport equation — is it well-established?
Yes, it appears in DeWitt 1965 (already cited) and is standard in heat
kernel literature. The derivation is a direct consequence of the Jacobi
equation for geodesic deviation.

## Proper-time synthesis — pedagogical or substantive?
Somewhat pedagogical, but it makes the paper's central thesis (D/2 is the
half-density signature) explicit rather than leaving it implicit across
four separate remarks. A synthesis remark has value in a note of this length.
