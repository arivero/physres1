# Q158 Debate

**Strengths**: The remark distills the safe/unsafe distinction to a single functional-analytic criterion (continuity at evaluation point), making the classification principle explicit and testable. The contrast between Theorem 2.1's mollifier probing (continuous integrand) and Section 5.2's G₀(0,0;E) (singular kernel) is sharp and well-referenced.

**Minor observation**: The remark introduces "scheme dependence" terminology without defining it, though context makes it clear (dependence on UV cutoff Λ). This is acceptable at satellite-note level but would need expansion in a standalone article.
