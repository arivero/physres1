# C38 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Changes
1. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`
   - Corrected the 3D loop-integral imaginary sign (\(+i0\) prescription) in §5.8.1 and §5.9.
   - Updated the displayed 3D scattering-length parameterization to match the corrected sign.
   - Added a one-line reminder of \(1/(x+i0)=\mathrm{PV}(1/x)-i\pi\delta(x)\) in the convention map.
2. `blackboards/2026-02-10-contact-loop-integrals-1d-2d-3d.md`
   - Fixed missing factors of 2 in the 1D and 3D prefactors so the note matches the convention map.
