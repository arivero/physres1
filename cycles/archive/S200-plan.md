# S200 — Plan

## Goal
Study the Born approximation as a bridge between the bosonic exchange formalism of
fermionic paper Section 2 and the contact expansion of Section 4.

## Scope
- Write blackboard 0 with the Born approximation bridge content
- Target: Remark 2.3 in fermionic paper
- Spawn subagent reviewer (per S-cycle blackboard strategy)

## Status
Completed (previous session; cycle files recreated after context loss).
