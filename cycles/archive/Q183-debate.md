# Q183 Debate: Does Remark H1.2a over-formalize the convergence issue for a physics paper?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Is the Lipschitz-convergence framing too much numerical-analysis jargon for a Physics Reports survey that targets theoretical physicists, not applied mathematicians?

## Resolution
No. The remark earns its place by making precise a hedge (H1.1a) that would otherwise remain vague. The word "Lipschitz" appears exactly once and is immediately grounded in concrete physics: "away from the r = 0 collision singularity." A graduate student who has never seen the Lipschitz condition still gets the structural message: convergence works away from the singularity, and the equal-area invariant does not depend on convergence at all. The mathematical readers who do know the term get a precise statement they can verify against standard references. This is the right level for a remark (not a theorem, not a derivation) in a review paper.
