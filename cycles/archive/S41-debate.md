# S41 Debate: Which Missing Theme to Promote First?

## Question
Should the next promotion prioritize:
1) the "Zeno-style refinement paradox" motivation in the main paper, or
2) the QFT doubling bridge in the half-density QFT follow-up?

## Current Resolution
Promote the "Newton-limit paradox / limit-control" motivation first in the main paper, because it aligns with the repo’s long-term foundations goal and strengthens the cornerstone narrative; promote QFT doubling next once the motivation is explicit.
