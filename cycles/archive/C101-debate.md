# C101 Debate: finite-step strength of Newton’s area law vs Noether

Date: 2026-02-11

## Hard question
Does emphasizing the finite-step strength of the area law risk overstating a distinction that is already implicit in the polygonal derivation, adding redundancy instead of clarity?

## Current resolution
The manuscript currently states the equivalence of the area law and Noether’s angular-momentum charge but does not explicitly compare their domains of validity. A concise note that the polygonal invariant holds without smoothness or a Lagrangian symmetry assumption improves reader understanding of what is geometrically stronger while keeping the smooth-limit equivalence intact.
