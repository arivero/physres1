## Risks checked
- Doughnut beam claim: correctly restricted to |ℓ|≥1 (ℓ=0 noted as Gaussian-like)
- Gabor frame condition: correctly stated as ab<1 with Balian-Low at ab=1
- Phase-space cell area: ℏ/2 claim removed in final remark (avoided by not making the claim)
- Normalization: both Δt·Δf and Δt·Δω conventions given
- All OAM physics verified: Allen et al. 1992 correctly attributed
