# S62 Red Team: Risks

Date: 2026-02-10

## Failure modes
- Reader interprets “uniform \(\phi\)” as a statement about *all* central-potential eigenstates:
  - Mitigation: specify “\(L_z\) eigenstates / separated solutions have \(e^{im\phi}\)” and keep it scoped.
- The Fourier-tradeoff claim is challenged:
  - Mitigation: keep it at the level of “localized requires superposition” (true for periodic functions) and avoid quoting a specific inequality constant.
