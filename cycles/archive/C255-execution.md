# C255 — Execution: Relativistic stability expansions

## Changes
**Paper**: papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md (239 → 250 lines, +11, 4pp → 4pp, 4670 tok)

### Remark 4.3b (after line 179)
ISCO angular-momentum floor: L_ISCO = 2√3 M from L²=Mr²/(r-3M) at r=6M.
Contrasts with SR where any L > K/c gives stable orbits. The -2ML²/r³ curvature
term creates a finite stability floor absent in flat spacetime.

### Example 5.2b (after line 229, now line 232)
Enumerates stability thresholds for q=1 (unconditional), q=2 (boundary),
q=5/2 (v/c < 0.707), q=3 (none). Notes the Newtonian limit as a speed ceiling
going to zero.
