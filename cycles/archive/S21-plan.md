# S21 Plan: Generic-\(q\) Areal-Speed Circular Orbits and the Dimension Link

## Goal
Close the “general-\(q\)” gap in the Planck-areal-speed thread:
- derive the circular-orbit radius for a power-law central force \(F=K/r^q\) in terms of areal speed \(\dot A\),
- show the “Planck areal speed \(\Rightarrow\) reduced Compton length” cancellation is special to \(q=2\) (inverse-square),
- connect \(q=2\) to spatial dimension via the Green function of the Laplacian (Newtonian long-range forces).

This is a study/derivation cycle (blackboard-first), not a bibliography cycle.

## Scope
- Produce one blackboard note with:
  - the generic-\(q\) derivation including the \(q=3\) special case,
  - the “Compton-length exponent” observation (only \(q=2\) gives exponent \(1\)),
  - a short dimension link \(q=n-1\) for Newtonian gravity in \(n\) spatial dimensions (with the \(n=2\) log-potential caveat).
- No manuscript edits in this cycle (promotion happens in the next `C` cycle).

## Acceptance Tests
1. The note contains the boxed relation \(4m\dot A^2 = K r^{3-q}\) and the resulting \(r(\dot A)\).
2. The “Compton cancellation” is stated precisely: only \(q=2\) yields \(r\propto \hbar/(cM)\) (power \(1\)).
3. The dimension link is stated without overclaiming (Poisson/Green-function scaling; note the \(n=2\) exception).
