# S266 — Debate

## Position A: Add a Section 2 remark (advocated, then rebutted)

**Argument**: Section 2 is the only section without a remark. A brief remark
noting the "algebraic vs transcendental" distinction (for q = 2 vs q ≠ 2,
the orbit condition is algebraic in r vs transcendental) would flag the
structural uniqueness of the inverse-square case already at the general-q level,
before specializing in Section 3.

**Draft (4 lines)**:
> `Remark 2.1 (Algebraic simplification at q = 2).`
> For q ≠ 2, the circular-orbit condition L² = Kγmr^{3-q} is transcendental
> in r (since γ depends on v(r)). For q = 2, the identity v = K/L makes γ
> constant on the circular branch, so the condition becomes algebraic:
> r = L²/(Kγm). This simplification is the root of the exact results in
> Section 3.

**Rebuttal**: This draft makes a correct observation, but it:
1. **Anticipates Section 3 content**: the identity v = K/L is derived in
   Section 3 (lines 48–55). Citing it in a Section 2 remark would create a
   forward reference that breaks the deductive flow.
2. **Overlaps Remark 3.1**: Remark 3.1 already explains *why* q = 2 is special
   (dimensional uniqueness), and notes that for general q the mass and Lorentz
   factor reappear. The "algebraic vs transcendental" phrasing is a reformulation
   of the same fact.
3. **Costs 4–5 lines** of the 29-line budget for a reformulation, not new physics.

## Position B: Leave Section 2 remark-free (recommended)

**Argument**: Section 2 is setup material — it states the kinematic framework
and derives the general circular-orbit condition. Structural observations
*about* this framework are appropriately placed where they are first used
(Sections 3, 5). The asymmetry in remark count (0 in Section 2 vs many in
Sections 3–5) correctly reflects the paper's structure: Section 2 poses;
Sections 3–5 analyze.

The 29-line budget is better spent on:
- Extending Section 5 analysis (e.g., the deferred S260 E = mc²ω remark)
- Adding Outlook items
- Strengthening existing remarks

## Verdict

**Position B wins.** NOT PROMOTE. Section 2 should remain remark-free.
