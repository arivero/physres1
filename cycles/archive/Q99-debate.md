## Hard question
The sign error in the dimensional-transmutation formula (e^{1/(cg)} vs e^{-1/(cg)}) had survived all previous Q passes. Why?

**Analysis**: The formula appears in a discursive paragraph comparing the linear beta function of the toy model to the quadratic case. Prior Q passes focused on the toy model's own algebra (which was correct) and did not re-derive the standard QFT formula. The subagent, reading cold, checked the formula against the beta function definition two paragraphs above. This validates the subagent-delegation strategy: fresh-context reviewers catch cross-reference errors that in-context reviewers skip.

**Decision on deferred items**: The claim-label numbering offset (D6.x in Section 8) is an architectural decision that would require renumbering ~20 labels. Defer unless a full revision is planned.
