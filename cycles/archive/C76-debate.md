# C76 Debate: Inline Witness vs Separate Example Block

## Question
Should the ordering ambiguity witness be a parenthetical in H0.2, or a separate labeled example?

## Current Resolution
Keep it as a parenthetical witness to preserve flow; a full example block would be better suited for a later technical section or a dependent note.
