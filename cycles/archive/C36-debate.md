# C36 Debate

## Question
Should the draft include an explicit “dictionary” between scalar kernels (paired with \(\sqrt{|g|}\,d^Dx\)) and half-density kernels (paired with \(d^Dx\)), or is the densitized-field computation already sufficient?

## Working Resolution
Add only one explicit line in §4 giving the relation between kernels; keep the rest as-is.
