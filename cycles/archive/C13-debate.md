# C13 Debate

## Claim
Half-densities are the correct invariant object for composing kernels, and their normalization in \(d=4\) demands a universal area scale.

## Objection
Kernel composition can be made invariant in many ways; half-densities are not the only formalism.

## Resolution
Present half-densities as the minimal formalism that matches “compose by integrating over an intermediate variable” without extra choices, and justify by an explicit worked kernel model.

## Status
Partially addressed (explicit half-density derivation added; further concrete kernel model still needed).
