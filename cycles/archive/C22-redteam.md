## Failure Modes
1. “Cornerstone bloat”: adding too much Planck/scale material to `paper/main.md`.
2. “Notation proliferation”: introducing \(d_{\mathrm{comp}}\), \(d_{\mathrm{spatial}}\), \(D\) everywhere and reducing readability.
3. “Source overreach”: tightening prose in a way that implicitly upgrades heuristic claims to propositions.

## Mitigations
- Keep edits minimal and local; prefer a short notational guardrail over global symbol replacement.
- Add explicit “proved vs conjectural” labels rather than smoothing them away.
- Ensure any scale/Planck statements remain explicitly conditional and live in the dependent draft.
