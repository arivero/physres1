# S217 Execution: SR/GR Stability Contrast + Crossover Remark

## Findings
1. SR inverse-square (q=2): all circular orbits stable at all radii/speeds.
   GR (Schwarzschild): ISCO at r=6M. The entire difference is the curvature
   term -2ML²/r³, the same 5/6 fraction from Remark 3.2's precession.

2. The stability criterion 1+(2-q)γ²>0 cleanly partitions power laws:
   - q < 2: always stable (2-q > 0)
   - q = 2: always stable (criterion = 1 > 0)
   - 2 < q < 3: speed bound v/c < √(3-q)
   - q ≥ 3: never stable
   Thus q=2 is the BOUNDARY between unconditional and speed-conditional stability.

## Output
Two remarks drafted for C252: Remark 4.3a (SR vs GR) and Remark 5.2a (stability boundary).
