# Q44 Plan: Referee Pass on the New \(c\to\infty\) Subtraction Witness (`Derivation D0.2`)

## Goal
Quality-pass `paper/main.md` `Derivation D0.2` for:
- novelty (limit-control framing, not just kinematics),
- claim hygiene (avoid implying constant shifts are always irrelevant),
- reader flow near `Heuristic H0.3`.

## Checks
1. Read `Derivation D0.2` in context (Section 2.4).
2. Ensure it is explicitly scoped to particle mechanics.
3. Make minimal edits if wording invites an overgeneral claim.

## Acceptance
- No edits required, or only a short scope-disclaimer edit.
