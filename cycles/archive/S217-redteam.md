## Verdict: PASS (no Q cycle needed)

1. Remark 4.3a: correct — SR q=2 has no ISCO (criterion 1>0 always holds).
   GR ISCO at 6M from -2ML²/r³ term. This is standard.
2. Remark 5.2a: correct — direct analysis of 1+(2-q)γ²>0 for three cases.
   The "unique boundary" claim is precise: q=2 is the only integer value
   where the criterion transitions from unconditional to conditional.
3. No overclaiming — both remarks are observations about existing equations.
