# S84 Debate: Minimal hypotheses for Planck area

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is the "minimal set" really minimal? Could PA-H2.4 be weakened?

## Resolution
PA-H2.4 could be weakened to "constant on each connected component" rather than "globally constant", but this gives the same conclusion (a single length scale per connected component). The weakening is trivial for connected configuration spaces.

A more interesting weakening: allow σ_* to depend on a conformal class rather than being fully background-free. In D=4, conformal invariance of the scalar Laplacian conjugation (PA-H2.6a: D(4-D)/4 = 0) means the conformal and background-free choices coincide. So PA-H2.4 could be replaced by "conformal scalarization" and d=4 would still be singled out — but by a different mechanism (conformal simplicity rather than integrality sieve). This is an alternative route to the same conclusion, not a weakening of the same route.
