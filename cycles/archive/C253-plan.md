# C253 — Plan: Promote S218 HD-QFT expansion into manuscript

## Source
S218 (flat-space propagator + mass counterterm scaling study)

## Insertions
1. **Example HD-D4.3** (Section 4, after line 158): flat-space massless propagator
   G(x,y) = Γ(D/2-1)/(4π^{D/2}|x-y|^{D-2}), connecting D/2 to identity kernel.
2. **Remark HD-D5.3** (Section 5, after line 193): mass counterterm scaling Λ^{D-2}
   from heat kernel at coincidence, linking D/2 normalization to UV divergence.

## Expected impact
- +9 lines (234→243), stays at 5pp
- No new references needed (all formulas are standard, derivations self-contained)
- Closes the gap: Section 4 had no concrete example, Section 5 had no UV connection
