# D00 Execution: Fermionic Mediators → Contact/Boundary-Condition Limits (Theme L)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Decision
- Chosen target: Theme L (fermionic mediators → contact/boundary-condition limits).
- Why now: it is foundations-friendly, connects directly to the repo’s existing point-interaction/RG witnesses, and corrects a tempting but misleading “uncertainty sets range” analogy by identifying the more basic algebraic obstruction (Grassmann sources).

## One-sentence novelty claim (non-manuscript)
“A fermionic field does not yield an ordinary classical static potential via linear sourcing by commuting charges; the robust IR statement is instead an EFT/contact (diagonal-support) interaction encoded by local operators or boundary-condition data, with RG running when the contact limit is singular.”

## Scope disclaimer (non-manuscript)
- Not claiming fermions never affect forces; loop-induced effects and bosonic composites exist.
- Not claiming an ‘uncertainty principle’ controls range; the key obstruction is source/field algebra (Grassmann).
- The note will focus on a controlled IR matching witness (contact interaction), not on a full QFT of any specific model.

## Updates made
- `docs/research-log.md`: add an entry opening this pipeline and listing the exact next cycles.

## Spawned cycles (planned)
- `S61`: bounded derivation note: constant Born amplitude ↔ delta potential; derivative operators ↔ derivative contact terms; connect to existing point-interaction/RG witnesses.
- `B09`: OA anchor for Grassmann sources / fermionic generating functionals.
- `C87`: new dependent draft `papers/fermionic-mediators-contact-limits/main.md` (promotion wave).
- `Q45`: referee pass on `C87` (Q answers C only).
