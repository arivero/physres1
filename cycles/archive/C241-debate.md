# C241 — Debate

## Decisions
1. Both remarks inserted as a single promotion wave (new C-cycle rules).
2. Remark 2.3 uses "proportional to" for the Born amplitude to avoid
   sign/normalization convention dependence across textbooks.
3. Remark 4.6 explicitly names the Appelquist-Carazzone theorem rather
   than just describing the decoupling — gives the reader a handle to
   the literature.
4. The universality point in Remark 4.6 strengthens the paper's theme:
   contact data is what matters at low resolution, not UV details.
