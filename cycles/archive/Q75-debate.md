# Q75 Debate: Referee pass on C119

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is a 22-page paper that calls itself a "note" underselling its content?

## Resolution
Minor issue. "Note" is common in mathematical physics for self-contained technical contributions regardless of length. The abstract accurately describes the content. A future C cycle could upgrade the intro, but this is cosmetic and doesn't block publication.
