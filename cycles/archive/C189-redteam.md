# C189 Red Team: Casimir effect promotion

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Zeta function technicalities omitted (blackboard had wrong argument ζ_H(-1/2)). Promoted remark mentions zeta-function regularization generically without specifying the argument.
- No new references added to the paper — Casimir 1948 and Lamoreaux 1997 are cited by name in text. Could be strengthened with formal reference entries in a B cycle.
