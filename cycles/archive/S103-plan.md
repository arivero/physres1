# S103 Plan
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study cycle: create a concrete numerical worked example of Newton's kick-drift polygonal construction for an inverse-square central force. Verify equal-area property numerically at finite N. Prepare candidate text for promotion into Section 3.2 of the cornerstone.

## Steps
1. Write blackboard note with algorithm, two numerical cases (circular + elliptical), and candidate manuscript text.
2. Delegate blackboard review to subagent with random persona (new blackboard policy).
3. Incorporate feedback.
