# S159 Execution: Anomalous magnetic moment

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 1 on anomalous magnetic moment.
2. Reviewed by precision QED expert: α/(2π) correct; Schwinger pair production is 1951 not 1948 (corrected); (α/π)³ coefficient may be wrong (avoided in promotion); muon g-2 ~4σ discrepancy outdated — lattice QCD now agrees with experiment (updated).
3. Promoted as Remark 3.3 (before old Remark 3.3, which became 3.4): vertex correction, α/(2π), agreement to 10^{-12}, muon g-2 sensitivity to heavy-sector EFT operators.
