# S135 Debate: Decoherence

Date: 2026-02-13

## Pro
- Completes Section 5's "orbit pictures require packets" with the WHY
- Well-established physics (Zurek, Habib & Paz 1993)

## Con
- Decoherence is tangential to the action-angle indeterminacy focus
  → But Section 5 is explicitly about "foundations message" — decoherence is
    the key foundations result explaining why classical orbits are the robust states

## Resolution
Promoted as compact remark avoiding quantitative timescale claims.
