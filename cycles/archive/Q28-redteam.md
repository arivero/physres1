# Q28 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Bridge inflation:** readers think the new remark carries more than heuristic weight.
2. **Section pacing:** extra detail in Section 3 may delay arrival at concrete models.
3. **Cross-dimensional disconnect:** weak-derivative story remains isolated from Section 5.8.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the remark explicitly pattern-level.
2. Leave derivation details in blackboards, not manuscript.
3. Spawn S40 to wire this mechanism into the 1D/2D/3D comparison.
