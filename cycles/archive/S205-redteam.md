## Failure mode 1: Binet equation derivation not shown
The blackboard states the Binet equation without derivation. A referee
might want to see the steps.

**Mitigation**: The derivation is standard (Goldstein Ch. 7, Boscaggin
et al. 2020 already cited in the paper). For the paper remark, state the
result and cite the derivation source.

## Failure mode 2: "External potential" vs field-mediated force
The SR computation treats gravity as an external potential, which is
inconsistent with SR (gravity is not Lorentz-covariant as a scalar
potential). The 1/6 ratio is specific to this model.

**Mitigation**: The paper already notes this limitation in Section 6's
outlook ("replace external potential by field-mediated interaction").
The remark should state the model assumption explicitly.

## Failure mode 3: Page creep
Adding ~10 lines to a 218-line paper (→ ~228 lines) should keep it at
4pp compiled. Need to verify.
