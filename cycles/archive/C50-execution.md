# C50 Execution: Promote \(\tau\) Formalism into `paper/main.md`

## Work Completed
- Added `Derivation D6.0` to `paper/main.md` Section 8.2, defining a resolution parameter \(h\), a coarse-graining operator \(\mathcal G_b\), and the compatibility equation \(\mathcal G_b(A_{h/b,\theta})=A_{h,\tau_b(\theta)}\).
- Framed \(\tau_b\) as the control/flow map induced by refinement, and explained that failure of closure forces enlarging the operator/coupling family (counterterms).
- Connected the statement back to the existing cutoff-scale renormalization map \(R_{\Lambda\to\mu}\).
