# C35 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Changes
1. `papers/delta-objects/main.md`
   - Added a short clarification distinguishing \(\delta(f')\) (stationary-set localization) from \(\delta'\) (derivative-of-delta probing derivatives at a point).
   - Added a brief weak Euler–Lagrange remark explaining how extremal conditions are distributional and how corner/jump terms generate delta contributions.
