## Question
What is the cleanest “dimensionless coupling” choice for comparing 1D/2D/3D contact interactions without hiding scheme dependence?

## Notes
- 2D: marginal, logarithms, dimensional transmutation.
- 3D: power divergences; in Wilsonian variables, a nontrivial fixed point (unitarity) can appear.
- 1D: no UV divergence for the pure \(\delta\), but the full U(2) contact family has a richer fixed-point set under scaling.
