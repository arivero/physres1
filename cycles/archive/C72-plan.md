# C72 Plan: Clarify String-Tension vs UV Area-Parameter Branches

## Goal
Promote the S45 separation into `papers/planck-area/main.md` to prevent mixing:
- fundamental UV area parameters \(\alpha_\ast\) (Example E4), and
- emergent string tensions \(\sigma\) as transmutation outputs (H2.13 branch).

## Scope
- Add one short remark near Example E4 stating the distinction and branch placement.

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript edit is substantive and keeps hypothesis ladders separated.
- `cycles/C72-execution.md` logs manuscript diffstat.
