# C02 Debate

## Claim
Euler-Lagrange equations should be presented as a derivation from stationarity with explicit boundary conditions.

## Objection
Omitting function-space assumptions can hide nontrivial analytic requirements.

## Resolution
State assumptions explicitly: \(q\in C^2\) on \([t_i,t_f]\), admissible variations \(\eta\in C_c^\infty((t_i,t_f))\) or fixed-endpoint \(C^1\) variations.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
The derivation should explicitly name the fundamental lemma step (why \(\int F\cdot\eta=0\) implies \(F=0\)).

## Objection
This is a standard result and may feel like pedantry.

## Resolution
State it once as a proposition with conditions; it prevents hidden logic jumps and clarifies what changes in `C03` (weak/distributional settings).

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Noether rotational charge and Newtonian areal law should be identified as the same invariant in two languages.

## Objection
Historical Newton formulation does not invoke variational symmetry language.

## Resolution
Keep source-critical separation: identify equivalence as modern reformulation, not historical claim about Newton’s method.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Discrete-action notation in section 4 should match the refinement definition introduced earlier (\((q_{k+1}-q_k)/\Delta t_k\)).

## Objection
Restating discrete definitions risks redundancy.

## Resolution
Restate once in the action-composition pre-bridge to keep later `C04` reasoning self-contained.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Section 4 should prepare distributional probes but avoid premature singular products.

## Objection
Mentioning Dirac objects too early may look like proof rather than roadmap.

## Resolution
Label distributional extension as forward-looking heuristic and defer technical singular analysis to `C03`.

## Status
Accepted with caveat.
