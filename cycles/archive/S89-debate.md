# S89 Debate

## Hard question
Should the uniqueness argument for D4.1a be made more explicit in the paper?
## Resolution
The paper states "the unique solution (up to an overall constant phase)" which is correct. The uniqueness follows from the algebraic constraint (t+s)^β = (ts)^β requiring β = 0. The current presentation is adequate — a detailed proof would be an appendix-level exercise.
