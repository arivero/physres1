# S156 Debate: Neutrino-mediated forces

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- The neutrino-mediated force directly answers the paper's motivating question about fermionic potentials.
- It is a loop effect (box diagram), consistent with the Grassmann obstruction of Section 3.
- The 1/r⁵ scaling and contact-limit connection reinforce the paper's structural narrative.
