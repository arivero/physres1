# S218 — Study: HD-QFT expansion targets (flat-space propagator + counterterm scaling)

## Goal
Study two concrete additions for the half-density QFT paper:
1. **Flat-space propagator example** (Section 4): the massless scalar propagator
   G(x,y) = Γ(D/2-1)/(4π^{D/2} |x-y|^{D-2}) as an explicit worked bi-half-density
   kernel, connecting the D/2 exponent back to HD-D1.1a's normalization.
2. **Mass counterterm scaling** (Section 5): the one-loop mass correction as
   c(x)·K_Id(x,y), with UV scaling governed by the same D/2 exponent from
   the heat kernel at coincidence.

## Method
- Subagent research on both topics (mathematical content, notation matching).
- Draft remark/example text for each in paper style.
- Identify where each slots into the manuscript (after which existing element).

## Acceptance
- Two draft remark texts, each 5-10 lines, notation-consistent with existing paper.
- Clear mathematical chain from existing Section 2 normalization to each new result.
