## Potential issues
1. Remark 4.3b references Section 3.1 which uses K,c units while Section 4 uses G=c=1. The cross-reference is clearly labeled and Section 3.1 keeps physical units, so no ambiguity arises.
2. Example 5.2b's q=5/2 case: physically this is a force F∝r^{-5/2}, which isn't a standard named force. But as a mathematical intermediate between q=2 and q=3, it illustrates the speed bound concretely.
3. The phrase "non-relativistic shadow of a speed-dependent bound" is vivid but might be seen as metaphorical. The mathematics is clear from the preceding bullet points.
