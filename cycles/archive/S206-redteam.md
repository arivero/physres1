## Failure mode 1: Forced analogy
The mollifier and polygon are in different mathematical spaces with
different parameters. Calling them "the same" could mislead.

**Mitigation**: The remark says "shares its logical structure" and
"structural instance," not "is the same theorem." The blackboard
caveats section explicitly flags the difference.

## Failure mode 2: No new mathematics
The parallel is an observation, not a theorem. A referee might say
"this is just pedagogy."

**Mitigation**: Correct — it is pedagogical. But the dirac-probes
paper *is* a pedagogical companion note (see its §1 Motivation).
A structural remark connecting its content to the cornerstone's
architecture is exactly in scope.

## Failure mode 3: Half-density claim overreach
Calling the half-density normalization a "regularity gate" for the
path integral is imprecise. The normalization ensures composition,
but the path integral's existence is a deeper issue (measure theory,
oscillatory integrals, etc.).

**Mitigation**: The remark says "the same pattern recurs with the
half-density normalization playing the role of the regularity gate,"
which is deliberately analogical. The blackboard's Heuristic H0.2a
reference (no Lebesgue on path space) provides the precise caveat.

## Failure mode 4: Page creep
The remark adds ~8 lines to a 196-line paper (→ ~204 lines, still 4pp).

**Mitigation**: Within PLB limit. Acceptable.
