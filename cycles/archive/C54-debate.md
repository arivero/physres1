# C54 Debate: Should the SR Interpolation Sit in Planck-Area or Relativistic-Orbits?

## Question
Is the SR interpolation primarily a relativistic-orbit result, or is it better treated as an extension of the Planck-areal-speed witness?

## Current Resolution
Promote it in `papers/planck-area/main.md` as a short continuation of D1.5:
- the core variable being fixed is the areal-speed scale (\(\dot A_0\)), central to the Planck-area thread;
- the relativistic-orbits paper already contains the SR mechanics baseline, so duplication there is unnecessary;
- keep one explicit sentence that the result is model-level (mechanical SR + external inverse-square force).
