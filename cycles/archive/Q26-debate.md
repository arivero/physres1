# Q26 Debate: Should D1.5l Name a Fixed Percentage?

## Question
Should the nonlinear-escalation trigger be a fixed percentage threshold, or remain deliberately soft?

## Current Resolution
Keep a soft threshold ("few-percent") because:
- it is operationally actionable,
- it avoids false precision across instruments/datasets,
- it preserves room for later calibration by domain-specific error models.
