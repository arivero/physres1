# Q46 Execution: Referee Pass on `C88`

Date: 2026-02-10

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C88`

## Findings
- The remark is bounded and correctly avoids angle-operator claims.
- The witness \(\psi(r,\phi)=R(r)e^{im\phi}\Rightarrow |\psi|^2\) independent of \(\phi\) is correct and directly supports the intended interpretive point.
- Placement near the stationary-phase discussion is appropriate and improves reader interpretation (“classical recovery” refers to semiclassical concentration/wavepackets, not eigenstate localization).

## Suggested follow-ups
- None required.
