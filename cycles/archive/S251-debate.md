# S251 — Debate
The HJ viscosity connection is genuine and makes explicit a link usually
left implicit. However: (1) viscosity solutions are unfamiliar to many
classical mechanicians in the target audience; (2) the paper's argument is
complete without this; (3) the paper is already at 7pp (over PLB limit);
(4) the Outlook item 2 already points to this direction. Expansion of the
Outlook item (Option B) is the appropriate form. A main-text remark (Option A)
would be justified only if the paper had room and targeted a PDE audience.
