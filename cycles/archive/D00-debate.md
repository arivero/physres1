# D00 Debate: What does “fermions generate a potential” mean (and what is the correct replacement)?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
What is the strongest referee-safe statement we can make without overclaiming?

## Options
1. “Fermions cannot generate potentials.” (Too strong; false in several effective senses.)
2. “Fermionic fields do not yield ordinary classical static potentials from commuting sources via linear sourcing; meaningful effects enter via loops/composites/EFT contact limits.” (Precise and defensible.)

## Decision
Choose (2).

## Rationale
It isolates the real obstruction (Grassmann sources) while leaving room for known effective mechanisms (loops, composites, contact EFT) and keeps the note bounded.
