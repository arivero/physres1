## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. Half-density normalization needs one explicit kernel/groupoid composition example to move beyond slogans.
2. The “Planck area” identification is plausible but currently heuristic; alternative universal area scales are not excluded.
3. The link between areal-speed arguments and half-density scaling needs a clean interface lemma.

## Evidence Needed
1. Add a concrete half-density composition calculation and track how normalization scales enter (execute `C13`).
2. Clarify which claims depend on \(d=4\) specifically and which generalize.
