# S224 — Plan: Delta-objects d=2 resolvent example

## Goal
Add Example 4.1b (d=2 delta potential: logarithmic divergence and transmutation)
as a companion to Example 4.1 (d=1). Currently d=2 is summarized in Remark 4.2
but not worked through explicitly.

## Content
The free Green function in d=2 at the origin: G₀(0,0;E) ~ (m/2πℏ²) ln(Λ/κ).
Rank-one perturbation denominator: 1 - g·G₀ = 0. With bare coupling
g(Λ) = 2πℏ²/(m ln(Λ/α)), the bound-state condition gives κ=α.
Connects to Example 5.1a (scalarization perspective on same physics).

## Method
Draft directly (standard 2D quantum mechanics result from Jackiw 1991).
