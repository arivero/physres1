# S19 Execution: Invariant Conformal-Rescaling Formula for \u03a6\u0394\u03a6^{-1}

## Work Completed
- Added a blackboard note deriving the conformal-rescaling behavior of the half-density conjugated Laplacian for \(g=e^{2\sigma}\bar g\) in \(D\) dimensions, making the \(D(4-D)/4\) coefficient of \(|\nabla\sigma|^2\) explicit:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-half-density-laplacian-conformal-rescaling-invariant.md`

## Key Result
Within the conformal class, the absence of the quadratic-gradient term at \(D=4\) is not an artifact of choosing a flat base metric: it holds for any base metric \(\bar g\).
