# C18 Execution

## Draft Deltas
1. Added Section 5.8 to `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` with explicit 3D (power divergence + scattering length + unitarity fixed point heuristic) and 1D (U(2) contact family + fixed-point set) discussions, anchored to [BoyaRivero1994Contact] for the 1D RG flow picture.
2. Rebuilt `papers/rg-fundamental/main.pdf`.

## Status
Completed.
