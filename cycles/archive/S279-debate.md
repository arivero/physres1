# S279 Debate: Are we duplicating too much between blackboard and notebook?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does copying stabilized material from blackboard to notebook create harmful duplication?

## Resolution
Short-lived overlap is acceptable. Blackboard remains scratch/selection-oriented; notebook stores stable memory.

## Addendum
With the new rule, notebooks become the primary stabilization layer for S/D outputs; this is aligned with the original workspace-hygiene intent.
