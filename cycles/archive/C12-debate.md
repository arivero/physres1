# C12 Debate

## Claim
In four dimensions, normalizing amplitudes as half-densities forces a universal area scale; identifying it with Planck area is natural.

## Objection
“Forces” may overstate what is currently only dimensional analysis unless tied to a concrete kernel or groupoid composition model.

## Resolution
State the dimensional argument as a proposition about units/normalization, and keep the “Planck area” identification as a heuristic until a concrete model calculation is supplied.

## Status
Accepted.
