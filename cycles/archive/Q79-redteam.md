# Q79 Red Team

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes

### 1. Over-review fatigue
- Risk: after many Q cycles in a row on different threads, the referee eye gets dull.
- Mitigation: this Q79 is the first quality pass on rg-fundamental in a while (last was Q57 on a different topic). Fresh perspective on this specific paper.

### 2. Missing the forest for the trees
- Risk: focusing on RG-D1.2a might miss broader issues with the paper.
- Mitigation: scanned the full paper (Sections 1–7) and references. Identified the supplementary material reference as a pre-existing issue. No other structural problems found.
