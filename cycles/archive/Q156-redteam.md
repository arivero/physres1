# Q156 — Red Team

Only the index formula needed fixing; all other attacks fail:
1. Redefining n to save "Λ^{D-2n}": impossible, text locks n as Seeley-DeWitt index ✓
2. Scheme-independence too strong: no, qualified by "which counterterms diverge" ✓
3. Cutoff-dimreg duality exact: Λ^{D-2(n+1)} ↔ Γ-pole at D=2(n+1) ✓
4. [Vassilevich2003] appropriate for heat-kernel scheme comparison ✓
