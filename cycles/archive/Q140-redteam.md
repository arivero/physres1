# Q140 — Red Team

## Potential blind spots
1. Referee verified formulas numerically (python3) — good practice.
2. The referee correctly identified that "no stable circular orbit exists regardless of radius" is about *stable* orbits (unstable ones exist for 3M < r < 6M). This matches the paper's precise language.
3. The "non-relativistic shadow" metaphor was flagged as potentially too literary, but the referee correctly noted the mathematics is clear from the preceding bullets.
