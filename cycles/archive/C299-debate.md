# C299 Debate: Should this bridge sit in the main text or stay in notes?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does inserting a threshold bridge in Section 3.3 risk overloading an areal-law section with orbit-stability detail?

## Resolution
The insertion is justified because it is one short remark that clarifies a frequent Newton-vs-SR confusion and explicitly defers full derivation detail to companion work.
