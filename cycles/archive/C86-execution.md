# C86 Execution: Concrete \(G\) Witness via Half-Density Scalarization Scale in \(D=4\)

## Work
- Extended `paper/main.md` `Heuristic H4.0a` with a concrete dimensional witness:
  in a spacetime \(D=4\) half-density scalarization setting the required universal scale is an area, naturally supplied by the Planck area \(\ell_P^2=\hbar G/c^3\).

## Diffstat

## Result
The "why \(G\)?" part of the constants-as-controls narrative now has a concrete hook tied to the half-density scalarization scale question (without assuming more gravitational structure than needed).
