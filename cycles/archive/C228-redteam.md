# C228 Redteam: Promote QND Measurement Remark

## Checks Performed
- Physics review by subagent (quantum optics experimentalist persona) during S187 ✓
- All HIGH/MEDIUM issues resolved before promotion ✓
- Cycle-tag and transcript leak checks: PASS ✓

## No Blocking Issues
Remark 5.7 is consistent with paper narrative, physics-sound, and properly cross-referenced. Bibliography entries are canonical and correctly formatted.

## Net Prose Addition
Remark introduces QND measurement, back-action redistribution, cavity-QED realization, and Zeno distinction—all essential to complete Section 5 measurement scope.

## Status
Ready for manuscript commit.
