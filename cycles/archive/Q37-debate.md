# Q37 Debate: Does the Ordering Witness Belong in the Introduction?

## Question
Should the ordering-witness parenthetical be moved out of the Introduction into a later technical section?

## Current Resolution
Keep it in the Introduction because it is one short parenthetical that concretizes "non-uniqueness" in the same way H0.2a concretizes "non-existence". If it grows beyond one line, move it later.
