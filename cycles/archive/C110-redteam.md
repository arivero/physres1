# C110 Red Team: Citation update failure modes

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes

- **"Two citations for the same point is redundant"**
  - Response: the papers make different contributions (historical identification vs modern terminology). Both are relevant to H1.2's claim.

- **"The 2018 paper might not be peer-reviewed in time"**
  - Response: it was published in AJP (peer-reviewed journal) in 2018. DOI confirmed.

- **"Citation format inconsistency"**
  - Response: follows the existing bracket-key format used throughout the manuscript. Both keys are defined in bibliography.md.

- **"No manuscript change needed — this is just a bibliography preference"**
  - Response: the manuscript currently cites only the 1994 paper for a claim that the 2018 paper supports more directly. A reader checking the citation would find "canonical/symplectic mapping" rather than "symplectic Euler integrator." Adding the 2018 citation closes this gap.
