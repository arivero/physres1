# Q53 Debate: Keep “companion note” cross-references vs make fully standalone

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Should the half-density QFT note avoid cross-references entirely and include all supporting derivations inline, or is it acceptable to keep a small number of “companion note” pointers?

## Recommendation
Keep the current light cross-references for now; if/when the note becomes a submission target, run a dedicated `C` wave to inline the minimal supporting pieces or add standard citations.
