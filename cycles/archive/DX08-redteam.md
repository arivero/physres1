## Failure modes
### 1. Loss of detail in consolidation
- Risk: the merged blackboard is 38 lines vs 167 lines original. Some derivation detail lost.
- Mitigation: the detailed derivations are in the manuscripts (D6.2a-sg, Section 10.5) and in the S76/S77 cycle execution files. The blackboard's purpose is quick reference, not archival.
