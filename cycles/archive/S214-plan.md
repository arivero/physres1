# S214 Plan: Why D=10,11,26 Are Absent from the Half-Density Framework

## Objective
Investigate the "dog that didn't bark": the half-density / RCP framework identifies
d=2,3,4 as special dimensions via the d/2 exponent, but the famous string-theoretic
dimensions D=6,10,11,26 do not appear. Is this expected, or does it signal a gap?

## Method
- Review what the d/2 framework predicts as "special"
- Compare with the mechanisms that produce 10,11,26 (anomaly cancellation, SUSY, worldsheet conformal invariance)
- Determine whether absence is structural or whether a connection exists
- Record findings on blackboard

## Serendipity potential
This was flagged by the user as a "Curious Incident" observation — exactly the kind
of structural absence that could become a serendipity finding.
