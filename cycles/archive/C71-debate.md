# C71 Debate: Keep GR Baseline Minimal or Add ISCO Now?

## Question
Should the GR baseline stay restricted to photon sphere only, or include the standard timelike ISCO data?

## Current Resolution
Include ISCO now. It closes an explicit "next wave" TODO in the draft and keeps the GR baseline parallel to the SR stability section: both now have a clear stability threshold statement.
