# S201 — Execution

## Work Done
1. Wrote blackboard 1 with heavy-mediator decoupling content:
   - Decoupling limit M → ∞ with G = g²/M² fixed
   - Contact limit: Yukawa → delta
   - Wilson coefficient matching UV → IR
   - Universality: different UV completions → same C₀
   - Appelquist-Carazzone theorem as field-theoretic justification
2. Spawned subagent reviewer (persona: EFT specialist).
3. Reviewer feedback applied to blackboard.

## Result
Blackboard 1 ready for promotion to Remark 4.6 in fermionic paper.
New reference: Appelquist and Carazzone 1975, Phys. Rev. D 11, 2856.
