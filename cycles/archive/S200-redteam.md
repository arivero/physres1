## Potential issues
1. The Born approximation is only first-order in g². For strong coupling the
   connection is less direct. Mitigated by the "beyond Born" paragraph.
2. The sign convention for V(r) vs A(q) varies across textbooks. The remark
   uses "proportional to" to avoid convention dependence.
3. The scattering length formula a ∝ m_red g²/m² is Born-level; exact a
   requires the full T-matrix. Stated as "Born amplitude determines" to
   be accurate.
