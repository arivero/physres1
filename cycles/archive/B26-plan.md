# B26 Plan: Transcribe Hamilton 1834

## Objective
Transcribe the key sections (1-5) of Hamilton's "On a General Method in Dynamics" (1834)
from the PDF at `sources/Hamilton-GenMeth-1834.pdf`.

## Scope
- Full transcription of Sections 1-5 (core theoretical framework, ~9 pages)
- Section-by-section summaries for Sections 6-22 (applications, ~53 pages)
- Output: `sources/Hamilton1834-transcription.md`

## Rationale
Pre-1950 public domain paper. Cited as [Hamilton1834] in delta-objects and central bibliography.
Contains the characteristic function V whose mixed Hessian ∂²V/∂x∂a is the ancestor of the
Van Vleck determinant. The principal function S(q,Q,t) is in the Second Essay (1835).
