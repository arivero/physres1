# C211 — Execution

## What was done
Promoted S170 resurgence blackboard as **Remark 2.8** in the uncuttable
paper, placed immediately after Remark 2.7.

### Content of Remark 2.8
The remark explains how resurgent trans-series (Écalle) provide a
non-perturbative completion of asymptotic expansions, with the
Bender–Wu large-order relations as the concrete mechanism linking
perturbative coefficients to instanton actions.

### Reviewer corrections incorporated
- IR (not UV) renormalons on the positive Borel axis.
- No spurious sign factor in the large-order formula.
- Growth rate stated as $A^{-n}\,\Gamma(n+b)$ with log corrections.
- Both Bender–Wu 1969 and 1973 papers cited.
