# C254 — Debate

## Q: Does this expand the paper enough?
**A:** +6 lines is modest, but Section 5.2 went from 3 lines of text to ~10 lines
with concrete physics content. The section was the paper's thinnest by far.

## Q: Should the summary table be updated?
**A:** No — it already has "δ potential, d≥2: Requires care / Yes" which covers
the new content. The table is a summary, not a replacement.
