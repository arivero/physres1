# S264 — Plan

## Objective
Reference scan for the "Relativistic Central Orbits as Refinement-Witnesses" satellite paper.
The paper currently cites only 2 sources:
1. [BoscagginDambrosioFeltrin2020RelKepler] — SR relativistic Kepler problem
2. [Carroll1997LectureGR] — GR lecture notes (Schwarzschild geodesics)

## Scope
Evaluate 6 candidate references (a–f below) against the paper's actual content:
- SR circular orbits, v=K/L, L>K/c bound (Sec 2–3)
- SR orbit equation (Binet-type), precession, 1/6 of GR (Remark 3.2)
- Schwarzschild effective potential, photon sphere, ISCO (Sec 4)
- SR stability criterion 1+(2-q)gamma^2 > 0, critical exponent shift (Sec 5)
- Bertrand's theorem in SR context (Remark 3.2a)

## Candidates
a) Sommerfeld 1916 (relativistic hydrogen / fine structure)
b) Goldstein, Poole & Safko (Classical Mechanics textbook)
c) Weinberg 1972 (Gravitation and Cosmology)
d) Wald 1984 (General Relativity)
e) Bertrand 1873 (original Bertrand's theorem)
f) Sommerfeld 1916 / Kramers (old quantum theory orbit quantization)

## Deliverables
- Evaluation of each candidate
- Recommendation of 1-2 additions
- Promotability assessment for a follow-up B cycle
