# C51 Plan: Start Relativistic-Central-Orbits Dependent Draft

## Goal
Create a new dependent draft `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` and seed it with one real, derivation-first result from S24:
- inverse-square SR circular orbit: \(v=K/L\) and \(L>K/c\),
- plus the SR power-law circular-orbit condition \(L^2=K\gamma m r^{3-q}\).

## Scope
- Add `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` with:
  - abstract + purpose,
  - SR derivation section,
  - a short “next waves” section (stability + GR baseline).
- Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
1. The new paper is more than a skeleton: it includes at least one boxed derivation (the SR bound).
2. No transcript citations; bibliography keys only.
3. Cycle recorded and committed.
