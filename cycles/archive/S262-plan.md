## Title
Sommerfeld fine structure connection to the SR orbit equation

## Objective
Investigate whether the SR orbit equation derived in the relativistic-central-orbits
paper (Remark 3.2) is identical to the equation Sommerfeld used in 1916 for the
relativistic hydrogen atom, and whether a short remark connecting the classical
precession parameter omega to Sommerfeld's quantum fine structure formula is
appropriate.

## Scope
1. Confirm mathematical identity between the paper's orbit equation and Sommerfeld's.
2. Trace how omega appears in the Sommerfeld energy formula via quantization.
3. Assess whether a 2-3 sentence remark is promotable into the paper.

## Method
- Web research on Sommerfeld's 1916 derivation, the Bohr-Sommerfeld model,
  and the "Sommerfeld puzzle" (agreement with Dirac).
- Compare the paper's omega^2 = 1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2) with Sommerfeld's
  omega^2 = 1 - Z^2 e^4/(c^2 p_theta^2).
- Check whether the quantization step (p_theta = k hbar) produces
  omega = sqrt(1 - alpha^2 Z^2 / k^2) as expected.

## Expected output
- Execution report with mathematical verification.
- Promotability assessment.
- Draft remark text if promotable.
