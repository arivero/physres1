# C242 — Plan

## Goal
Promote heat kernel bi-half-density content (blackboard 0 / S202) into
the half-density QFT paper as Remark HD-D4.2.

## Target
`papers/half-density-qft/main.md`, after Remark HD-D4.1 (doubling),
before Section 5 (contact terms).

## Content
- DeWitt-Schwinger expansion with VVD
- Half-density heat kernel K̃ definition
- Trace without √|g| (key observation)
- Forward reference to Section 5's counterterms
- Two new references: DeWitt 1965, Vassilevich 2003
