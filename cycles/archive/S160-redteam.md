Risk: overemphasizing Kontsevich formality when the paper's potentials are simple (flat R²ⁿ).
Mitigation: remark focuses on the conceptual point (★ as ℏ-deformation) rather than deep
formality theory. The flat-space Moyal product is the key object; Kontsevich is mentioned
as the general existence theorem.
