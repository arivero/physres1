# S06 Debate

## Question
Is H2.5 (“no fractional powers”) actually a physically meaningful hypothesis, or does it depend on arbitrary choices of coupling coordinates?

## Working Resolution
Treat H2.5a (integrality) as a *useful but coordinate-dependent* sieve, and treat H2.5b (perturbative analyticity around a distinguished limit) as the more invariant statement (stable under analytic reparametrizations). Any “dimension sieve” claim must specify:
1. the distinguished base point (what “weak coupling” means), and
2. the admissible coupling set (what counts as an input vs a convention).
