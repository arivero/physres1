# Q32 Debate: Is the List Too Strong for an Introduction?

## Question
Does listing "non-uniqueness" and "non-convergence" in the introduction overstate the foundational difficulty?

## Current Resolution
Keep the list because it is explicitly heuristic and is immediately tied to later concrete sections. The list signals what the paper will actually control, rather than claiming classical mechanics is inconsistent.
