## Failure modes
1. Extension statement could overclaim full classification.
2. Delta-bound-state formula may be sign/mass-factor inconsistent.
3. Connection to Package B may be too implicit.

## Mitigations
1. Restrict to one explicit extension family witness.
2. Use standard jump condition with explicit coefficient and bound-state sign check.
3. Add explicit sentence linking domain data to representation compatibility.
