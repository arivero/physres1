# C15 Debate

## Claim
“RG is fundamental” reads strongest when (i) an explicit computation exists and (ii) the computation is triangulated against independent sources.

## Objection
Independent sources may be non-OA or hard to access; preprints remain a pragmatic reality in physics.

## Resolution
Treat preprints as guides, but anchor key formulas with at least one independent source when possible; otherwise mark the validation step as `PENDING` and keep claims explicitly labeled as derivations from stated assumptions.

## Status
Open.
