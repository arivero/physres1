# S67 Execution: promotion-ready Euler modified equation + explicit \(f'(y)[f(y)]\) notation

Date: 2026-02-11

## Work performed
- Wrote a promotion-oriented blackboard note with explicit derivative notation and a compact modified-equation derivation.
- Ran a SymPy series check in the scalar model \(y'=y^2\) to validate the \(O(h^2)\) coefficients.

## Outputs
- `blackboards/2026-02-11-explicit-euler-modified-equation-promotion-block.md`

## Status
Completed; queued for promotion in `C99`.
