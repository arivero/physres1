# S261 Plan: Capture conditions across Newton/SR/GR refinement hierarchy

**Target paper:** `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`

## Study question

Compare the "fall-to-center" / capture thresholds across the three levels of
the refinement hierarchy (Newtonian, SR, GR) and assess whether a concise
remark or Outlook addition is promotable.

Specific angles to evaluate:

1. **Capture thresholds.** Newton: no capture for q=2 (any L>0 suffices).
   SR: capture at L = K/c (Section 3.1, line 79). GR: ISCO floor at
   L = 2sqrt(3) M (Remark 4.3b); actual plunge from unstable circular
   orbit at L = 4M.

2. **Parameter-space enrichment.** Newton: (E,L) determines a conic.
   SR: (E,L) determines a precessing conic with omega(L). GR: (E,L,M)
   with richer structure (ISCO, photon sphere, unstable band).

3. **Existing coverage.** Remark 4.3g already quantifies the SR->GR
   angular-momentum floor ratio as 2sqrt(3). Check whether a capture-focused
   remark adds anything beyond what 4.3g already says.

## Deliverable

- Analysis of the most promotable observation.
- Draft 2-3 sentence remark or Outlook addition.
- Promotion assessment.
