# D10 Debate: Does a numerical-analysis witness clarify or distract?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Does adding an explicit Runge–Kutta/step-doubling computation strengthen the “RG as compatibility under composed refinement” thesis, or does it risk reading like an off-topic numerical-analysis detour?

## Current position
Include it, but keep it minimal and explicitly labeled as an analogy witness: one worked expansion through the first nontrivial rooted tree is enough to make “two steps vs one step” correction data concrete without changing the paper’s scope.

## What would change my mind?
- If the witness requires introducing substantial new notation (full B-series machinery) or forces a long excursus; in that case it belongs in a separate note only.
