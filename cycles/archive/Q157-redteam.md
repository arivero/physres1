# Q157 Redteam

**Surface concern:** Could v̄=(v₊+v₋)/2 be misread as a time-averaged velocity over a finite interval, rather than the mean of the two limiting velocities at the impulse instant?

**Resolution:** The notation is standard and the context (immediately after Theorem 3.2, which defines v₊ and v₋ as one-sided limits at t₀) makes the meaning unambiguous. No change needed.
