# S172 — Execution

Wrote blackboard on Levinson's theorem (phase shift counts bound states, half-bound state at unitarity). Reviewed by scattering theory expert — caught: (1) remove "(mod π)" misrepresentation, (2) use n_0 not n_b for s-wave count, (3) state δ(∞)=0 convention, (4) note short-range requirement, (5) fix "crosses π" language.
