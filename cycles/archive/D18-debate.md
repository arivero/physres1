# D18 Debate: Do we need another C cycle immediately?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Should we launch `C300` immediately to adjust `Remark P1.1a`, or first run deeper S-cycle stress tests?

## Resolution
Run S first. The current remark is acceptable, but a more careful coefficient/assumption pass may change what is safe to claim in one sentence.
