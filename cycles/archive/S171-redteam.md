## Verification checklist

1. **SL(2,ℤ) mentioned** — The blackboard now presents the full duality
   group $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ generated by $S$ and $T$, not
   just the $g \leftrightarrow 1/g$ inversion.
   ✓ Corrected.

2. **N=4 "conjectured to be exact"** — Language weakened from "is exact"
   to "is conjectured to be exact, with strong supporting evidence from
   BPS spectrum matching."
   ✓ Corrected.

3. **KW self-dual coincidence noted as special** — The Kramers–Wannier
   critical point $\tanh\beta_c = e^{-2\beta_c}$ is presented as a
   *special feature* of the self-dual case, not a generic property of
   all dualities.
   ✓ Correctly framed.

4. **No UV/IR = asymptotic safety claim** — The speculative paragraph
   has been entirely removed. No residual traces.
   ✓ Dropped.
