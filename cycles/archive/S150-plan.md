# S150 Plan: Effective field theory as refinement hierarchy

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study effective field theory as the systematic framework for organizing theories as a refinement hierarchy, for promotion into uncuttable satellite Section 4.

## Steps
1. Write blackboard 1: EFT paradigm, operator expansion, matching conditions, Wilson coefficients as extra data, SM as EFT.
2. Launch reviewer subagent (particle phenomenologist persona).
3. Incorporate corrections and promote to Remark 4.4.
