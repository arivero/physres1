# D05 Execution: Update Durable Logs + Queue Submission-Readiness Referee Pass

Date: 2026-02-11

## Decision
- Chosen next target: `Q49` (submission-readiness referee pass on the main manuscript; parent `C92`).
- Why now: it directly supports the foundations-journal goal by surfacing clarity/claim/flow issues before further expansion.

## One-sentence novelty claim (non-manuscript)
The main paper has been hardened to state RCP operationally (closure-with-update form) and stripped of repo-process metadata; the next step is a referee pass to ensure readability and claim hygiene at submission quality.

## Updates made
- `docs/research-log.md`: recorded `D04/B11/C92` completions and queued `Q49`.
- `docs/research-state.md`: updated “Next Cycle Target” to `Q49` (and optional `B12` for `Dirac1933` if needed).

## Spawned cycles
- `Q49`: referee-style pass on `C92` / current `paper/main.md` for submission readiness.
