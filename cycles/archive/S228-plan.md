# S228 — Plan: HD-QFT ζ-function determinant from heat-kernel trace

The spectral ζ-function ζ_P(s) = Tr P^{-s} = Γ(s)^{-1} ∫ t^{s-1} Tr K(t) dt
has poles at s = D/2 - n from the Seeley-DeWitt expansion. The functional
determinant det P = exp(-ζ'_P(0)) is finite and coordinate-independent.
In half-density language the trace is intrinsic (no √|g| needed).

Target: Remark HD-D5.4 after Remark HD-D5.3, using [Vassilevich2003].
