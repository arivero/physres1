# S62 Plan: Action–Angle Indeterminacy Witness (Fourier on the Circle)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Goal
Produce one explicit, bounded derivation supporting Theme K:
- \(L_z\) eigenstate \(\Rightarrow\) uniform \(\phi\) distribution,
- localization in \(\phi\) requires superposition over many \(m\) (Fourier tradeoff).

## Deliverable
- A blackboard note with a copyable promotion block:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-action-angle-central-potentials-fourier-witness.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S62-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- A self-contained derivation (no citations required).
- A copyable promotion block suitable for a later dependent note.
