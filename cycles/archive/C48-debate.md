# C48 Debate: Does This Sidebar Distract From the Main Spine?

## Hard Question
Will a curved-space conformal-rescaling remark in the cornerstone paper distract from the main QM/time-slicing spine?

## Current Resolution
Include it only as a short “sidebar” attached to the scalarization-gauge discussion (H4.0a), explicitly labeled as optional and with links to follow-up drafts. The main paper’s spine remains time-slicing + composition; the sidebar is a cross-check that the half-density language also has a nontrivial, dimension-sensitive operator consequence in QFT settings.
