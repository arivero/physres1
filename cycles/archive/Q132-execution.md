# Q132 — Execution

## Verdict: PASS

All claims verified correct:
- Mollifier stationarity integral = 0 exactly at every finite ε (from H2).
- Equal-area law algebraically exact at every polygon step (confirmed in
  cornerstone line 197).
- Half-density normalization as regularity gate: appropriately hedged
  ("playing the role of").

The parallel is genuine, not forced. Counterexample (Fourier series)
confirms non-triviality.

Integration smooth: flows from Remark 2.2's regularity-gate language,
forward-references Section 4.5 correctly. Citation of Nauenberg2003
appropriate.

No fixes needed.
