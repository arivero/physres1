# S55 Execution: Why \(\hbar\), \(c\), \(G\) as Control Parameters (Foundations View)

## Work
- Wrote a blackboard note formulating a "constants as control parameters" viewpoint consistent with the refinement/compatibility thesis:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-why-hbar-c-g-as-control-parameters.md`

## Result
Prepared a `C81` promotion target: add a short heuristic in `paper/main.md` Introduction framing \(\hbar\), \(c\), and \(G\) as parameters controlling three different continuum-limit compatibilities (quantum, relativistic, gravitational).

## Next
- `C81`: promote the minimal heuristic block into `paper/main.md` and record diffstat.
