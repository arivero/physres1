# S222 — Execution: HD-QFT expansion targets (Section 4 deepening)

## Outcome
Sonnet agent studied two candidates for Sections 4–5 expansion:

1. **Candidate A (Van Vleck transport equation)** — SELECTED
   - Van Vleck Δ^{1/2} satisfies ∇_μ(Δ^{1/2} ∇^μ s) = D Δ^{1/2}
   - This makes Δ^{1/2} the geometric half-density Jacobian
   - Explains its appearance in heat kernel expansion
   - Placement: Remark HD-D4.4, after Remark HD-D4.2

2. **Candidate B (Proper-time/Schwinger representation)** — SELECTED
   - Unifies D/2 exponent across identity kernel, heat kernel, propagator, UV divergence
   - Proper-time integral G = ∫ K(t) dt converts t^{-D/2} to Γ(D/2-1)
   - Placement: Remark HD-D4.5, after Remark HD-D4.4

Both candidates strengthen the paper's core thesis without expanding thin boundary sections.
