# Q133 — Debate

## Hard question
Is the "up to constants" hedge acceptable in a quantitative remark?

## Resolution
Yes. The structural claim (convergence condition d<2, critical dimension d=2)
is independent of the multiplicative constant. Explicit factors would add
complexity without changing the conclusion. The proportionality sign is
more honest than writing a specific but non-standard prefactor.
