# D22 Plan: Parallel D-track B — Cross-thread linkage opportunities

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Identify whether threshold-bridge insights should feed other active threads (RG, ordering, half-density) or stay isolated.

## Triage questions
1. Is there a meaningful conceptual link to RCP framing worth future promotion?
2. Are there risks of forced/unnecessary unification?

## Acceptance criteria
- One yes/no recommendation on cross-thread promotion.
- If yes, list one bounded candidate sentence and target section.

## Iteration extension (append-only)
- Produce one concrete <=2 sentence candidate before deciding whether deferral is still justified.

## Policy addendum (session rule)
- D22 follow-ups must not use `paper/notes/`; strategy notes go to blackboard/notebook layers.

## Iteration 3 extension (append-only)
- Add quantitative navigation gate (length + sentence count + novelty window) to filter cross-link candidates.

## Scope re-anchor (2026-02-14, append-only)
- Keep only discovery-valid question: does threshold-bridge material imply a new conceptual relation in the RCP framework?
- Editorial cross-link phrasing/navigation policy is not a D deliverable.

## Closure addendum (2026-02-14)
- D22 closed with discovery verdict: no new conceptual relation beyond existing partition-track framing was established.
