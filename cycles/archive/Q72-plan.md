# Q72 Plan: Referee pass on C117 (Remark PA-D1.3a)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C117`: Promote S79 odd-dimension obstruction classification into Planck-area draft

## Goal
Referee-pass the C117 manuscript changes for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q72-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: does PA-D1.3a stay within the gravity-only scope of PA-D1.3?
- Algebra: verify parity argument, magnitude inequality k < 1 for even d ≥ 6, degenerate d = 2.
- Notation: consistent with PA-D1.3 and §3.3 (PA-D1.6).
- Reader flow: does the remark deepen PA-D1.3 without repeating it?

## Acceptance criteria
- A concrete list of edits to do next, expressed as spawned `S/B/C/D` cycles (not direct edits).
