## Failure modes

### 1. Lost pointers to useful material
- Risk: removing blackboard paths means readers can't find supplementary material.
- Mitigation: the blackboards are internal working notes, not intended for readers. The paper is self-contained — the toy model mention (line 77) and dictionary reference (line 106) were convenience pointers, not essential content.

### 2. Generic "companion notes" phrasing
- Risk: "see the companion notes" is vague for an external reader.
- Mitigation: in a published collection, companion notes would be properly cross-referenced. For a preprint, the vague pointer is appropriate and can be updated in a P cycle.
