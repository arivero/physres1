Verified: for q=2, the stability factor 1+(2-2)γ² = 1 equals γ²ω²
where ω²=1-K²/(c²L²)=1/γ² from Remark 3.2. The identity γ²ω²=1
means unconditional stability at q=2 is equivalent to real precession
at all speeds. Orbital shape (precession) and radial response
(stability) are unified by this invariant.
PROMOTED as C281 (Remark 5.2c).
