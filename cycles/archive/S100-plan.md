# S100 Plan: Moyal product worked examples for Section 7.3
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Add explicit Moyal product computations to Section 7.3 of the cornerstone:
1. f=q, g=p: verify [q,p]_⋆ = iℏ (exact, no higher-order terms).
2. f=q², g=p: verify [q²,p]_⋆ = 2iℏq (first nontrivial commutator).
These make the abstract star-product formula concrete and verify the correspondence principle directly.

## Approach
Add a new Derivation D5.1a after D5.1, showing both computations.
