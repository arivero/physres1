# S156 Execution: Neutrino-mediated forces

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 0 on neutrino-mediated forces: Feinberg-Sucher 1968, 1/r⁵ potential, box diagram, power-law vs Yukawa, contact limit.
2. Reviewed by weak interactions expert: coefficient G_F²/(4π³r⁵) WRONG — should be G_F²/(16π³r⁵), factor of 4 error. 1/r⁵ scaling and mechanism correct.
3. Correction: use V(r) ∝ G_F²/r⁵ without specifying exact prefactor.
