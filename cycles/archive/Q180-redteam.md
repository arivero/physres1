# Q180 Red Team: Referee attacks on C297

Date: 2026-02-14

## Likely referee objections
- "Still too abstract unless tied to one explicit map example."
  - Mitigation: if needed later, add one toy `tau_Q` update map with domain parameter in a follow-up cycle.
- "Could be merged with D10.1a text."
  - Mitigation: keep concise standalone remark to preserve readability and cross-reference visibility.
