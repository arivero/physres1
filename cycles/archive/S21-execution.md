# S21 Execution: Generic-\(q\) Areal-Speed Circular Orbits

## Work Completed
- Derived the circular-orbit condition for \(F=K/r^q\) in terms of areal speed \(\dot A\), including the \(q=3\) special case.
- Recorded the “Compton cancellation exponent” observation: only \(q=2\) gives \(r\propto \hbar/(cM)\) with exponent \(1\) when substituting \(\dot A=cL_P\) with \(L_P^2=G\hbar/c^3\) (4D Planck length).
- Added the Newtonian-dimension link \(q=n-1\) (from Laplacian Green-function scaling), with the \(n=2\) logarithmic exception.
