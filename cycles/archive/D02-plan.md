# D02 Plan: Action–Angle Indeterminacy for Central Potentials (Theme K) → Dependent Note

Date: 2026-02-10

## Goal
Start a follow-up dependent note on the “action–angle indeterminacy” theme for central potentials:
sharp angular momentum/actions imply delocalized conjugate angles; classical orbit pictures require semiclassical packets/superpositions.

This is a discovery/triage cycle only: it must not edit manuscripts.

## Candidate outputs
1. A new dependent note: `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md`.
2. A single explicit derivation witness (Fourier-on-circle / separation-of-variables).
3. One OA anchor for the spherical-harmonic factor \(e^{im\phi}\) (optional but preferred).

## Decision criteria
- Foundations-journal tone and bounded scope (no “angle operator” detours).
- Concrete computation: at least one explicit “uniform \(\phi\)” and “localization requires superposition” witness.
- Clean integration: complements (but does not bloat) `paper/main.md`’s stationary-phase classical-recovery framing.

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/D02-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- `S62`: produce a bounded derivation note with a copyable promotion block.
- `B10` (optional): ingest one OA lecture-note anchor for angular momentum / central potentials.
- `C89`: create the dependent note and build its PDF.
- `Q47`: referee pass on `C89`.

## Acceptance criteria
- One precise novelty claim + scope disclaimer recorded.
- Next cycles are fully specified.
