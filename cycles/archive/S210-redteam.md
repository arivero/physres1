## Failure mode 1: The half-density anomaly connection is trivially standard
Fujikawa (1979) already says "the measure transforms." Restating this
as "the half-density Jacobian" adds terminology, not insight.

**Mitigation**: Acknowledged in the honest verdict. The contribution is
explicitly classified as "conceptual reframing" with no new constraints.

## Failure mode 2: Over-claiming "composition-law defect"
The composition law for bosonic kernels is well-defined; claiming
anomalies as "composition defects" could be misleading if the reader
thinks the bosonic composition law breaks down.

**Mitigation**: The blackboard is clear that bosonic composition is
anomaly-free. The defect is specifically about extending the half-density
framework to fermionic fields while preserving chiral symmetry.

## Failure mode 3: Missing the BV angle
The BV formalism has a deeper half-density story (Costello 2011) that
might produce more than just conceptual reframing.

**Mitigation**: The HD-QFT paper's §7 flags BV as future work. A full
BV analysis is beyond the scope of this study cycle.
