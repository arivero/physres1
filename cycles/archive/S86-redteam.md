## Failure modes
### 1. Reader confusion across papers
- Risk: a reader seeing d in one paper and D in another might think they mean different things.
- Mitigation: each paper is self-contained. The planck-area paper (which bridges both conventions) has an explicit notation remark. Cross-paper readers following the full collection will see the pattern naturally.
