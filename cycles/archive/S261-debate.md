# S261 Debate: Capture conditions across Newton/SR/GR refinement hierarchy

## For promotion

- The paper currently disperses the capture/floor story across four remarks
  in different sections. A single consolidated "ladder" statement in the Outlook
  would give the reader a clear takeaway.
- The three-level progression (no floor -> existence floor -> stability floor)
  is a concrete, quantitative example of "refinement adds constraints." This is
  the paper's thesis in miniature.
- The ratio 2sqrt(3) between SR and GR floors is already computed (Remark 4.3g).
  A forward reference from the Outlook would close the loop.

## Against promotion

- Remark 4.3g already states the ratio and explicitly names the SR threshold.
  A reader who follows the remark chain 3.1a -> 4.3a -> 4.3b -> 4.3g gets
  exactly the same story. Adding a consolidation remark is pedagogically
  redundant.
- The Outlook currently points to *future directions* (field-mediated, spine).
  Inserting a backward-looking summary breaks the rhetorical function of the
  section.
- Page budget is limited (35 lines to 6pp). Every line should earn its place.
- The "parameter count" angle (Observation C from execution) does not survive
  scrutiny: the number of conserved quantities is always 2; only the topology
  of the solution space changes. This would need a more careful formulation
  to avoid being misleading.

## Resolution

The study finds that the capture-threshold ladder is a real and correct
observation, but the paper already communicates it through its remark chain.
No promotion at this time. The observation is recorded here for potential use
if the Outlook is later expanded to include a concrete "refinement spine"
illustration.
