# Q24 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5j

## Goal
Referee-style check after adding implementation note D1.5j.

## Checks
1. Read D1.5b-j end-to-end.
2. Verify D1.5j is concise, operational, and consistent with D1.5i declarations.
3. Guardrail scan on `paper/main.md` for cycle-label leakage.

## Acceptance Tests
- Chain remains coherent and branch-scoped.
- No extra manuscript edits needed, or fixes applied if required.
