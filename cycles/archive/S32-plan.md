# S32 Plan: Extend Minimal-Structure Rule Beyond Circular Orbits

## Goal
Check whether the \(\ell\)-based timelike-structure rule survives for general planar bound motion, not only circular trajectories.

## Scope
1. Derive areal-rate relations for arbitrary planar motion with radial + tangential velocity.
2. Express \(dA/dt\) and \(dA/d\tau\) in terms of specific angular momentum \(\ell\).
3. Identify which conclusions are kinematic (force-independent).

## Acceptance Tests
- Show \(dA/d\tau=\ell/2\) holds kinematically for planar motion.
- Show \(dA/dt=\ell/(2\gamma)\) remains observer/clock dependent.
