# C48 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. The sidebar reads like “proof spacetime is 4D”.
2. It introduces too much curved-geometry notation.
3. It blurs the distinction between configuration dimension \(d\) (QM kernels) and spacetime dimension \(D\) (QFT kernels).

## Mitigations
1. Use explicit caveats: “within conformal rescalings”, “heuristic filter candidate”.
2. Keep to one formula; push details to the follow-up drafts/blackboards.
3. Use \(D\) consistently for spacetime dimension in the sidebar and say so explicitly.
