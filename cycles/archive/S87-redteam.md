## Failure modes
### 1. Reference numbering shift
- Risk: inserting 5 new entries in the References section could disrupt any hardcoded reference numbers.
- Mitigation: the paper uses bracket citation keys (e.g., `[Newton1687]`), not numbered references. Insertion is safe.
### 2. Pourciau2003 is PENDING (paywalled)
- Risk: citing a source we don't have full text for.
- Mitigation: the citation is already in the body text and in the ledger. The reference entry can note the DOI and PENDING status. The citation is for historical scholarship context, not a load-bearing claim.
