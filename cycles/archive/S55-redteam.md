# S55 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Too philosophical**: readers want derivations, not interpretive framing.
2. **Overclaim**: "constants are forced" is too strong; they are imposed by symmetry/empirical input.
3. **Scope creep**: dragging in full quantum gravity or SR/GR derivations.

## Mitigations
1. Keep it to a short heuristic framing and point to existing derivations already in the manuscript.
2. Phrase as: "in this program, these constants play the role of control parameters for limit compatibility."
3. Keep SR/GR details in dependent drafts; the main manuscript remains the refinement/composition spine.
