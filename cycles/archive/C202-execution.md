Promoted quantum state tomography as Remark 6.7 in action-angle Section 6, inserted
before old Remark 6.7 (spin coherent states → 6.8) and old Remark 6.8 (Bargmann → 6.9).
Cross-references updated: Remark 6.9 body (Remarks 6.4–6.8), Remark 7.5 (Remark 6.9
for Bargmann, 6.8 for spin coherent), bibliography entries updated.
Action-angle 167→170 (+3 lines, 11pp).
