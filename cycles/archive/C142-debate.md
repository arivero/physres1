## Hard question
Is D5.1a too elementary?

**Assessment**: No. The computations are elementary but exactly what the section needs. Section 7.3 introduced the Moyal product formula abstractly; now there's a concrete verification that it reproduces canonical commutation relations. The q^n generalization shows the Leibniz rule, connecting to the Poisson bracket at leading order.
