# S56 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overreach**: presenting confinement/string tension as universal or fundamental.
2. **Branch mixing**: conflating "fundamental UV area parameter" with "RG-emergent \(\sigma\)".
3. **Field-theory bloat**: dragging the Planck-area paper into gauge-theory pedagogy.

## Mitigations
1. Phrase as conditional ("if a confining sector exists...") and cite a review for definitions only.
2. Explicitly label the \(\sigma\) option as transmutation/compatibility branch (already separated in `Remark E4a`).
3. Keep to one paragraph plus a citation; no derivations here.
