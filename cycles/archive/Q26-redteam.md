# Q26 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Threshold reification:** readers treat "few-percent" as universal.
2. **Method lock-in:** readers infer Monte Carlo is mandatory instead of one nonlinear option.
3. **Scope creep:** uncertainty caveat grows into a statistics sub-paper inside D1.5.

## Mitigations
1. Keep wording explicitly pragmatic and context-sensitive.
2. Phrase Monte Carlo as a baseline example, not exclusive choice.
3. Keep D1.5 focused on testability logic; defer full inference details to study notes.
