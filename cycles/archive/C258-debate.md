# C258 — Debate

## Why add the Weierstrass–Erdmann second condition?
Without it, the paper's treatment of corners is incomplete. Any referee
familiar with calculus of variations would note that only the first
condition is stated. The second condition is the energy companion.

## Label 3.1b vs 3.1a?
3.1a is already used for Example (No corner for free particle).
3.1b is the natural next suffix for a Remark after the same theorem.
