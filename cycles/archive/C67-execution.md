# C67 Execution: Promote Cross-Dimensional Data-Space Bridge

## Work Completed
- Added `Heuristic H1.8a` to `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` Section 5.8.
- Promoted the S40 message that:
  - compatibility grammar is shared across dimensions,
  - dimensional differences appear in the geometry of flowed data (boundary-data manifold vs effective one-parameter scales).
- Tied the statement explicitly to existing branches:
  - \(1\)D full-line contact family,
  - \(2\)D transmutation scale branch,
  - \(3\)D s-wave scattering-length branch.
