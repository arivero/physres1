# C103 Debate: Where to place the Newton-limit convergence remark?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Should the Nauenberg/Pourciau convergence remark go after P1.1 (the proposition itself) or after H1.1 (the interpretive heuristic)?

## Options
1. After P1.1 (line 207): closer to the mathematical claim about the limit.
2. After H1.1 (line 218): in the interpretive/commentary zone, before the section wrap-up.

## Decision
Option 2: after H1.1.

## Rationale
H1.1 explicitly discusses the relationship between the discrete impulse model and continuous forcing. The convergence debate is about exactly this passage. Placing the remark after the interpretive heuristic keeps the mathematical flow of P1.1 clean while adding scholarly context in the commentary zone where a reader expects discussion. The remark also explicitly references P1.1's hedging language, creating a natural forward link.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- B14 must add the two new bibliography entries to the ledger.
- If a future referee wants more detail on convergence conditions, a dedicated S cycle could expand R1.1 into a subsection.
