# S262 — Debate

## For promotion

1. **Mathematical identity is exact.** The paper's omega^2 = 1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2)
   becomes omega^2 = 1 - alpha^2 Z^2 / k^2 upon quantization of angular
   momentum — this is not an approximation but a literal identification.

2. **Historical significance.** Sommerfeld's 1916 derivation is among the most
   celebrated results in early quantum theory. Pointing out that the paper's
   orbit equation is the same equation elevates the discussion from a classical
   mechanics exercise to a historically grounded physical result.

3. **Adds a concrete physical application.** The paper currently discusses
   gravitational precession (comparing SR to GR Mercury precession). Adding
   the atomic physics application shows the equation's reach across domains.

4. **Compact.** The remark requires only 2-3 sentences. It does not require
   new derivations, just the identification K = Ze^2/(4pi epsilon_0) and
   L = k hbar.

5. **Natural placement.** Follows Remark 3.2a (Bertrand/non-closure), adding
   the physical consequence of the non-closure.

## Against promotion

1. **Scope concern.** The paper is about "Relativistic Central Orbits as
   Refinement-Witnesses." The Sommerfeld connection is about quantum atomic
   physics, which is outside the paper's stated scope (Section 1 says "outside
   the scope of the cornerstone paper").

2. **Potential for overreach.** Saying the orbit equation is the "backbone" of
   the Sommerfeld result could be read as overclaiming. Sommerfeld's derivation
   involved the full machinery of old quantum theory (Wilson-Sommerfeld
   quantization), not just the orbit equation.

3. **Reference burden.** A proper remark should cite Sommerfeld (1916) and
   ideally a modern review. The paper currently has only 2 references.
   Adding references for a brief remark may seem disproportionate.

4. **The "Sommerfeld puzzle" subtlety.** The agreement between Sommerfeld and
   Dirac is now understood to be partially accidental (the role of spin was
   unknown in 1916). Mentioning the connection without this caveat could be
   misleading; including it would make the remark longer than 2-3 sentences.

## Resolution

The mathematical identification is clean and indisputable. The scope concern
is real but manageable: the remark can be framed as a *historical note* showing
that the equation has broader significance, without claiming the paper
contributes to quantum theory. The reference burden is minimal (one citation
suffices). The Sommerfeld puzzle subtlety can be handled with a parenthetical
"(with k -> j + 1/2)" which flags the spin-orbit reinterpretation without
requiring a full discussion.

**Verdict: promote, with careful framing as a historical-connection remark,
not a claim about quantum mechanics.**
