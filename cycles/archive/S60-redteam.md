# S60 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Misinterpretation**: readers think this is a new law rather than a unit-chosen constraint.
2. **Regime mismatch**: Newtonian gravity used where \(v\sim c\) or \(r\sim r_s\).
3. **Dimension drift**: treating 4D Planck units as if they generalize unchanged to other dimensions.

## Mitigations
1. Keep it as a blackboard witness until a clear role in the argument is identified.
2. State explicit consistency bounds (\(M\ll 2m_P\)).
3. If promoted, label it as a "4D algebraic witness" and avoid universality claims.
