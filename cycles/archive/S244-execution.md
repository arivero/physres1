# S244 — Execution
For F=K/r^q, [K] = mass·length^(q+1)/time². At q=2:
[K] = [energy·length] = [angular momentum·velocity], so K/L is a velocity.
For general q, the circular orbit gives K/L = v·r^(q-2); eliminating r
re-introduces m and γ. The identity v=K/L is mass-independent and
γ-independent only at q=2. Drafted Remark 3.1 for promotion in C279.
