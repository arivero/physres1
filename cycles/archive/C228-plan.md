# C228 Plan: Promote QND Measurement Remark

## Objective
Promote S187 blackboard content into Remark 5.7 of action-angle paper (Section 5).

## Scope
- Insert Remark 5.7 after Remark 5.6 (end of Section 5)
- Content: dual QND conditions, back-action on conjugate, dispersive cavity-QED (Rydberg atoms, Ramsey interferometry), Zeno vs. QND distinction, decoherence vs. QND contrast
- Add bibliography entries: BraginskyVorontsovThorne1980, Nogues1999
- Ensure no cycle labels in prose
- No transcript citations

## Methods
1. Copy corrected blackboard text
2. Format as Remark 5.7 with proper sectioning
3. Add cross-references (Remark 5.6, Section 5 measurement trilogy)
4. Insert bibliography entries
5. Run diffstat check
6. Run cycle-tag and transcript leak checks

## Expected Output
Remark 5.7 inserted with 2 new bibliography entries; paper diffstat +8 -0 (approximate).
