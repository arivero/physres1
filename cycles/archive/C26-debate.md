# C26 Debate

## Question
How much of the delta-contact “convention map” belongs in the RG note itself (vs staying in a blackboard), given the risk of drowning the compatibility narrative in factor-checking?

## Working Resolution
Include only:
1. the explicit definitions of \(I_d(E;\Lambda)\) and \(T(E;\Lambda)\) (so factors of \((2\pi)^d\) are fixed), and
2. the two asymptotic formulas (2D and 3D) plus the single sentence “finite subtraction \(\Leftrightarrow\) rescale \(\kappa_\ast\) (hence \(R\))”.

Keep the full antiderivative/SymPy verification in the blackboard note (`blackboards/2026-02-10-delta-convention-map.md`).
