# C65 Debate: Add a New Indicator or Keep Purely Verbal?

## Question
Should the regime dependence of D1.5l stay qualitative, or include a compact quantitative marker?

## Current Resolution
Include a compact marker pair \((\epsilon_{\rm nl},\chi)\):
- it preserves concise prose,
- it avoids a hardcoded universal threshold,
- it gives readers a reproducible calibration handle.
