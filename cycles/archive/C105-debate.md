# C105 Debate: Is H1.2 a heuristic or a derivation?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The symplectic-Euler identification is a mathematical fact, not a heuristic. Should it be labeled `Derivation` instead of `Heuristic`?

## Decision
Keep as `Heuristic`. The identification itself is a fact, but the concluding analogy ("constrained corrections ↔ gauge-invariant counterterms") is a structural bridge, not a proven theorem. The taxonomy definition says Heuristic = "physically motivated bridge that is not presented as full proof." The bridge aspect dominates.

## Rationale
If we split the content — the identification as a Derivation and the analogy as a Heuristic — it would be overly pedantic for one paragraph. The `Heuristic` label correctly signals that the reader should treat the analogy as suggestive rather than rigorous.
