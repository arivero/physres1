## Potential issues
- HD-D4.5 references HD-D5.3 (a later remark). Forward references are
  acceptable in review/synthesis remarks.
- HD-D4.4 cites [DeWitt1965] already in the bibliography. No new citation needed.
- Both remarks are placed between HD-D4.2 and Section 5, which is natural
  since they extend the heat kernel discussion before transitioning to counterterms.
