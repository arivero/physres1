# C284 — Debate

## Remark 3.1b (critical exponent)
Fills a genuine gap: line 82 states the shift q_crit=3→2 as fact but never
explains *why* it is exactly 1. The remark traces it to the degree of the
energy-momentum relation (quadratic → linear). Cost: 3 sentences. The paper
already presents the r→0 asymptotics; the remark interprets them.

## Remark 3.2a (Bertrand)
Connects the precession result ω<1 to a famous classical theorem. The
argument is self-contained for q=2 (ω depends continuously on L → generically
irrational). The Hooke case is mentioned only by name, not derived. Cost:
3 sentences. Risk: a referee might want the Hooke derivation too, but the
remark explicitly scopes to q=2.

## Example 5.2b fix
Unambiguous error: F=K/r (q=1) is not the Hooke force F=kr (q=-1). The fix
is a label change with no mathematical impact.

## Verdict
All three changes are clean, compact, and well-supported by studies S258-S259.
