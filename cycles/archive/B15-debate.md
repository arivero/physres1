# B15 Debate: Is Berkeley's Analyst a real bibliography entry or decoration?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Is citing a 1734 philosophical pamphlet substantive or merely ornamental?

## Current position
Substantive. Berkeley's critique targets exactly the "evanescent quantity" problem that the manuscript's constructive refinement framework addresses. The manuscript already opens with a "Zeno-style refinement paradox" framing (Section 1, line 16) — Berkeley is the historical figure who most sharply articulated this paradox for calculus.

## What would change my mind?
If the citation were being added to a section focused on technical derivations rather than historical/philosophical framing. In a derivation section, a 1734 pamphlet would be ornamental. In the introduction's historical framing, it's a primary source.
