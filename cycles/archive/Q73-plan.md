# Q73 Plan: Referee pass on S80 + S81 — D=4 filter independence and p=1 origin

Date: 2026-02-12

## Scope
Verify that the conclusions of S80 (D(4-D)/4 operator vs integrality sieve: logically independent) and S81 (p=1 selection not from volume half-density) are consistent with the manuscript text in H4.0b, H4.0c, and their cross-references.

## Checks
1. Re-read H4.0b, H4.0c in paper/main.md. Verify claims match S80/S81 findings.
2. Re-read HD-D1.3 in papers/half-density-qft/main.md. Verify D(4-D)/4 derivation is correctly scoped (scalar Laplacian only).
3. Re-read PA-D1.3, PA-D1.3a in papers/planck-area/main.md. Verify the three-obstruction classification (S79→C117) is consistent with S80/S81.
4. Check for any wording in the manuscripts that incorrectly implies the half-density filter selects p=1 or that the operator filter implies the sieve.
5. Verify no orphaned cross-references from recent additions.
