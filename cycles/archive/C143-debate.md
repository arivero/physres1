## Hard question
Is the derivative→renormalization analogy too simple?

**Assessment**: Simplicity is the point. The uncuttable paper's thesis is that "controlled refinement" is the common structure across analysis, classical mechanics, and QFT. The derivative example makes this concrete at the analysis level, and the "higher-order counterterms" remark connects to loop-by-loop renormalization.
