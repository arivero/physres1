# C231 Debate: Remark 1.2 placement and framing

Date: 2026-02-13

## Question
Does placing the Zeno remark between etymological "atomos" (Remark 1.1) and Section 2's toy models create a coherent historical-to-mathematical bridge, or is it an awkward detour?

## Decision
**Placement is correct.** The structure is now:
- Remark 1.1: "atomos" etymology (ancient discrete intuition)
- Remark 1.2: Zeno paradoxes (ancient formulation of refinement-limit tension)
- Section 2: Modern toy models (contemporary formalization)

## Rationale
This arc moves from etymology to concrete paradoxes to rigorous modern mathematics, grounding the reader's intuition for why refinement limits matter.

## Consequences
- Reinforces that the paper's core tension (discrete vs. continuous, finite vs. infinite refinement) is ancient, not modern.
