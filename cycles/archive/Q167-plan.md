# Q167 Plan: Referee review of C283 (Remark 3.1a in relativistic paper)

## Target
`papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`, Remark 3.1a (Newtonian limit: structural cleanliness), line 84-85.

## Review criteria
1. **Content accuracy**: Verify three technical claims:
   - Lorentz factors and \(\sqrt{1-K^2/(c^2L^2)}\) vanish at \(c\to\infty\)
   - Bound \(L>K/c\) relaxes to trivial \(L>0\)
   - Orbit radius \(r=L^2/(Km)\) and binding energy \(mK^2/(2L^2)\) are exact Newtonian forms
2. **Placement**: Check logical flow after Section 3.1 (line ~82), before Remark 3.2
3. **Cross-references**: Verify "refinement-witness viewpoint" connection to Section 1
4. **Guardrails**: No cycle labels, no transcript citations
5. **Duplication**: Does the remark add value beyond what's already stated individually?

## Scope
- Read Remark 3.1a text (line 84-85)
- Check preceding context (Section 3.1, lines 72-82)
- Verify Section 1 content for refinement-witness framing
- Check entire manuscript for cycle labels and transcript citations
- Assess whether the remark synthesizes scattered claims or just repeats them

## Expected outcome
PASS or FAIL with specific technical/structural issues identified.
