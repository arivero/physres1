# S214 Debate: Why D=10,11,26 Are Absent

## Is this worth promoting to a paper remark?

**Pro:** The "parity obstruction" is a clean, computable observation — the monomial
sieve produces even-valued constraints (integer powers of integer-dimensional couplings),
while d/2 for string dimensions is odd or half-integer. This could be noted in 1-2 lines.

**Con:** The Planck-area paper already has PA-H2.6 which states the separation.
Adding another remark risks belaboring the point. The parity observation is cute
but not deep — it's a consequence of dimensional analysis, not a new insight.

**Decision:** Record on blackboard. Do not promote unless the Planck-area paper
gets a dedicated expansion pass. The existing PA-H2.6 + line 184 remark is sufficient.

## Is the worldsheet bridge worth pursuing?

**Pro:** A half-density treatment of the worldsheet + D scalar fields could give a
new derivation of D=26 from the framework's own axioms.

**Con:** This would require incorporating field-content counting, which is a
"Layer 2" operation. It would conflate the two layers that the guardrails
deliberately separate. Also, the standard derivation via Weyl anomaly is
well-established and not in need of re-derivation.

**Decision:** Note as a future direction but do not pursue now.
