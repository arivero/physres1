# S253 — Debate
The broken-geodesic parallel is beautiful but belongs to a different narrative
thread (geometric mechanics / Riemannian variational calculus) than the paper's
focus (distributional / functional-analytic). Adding it would require a citation
(Synge 1960) and geometric setup that doesn't connect to the paper's existing
references. Outlook item 3 correctly identifies this as future work.
