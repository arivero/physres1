# S03 Debate

## Question
Is “analytic in couplings” well-defined for dimensionful couplings without choosing a reference scale \(\mu\), and if not, does that force any physically meaningful H2.5b to be stated in terms of dimensionless couplings \(g(\mu)\) (thereby bringing RG into the hypothesis itself)?

## Working Resolution
Treat analyticity as analyticity in dimensionless couplings at a chosen renormalization scale. Then a \(\mu\)-independent dimensionful constant is only possible (i) when a dimensionful coupling already has the right engineering dimension with nonnegative integer power, or (ii) via non-analytic transmutation (outside H2.5b).
