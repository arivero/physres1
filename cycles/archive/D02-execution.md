# D02 Execution: Action–Angle Indeterminacy for Central Potentials (Theme K)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Decision
- Chosen target: Theme K (action–angle/phase–action indeterminacy in central potentials) as a short dependent note.
- Why now: it is foundations-relevant, self-contained, and directly supports the repo’s repeated distinction “classical orbit pictures come from semiclassical packets, not stationary eigenstates.”

## One-sentence novelty claim (non-manuscript)
In central potentials, \(\phi\) is conjugate to \(L_z\), so an \(L_z\) eigenstate has uniform azimuthal distribution; more generally, sharp actions imply delocalized conjugate angles, and localized orbit-phase/orientation pictures require superpositions.

## Scope disclaimer (non-manuscript)
- Avoid the self-adjoint “angle operator” debate; use the safe Fourier/separation witness.
- Keep the note bounded: one explicit derivation block + one interpretive paragraph; everything else is outlook.

## Updates made
- `docs/research-log.md`: add an entry opening this pipeline and listing `S62/B10/C89/Q47`.

## Spawned cycles (planned)
- `S62`: derivation witness + copyable promotion candidate.
- `B10` (optional but preferred): OA lecture-note anchor for \(e^{im\phi}\) / spherical harmonics.
- `C89`: new dependent note `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md`.
- `Q47`: referee pass on `C89`.
