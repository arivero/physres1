# Q50 Execution: Referee Pass on Editorial Cleanup (C93)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C93`

## Findings
- The removal of “continuation” language improves standalone readability; Section 10 now reads like ordinary appendices rather than draft-history scaffolding.
- The new `## 10.4 Appendix Summary` heading is clearer than “Continuation Outcome” and does not change technical meaning.
- The `[TongQMLectures]` anchor in `Remark D4.2b` is placed naturally and does not introduce any additional claims; it reduces pedantry risk for a standard separation-of-variables statement.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- None.

## Optional follow-ups
- `B12`: if desired later, find a textbook/journal OA anchor for the spherical-harmonic separation statement and swap citations (purely attributional).
