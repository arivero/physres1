# Q138 — Red Team: Referee review of C253

## Attack: "The referee missed that the integral bounds were actually correct"
**Response:** The bounds were correct, but the *explanation* was ambiguous.
The fix clarified "removes the divergent piece" and "small proper times
(large momenta)." The mathematical content was unchanged; the physics
interpretation was sharpened.

## Verdict
Clean review. All substantive issues caught and fixed.
