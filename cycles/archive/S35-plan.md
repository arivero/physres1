# S35 Plan: Minimal Data-Inference Pipeline for \((\mathbf r,\mathbf v)\)

## Goal
Produce a concrete, minimal pipeline turning observational inputs into source-frame \((\mathbf r,\mathbf v)\) for evaluating projected areal-rate postulates.

## Scope
1. Choose one practical perturbed-orbit scenario with standard observables.
2. Write reconstruction formulas for position/velocity vectors.
3. Link outputs directly to D1.5i test quantities.

## Acceptance Tests
- Pipeline includes required input channels and explicit formulas.
- Outputs include \(\dot A_{\mathbf n}\), \(dA_{\mathbf n}/d\tau\), and projected torque residual.
