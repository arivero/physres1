# C115 Debate: Main paper vs companion note for the hierarchy remark?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Should the three-level hierarchy remark go in the main paper (Section 10.5) or in the Planck-area companion note (PA-E5)?

## Decision
Companion note (PA-E5a).

## Rationale
The hierarchy involves PA-H2.13, PA-H2.5, and PA-D1.3 — all concepts defined in the Planck-area draft. Section 10.5 in the main paper is a self-contained appendix computation; adding cross-references to companion-note hypotheses would break its self-containment. The companion note is the natural home for this synthesis because it already discusses both the monomial sieve and the transmutation branch.

The main paper already has the structural gap paragraph (C114, Section 8.4) that distinguishes linear from nonlinear beta. The hierarchy remark extends this into the companion note's framework.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Q70 should verify the cross-references to main-paper blocks (D6.2a-sg, P6.2) and to companion-note blocks (PA-D1.3, PA-H2.5).
