# S273 Debate: Does assumption drift invalidate the bridge entirely?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
If realistic models have running local exponents, should we drop the \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\) bridge from the main narrative?

## Resolution
No. Keep it as a clearly scoped asymptotic comparator and explicitly reject global reinterpretations.
