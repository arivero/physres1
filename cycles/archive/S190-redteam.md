# S190 Red Team: Zeno blackboard failure modes

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes
- Historical inaccuracy (Parmenides vs. Zeno credit): **mitigated** — reviewer caught and reworked framing.
- Anachronistic formalization: **mitigated** — systematic hedging with "in modern terms" and "anachronistic" inserted.
- Stadium paradox missing: **accepted** — dichotomy, Achilles, and arrow cover the discrete-vs-continuous logic; stadium omitted to stay under 1 page.
- The arc is rhetorical, not historical thesis: **this is intentional** — positioned as a historical *frame* for the modern refinement-limit concept, not as historical scholarship. Reviewer approved this positioning.
