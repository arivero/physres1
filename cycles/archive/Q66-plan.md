# Q66 Plan: Referee pass on C111

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Verify Remark D9.1a (quadratic-symbol ordering + half-density bridge) added in C111.

## Checklist
1. Formula: Q_W(fp²) - Q_L(fp²) = -iℏf'p̂ - ¼ℏ²f''
2. Physical application: position-dependent mass claim
3. Half-density claim: conjugation eliminates first-derivative term
4. Cross-reference: HD-D1.3 exists in companion note
5. Notation consistency with surrounding text
6. Placement logic (after D9.1, before P9.1)
7. Guard checks (already verified in C111)
