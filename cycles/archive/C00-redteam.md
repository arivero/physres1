# C00 Red Team

## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. Newtonian historical reconstruction in `C01` must separate direct textual claims from modern reinterpretation.
2. `Derivation D0.1` gives structure but not yet full theorem-level assumptions on function spaces.
3. Distributional products are still deferred and must be regularized explicitly in `C03`.

## Evidence Needed
1. `C01` derivation blocks with explicit geometric assumptions and source quotations/cross-checks.
2. `C02` proof-level Euler-Lagrange derivation and Noether bridge with explicit regularity class.
3. `C03` mollifier-based arguments that avoid undefined singular products.

## Next Cycle Patches
1. Add area-law derivation and modern angular momentum bridge in `C01`.
2. Promote one `Heuristic` bridge to `Derivation` or `Proposition` with explicit assumptions.

## Status Labels
1. Previous `C00` blockers ("no equations", "no source ledger", "no taxonomy in prose") are closed.
2. Remaining items are deferred with explicit owners (`C01`-`C03`).
