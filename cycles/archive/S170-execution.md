# S170 — Execution

## What was done
Wrote blackboard on resurgence and trans-series covering:
- Bender–Wu (1969, 1973) large-order relations for anharmonic oscillator.
- Écalle's resurgent functions and alien derivatives.
- Trans-series structure: perturbative + non-perturbative sectors.
- Borel summability, Stokes lines, lateral resummations.

## Reviewer feedback
Blackboard reviewed by subagent with **mathematical physicist** persona.
Corrections caught:

1. **UV→IR renormalons.** Original text said "UV renormalons on the
   positive Borel axis." Corrected: it is *IR* renormalons that sit on
   the positive real axis and encode power corrections; UV renormalons
   sit on the negative axis.
2. **Sign convention for quartic oscillator.** An erroneous overall sign
   factor in the large-order formula was flagged and removed.
3. **Imprecise "factorial growth rate" language.** Clarified to the
   standard form $a_n \sim A^{-n}\,\Gamma(n+b)$ with explicit
   $A^{-n}$ dependence, not just "$n!$".
4. **Missing Bender–Wu 1973 reference.** Only the 1969 paper was cited;
   the 1973 follow-up (with logarithmic corrections) was missing.

All four corrections incorporated into the blackboard before promotion.
