## Decision
Chose Itô vs Stratonovich over other expansion options (hydrogen atom for action-angle, Gap 2 stationary phase, Gap 4 RG). Reason: the stochastic parallel is a clean, self-contained mathematical example that strengthens the uncuttable satellite's thesis by showing refinement non-uniqueness is universal (not just a quantum mechanics curiosity). It also creates a nice progression: smooth integrands (Section 2, unique limit) → rough stochastic paths (Remark 3.2, prescription-dependent) → quantum paths (Example 3.1, ordering-dependent).
