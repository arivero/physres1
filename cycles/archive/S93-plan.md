# S93 Plan: Action-angle paper content expansion assessment
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
The action-angle paper (74 lines) is the thinnest Tier 1 satellite. Assess whether it can be expanded with at least one of:
1. A quantitative variance/uncertainty computation for the (φ, L_z) pair.
2. A Kepler/Coulomb remark connecting to the radial action.
3. A connection to the cornerstone's refinement/composition narrative.

## Method
Study the paper's current structure, identify the most natural insertion point, and draft candidate content.
