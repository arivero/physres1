# C115 Execution: Promote S77 hierarchy into Planck-area draft (Remark PA-E5a)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Summary
- Added Remark PA-E5a (~9 lines) after PA-E5 in the Planck-area draft.

## Work log
1. Read PA-E5 (lines 302-309) to locate insertion point.
2. Inserted Remark PA-E5a with: half-density dimension match (κ*^{-1} = length^{d/2} for d = 2), three-level hierarchy (semigroup / transmutation / dimension sieve) with witnesses (D6.2a-sg / 2D delta / PA-D1.3), and note that transmutation is dimension-permissive.
3. Ran diffstat.

## Diffstat
```
paper-diffstat (cached): TOTAL +9 -2 (1 files)
  +9 -2 papers/planck-area/main.md
```

## Guard checks (required before finalizing)
- N/A (companion note, not paper/main.md).

## Outputs
- Manuscripts edited:
  - `papers/planck-area/main.md` (Remark PA-E5a, after PA-E5)

## Spawned cycles
- `Q70`: referee pass on C115
