# S207 — Execution

## What was done
1. Read fermionic paper §4 (contact expansion, Remark 4.6 universality),
   §5 (self-adjoint extensions, Examples 5.1–5.2, Remark 5.3 unitarity
   limit), and cornerstone §6 (composition), §8 (RG as refinement).
2. Identified three levels of what RCP adds to standard EFT universality:
   - Level 1: conceptual reframing (unifies PI composition, RG, contact).
   - Level 2: half-density normalization constrains contact expansion
     (reproduces unitarity bound in flat space; open in curved d=4).
   - Level 3: positivity from composition (speculative, unworked).
3. Honest assessment: the gain is primarily conceptual (Level 1), with
   two concrete open avenues (Levels 2–3) that might produce new
   constraints.
4. Overwrote blackboard slot 4 (was adiabatic/Berry phase, promoted
   via C170).

## Blackboard
Slot 4: "RCP + Contact Universality: New Constraints?"

## Open question #3 status
Partially addressed. Updated motivations.md accordingly.
