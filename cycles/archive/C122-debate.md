# C122 Debate: Promote S84 minimal-hypotheses summary

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Does a "meta-remark" about the hypothesis structure belong in the paper, or is it better left for the discussion/outlook?

## Resolution
It belongs in Section 3.1 because that section is explicitly titled "Hypotheses as Separate Knobs (What Is Forced vs Chosen)." The remark directly answers the section's motivating question.
