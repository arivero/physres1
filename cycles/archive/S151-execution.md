# S151 Execution: Cooper pairing as emergent bosonic mediator

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 0 on Cooper pairing: instability, BCS gap ∝ exp(-1/(N(0)|V|)), bosonic condensate, Meissner effect.
2. Reviewer (condensed matter / BCS expert) found:
   - Cooper instability: CORRECT (with caveat: specify "in the Cooper channel").
   - BCS gap formula: CORRECT.
   - Spin 0/1 pairing: CORRECT.
   - Anderson-Higgs effective Lagrangian: CORRECT in spirit but should mention superfluid density n_s explicitly.
   - Photon mass formula m_A ∝ |Δ|/v_F: WRONG — should be m_A ∝ √(n_s e²). Fixed.
   - BEC-BCS crossover: CORRECT.
3. Promoted as Remark 6.1 in fermionic mediators Section 6, replacing thin outlook text.
