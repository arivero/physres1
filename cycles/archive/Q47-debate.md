# Q47 Debate: Is one lecture-note anchor sufficient for this dependent note?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Should the dependent note add more formal citations (angle/phase observables on \(S^1\), Fourier uncertainty on the circle), or is the current “derive in-text + one OA attribution anchor for \(e^{im\phi}\)” approach sufficient?

## Recommendation
Keep the note derivation-first; retain the single OA anchor for the \(e^{im\phi}\) separation-of-variables statement. Add further citations only if a later referee report demands it.
