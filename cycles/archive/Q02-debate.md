# Q02 Debate

## Question
Should we keep adding small “clarifier” heuristics to the Planck-area draft, or does it need a structural reorganization soon to remain readable?

## Working Resolution
Keep adding small clarifiers only while the hypothesis ladder is still being assembled. Once the knobs stabilize, schedule a focused content cycle to compress/linearize Section 3 into a cleaner narrative (likely after `B02` anchors are in place).
