## Failure modes
1. The α-convention error in D4.1b survived the S106 subagent review (pedagogical expositor persona). The subagent caught the label collision (D4.1a→D4.1b) and the derivation gap, but missed the α↔ordering correspondence error. This error was only caught by the Q100 focused referee. Lesson: S-cycle blackboard reviewers focus on pedagogy and derivation gaps; Q-cycle referees focus on correctness of promoted text against established conventions.
2. The error originated in the blackboard scratchwork, which defined Op_α=(1-α)q̂p̂+αp̂q̂ as a self-consistent algebraic convention, then asserted without proof that this α matches the path-integral α. The assertion was false because the path-integral α interpolates between ket/bra eigenvalues, not between q̂p̂/p̂q̂ coefficients.
