# S11 Plan

## Goal
Stabilize the “extremals are distributional” thread with one explicit toy computation showing how \(\delta\) (and, conditionally, \(\delta'\)) arise from weak Euler–Lagrange when paths have corners/jumps or when the Lagrangian has point-supported terms.

## Scope
1. Write a blackboard note with:
   - a piecewise-\(C^1\) path with a corner and the distributional computation of \(\ddot q\),
   - the weak Euler–Lagrange form and the resulting jump condition on momentum,
   - a minimal “delta forcing” example producing a controlled jump (impulse).
2. Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Non-Goals
- No edits to `paper/main.md` in this cycle.
- No bibliography ingestion.

## Acceptance Tests
1. New blackboard note exists in `blackboards/` with at least one explicit distributional computation.
2. Note lists at least one promotion candidate (either `papers/delta-objects/main.md` or the “corners/impulses” thread).
