# S42 Execution: QFT Doubling Bridge in Half-Density Kernel Language

## Work Completed
- Derived the doubled kernel evolution formula for density operators on half-densities:
  \[
  K_{\rho_t}(x,y)=\int_{M\times M} K_t(x,x')\,K_{\rho_0}(x',y')\,\overline{K_t(y,y')}.
  \]
- Interpreted this as the structural origin of bra/ket (forward/backward) doubling at the kernel level.
- Recorded the derivation and promotion candidate in:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-half-density-doubling-density-matrix-kernels.md`.

## Result
Prepared a low-risk, manuscript-ready remark: densities naturally live on \(M\times M\), and half-density kernels keep doubled composition coordinate-free without background measure choices.

## Next Spawn
- `C69`: promote one concise doubling remark into `papers/half-density-qft/main.md`.
