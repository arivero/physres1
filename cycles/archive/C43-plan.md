# C43 Plan

## Goal
Record (durably) the current research steering decision:
avoid BV/BRST detours (known land) and keep focus on quantization as “stationary extremes + refinement-compatible composition”, including the structural need for an action-scale regulator (\(\hbar\)).

## Scope
1. Update `docs/research-state.md` to explicitly deprioritize BV beyond outlook unless later requested.
2. Update `cycles/index.md` next-action queue accordingly.
3. Update `docs/research-log.md`.

## Non-Goals
- No manuscript edits.
- No bibliography ingestion.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `docs/research-state.md` contains an explicit “avoid BV beyond outlook” note.
