# S223 — Execution: Dirac-probes expansion targets

## Outcome
Drafted two additions for dirac-probes-corners-impulses:

1. **Remark 3.1b** (Weierstrass–Erdmann second condition / energy continuity)
   - Companion to Theorem 3.1 (first condition / momentum continuity)
   - H = p·q̇ - L continuous at corner when variations shift corner time
   - Reduces to energy conservation for autonomous L
   - Standard variational result, no deep study needed

2. **Remark 4.3a** (Midpoint kick maximizes action excess)
   - Factor t₀(T-t₀)/T maximized at t₀=T/2, value T/4
   - Physical interpretation: equal leverage on both sides
   - Concrete observation about the already-derived formula
