# S263 — Plan

## Goal
Identify the single best candidate for a third Outlook item in the relativistic
central orbits paper (Section 6), distinct from the existing two items
(field-mediated interaction; refinement-compatibility spine).

## Method
1. Read the full paper to understand the key results: v=K/L, L>K/c bound,
   SR orbit equation with omega^2 = 1 - K^2/(c^2 L^2), precession (1/6 of GR),
   stability criterion 1+(2-q)gamma^2 > 0, q_crit shift 3->2.
2. Evaluate four candidate extensions:
   (a) Sommerfeld/quantum connection
   (b) Post-Newtonian expansion
   (c) Multi-body / reduced mass
   (d) Experimental tests
3. Score each on: distinctness from items 1-2, connection to existing results,
   conciseness, scientific value.
4. Draft the recommended Outlook item (2-3 sentences).

## Deliverable
S263-execution.md with evaluation, recommendation, and draft text.
