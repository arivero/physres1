# C59 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Scope drift:** readers interpret planar extension as full generic-orbit theorem.
2. **Equation density:** extra formulas reduce readability.
3. **Assumption omission:** source-frame and planarity assumptions not explicit.

## Mitigations
1. Keep wording “non-circular planar extension”.
2. Keep remark short and directly tied to D1.5f.
3. Preserve explicit planarity/source-frame language.
