# C77 Debate: Mention Unitarity in the Intro or Keep It Implicit?

## Question
Should the Introduction explicitly mention unitarity as the selection criterion, or leave it implicit as "control map / equivalence"?

## Current Resolution
Include one short clause ("requiring unitarity selects...") because it is a clear, physics-native control condition and it ties directly to the half-density normalization theme.
