## Attack: "You just restated delta-objects content"
**Response:** The Example/Remark are briefer and focused on the bridge
between path-integral normalization (Section 4.5, unique to this paper)
and the renormalization hierarchy. The delta-objects paper focuses on
the kernel-level structure (rank-one operators, half-density composition).

## Verdict: Clean expansion. Section 5.2 is no longer vestigial.
