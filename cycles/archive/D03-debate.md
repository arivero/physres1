# D03 Debate: Is “RCP as a compatibility diagram” new content or just repackaging?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Does making RCP explicit as a closure/commuting-diagram statement add genuine content (in the foundations sense), or is it merely a restatement of standard “consistency under coarse-graining” language?

## Current position
It adds value if (and only if) the diagram is paired with at least one concrete “family of prediction maps” example where:
1) the three operations (partition composition, representation change, scale comparison) are explicitly defined, and
2) the closure requirement is written as an equation that a reader can check in that toy family.

## What would change my mind?
- If the diagram cannot be made operational without importing substantial extra machinery (category theory, BV, heavy RG formalism), then it should remain a short heuristic rather than a promoted “principle.”
- If, after writing the toy example, the diagram reduces to a tautology (pure notation with no constraint), then it is not worth promoting.
