# S87 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Hard question
Should the 5 orphan citations be added to the References section, or should the body citations be removed?
## Resolution
All 5 are substantive scholarly citations (Berkeley for historical context, Nauenberg/Pourciau for convergence debate). They add value and have full bibliographic data in the ledger. Add them to the References section.
