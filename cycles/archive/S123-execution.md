# S123 Execution
Date: 2026-02-13

## Blackboard
Created `blackboards/2026-02-13-symplectic-integrators-refinement.md`: symplectic Verlet = symmetric Trotter, exact symplecticity at every finite N, shadow Hamiltonian, higher-order splittings as counterterm cancellation.

## Review
Subagent (computational physicist): all 5 claims correct (2 with minor caveats — shadow Hamiltonian is formal asymptotic series; uncuttable interpretation is philosophically interpretive). Cleared for promotion.

## Promotion → C164
Remark 3.4 in uncuttable satellite after Remark 3.3.
