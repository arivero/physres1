# C210 — Red Team

- **Critical:** Duistermaat .bib key must point to CPAM 33 (1980) 687, not the old CMP 77 entry. Verify after commit.
- GL(d,Z) notation: confirm d matches the paper's dimension convention (d vs n).
- Quantum lattice defect: ensure phrasing doesn't overstate — it is a semiclassical (EBK) result, not exact.
- No cycle labels in rendered .tex.
