# S43 Plan: Newton-Limit Obstruction Candidates

## Goal
Turn the "Newton limit paradox" long-thinking goal into a concrete list of candidate mathematical obstructions that can be referenced in the manuscript as motivations.

## Scope
1. Enumerate 4-6 candidate obstructions (non-uniqueness, non-existence, divergence, singular probes).
2. Tie each to a toy identity or a locus already present in current drafts.
3. Select one concise promotion target for `C70`.

## Acceptance Tests
- Blackboard note is explicit and non-handwavy.
- Promotion target is small and fits in `paper/main.md` as a labeled heuristic.
