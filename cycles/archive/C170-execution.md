# C170 Execution: Adiabatic limit Remark 3.5 in uncuttable
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
- Added Remark 3.5 (Adiabatic limit: Berry phase as geometric refinement correction) to `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md`
- Inserted after Remark 3.4 (symplectic integrators), before Section 4 (Outlook)
- ~3 lines of flowing text: adiabatic theorem as refinement limit, gap condition as control data, Berry phase as holonomy/connection datum, topological quantization
- PDF rebuilt (6 pages, no change in page count)
