# Q65 Red Team: What could go wrong?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes

- **"The Q pass is too shallow for a single-line citation change"**
  - Response: the pass verified five dimensions (claim accuracy, format, metadata, side effects, guards). For a single-line citation edit, this is thorough.

- **"Both papers are by the same author — should we add an independent source?"**
  - Response: Nauenberg is the primary scholar who identified Newton's scheme as symplectic. Other sources (e.g., Hairer–Lubich–Wanner on symplectic integrators) discuss the method generically but don't trace it to Newton. The Nauenberg papers are the correct primary anchors for the specific historical claim.

- **"The 1994 paper is still PENDING (no OA)"**
  - Response: it was already cited before C110. C110 only added the 2018 paper (which has OA). The PENDING status of the 1994 paper is a pre-existing condition, not introduced by C110.
