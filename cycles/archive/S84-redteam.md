# S84 Red Team: Minimal hypotheses for Planck area

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes

### 1. "Forced" vs "natural" conflation
- Risk: calling PA-H2.1 "forced" is too strong. One could define physics without half-densities (e.g., always work in a fixed coordinate system).
- Mitigation: PA-H2.1 is forced if you want coordinate-independent composition. In a fixed-coordinate formalism, the half-density structure is implicit (hidden in the measure factor). The note says "forced" in the sense of "required for coordinate invariance," which is precise.

### 2. The "minimal set" is a minimal AND set, not OR
- Risk: reader might think any single hypothesis suffices.
- Mitigation: the note explicitly says "each ingredient is necessary: dropping any one defeats the conclusion."

### 3. Open Problem #4 asks for "more than dimensional bookkeeping" — is the answer sharp?
- Risk: the boundary between "bookkeeping" and "physics" is philosophical, not mathematical.
- Mitigation: the note identifies specific claims that are provable (composition forces d/2, three-mechanism obstruction classifies failures) and distinguishes them from conventions (dimensionless f). This is as sharp as one can be without a formal axiomatic framework.
