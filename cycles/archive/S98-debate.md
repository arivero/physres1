## Hard question
Does Section 4.5 overlap with the cornerstone Section 4.4 + 6.1?

**Assessment**: Partially. The cornerstone introduces discrete action (S4.4) and composition (S6.1) separately. This satellite's Section 4.5 connects them through the impulse-matching lens — showing that Theorem 3.2's momentum jumps are the matching conditions at each time-slice, and that classical stationarity imposes Theorem 3.1's corner condition (no impulse). This "distributional → compositional" bridge is new.
