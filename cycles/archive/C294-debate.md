# C294 Debate: Is an exactly solvable quadratic case enough as "nontrivial"?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does the Euclidean harmonic oscillator kernel count as a meaningful nontrivial closure witness for Package A, or is it still too special?

## Options
1. Skip it as too special and chase generic potentials immediately.
2. Promote it as an exact benchmark and keep generic potentials as next-step work.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
An exact quadratic witness gives all-order composition closure with explicit formulas, bridging the gap between free and perturbative cases without overclaiming generic solvability.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Optional next: extend to one controlled anharmonic or Kato-class case via S/C chain.
