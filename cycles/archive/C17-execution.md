# C17 Execution

## Draft Deltas
1. Added `Heuristic H2.13` + `Example E5` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` to make the “dimensional transmutation” branch explicit: RG-invariant scales can supply the half-density normalization constant when analytic monomials in couplings are not available.
2. Rebuilt `papers/planck-area/main.pdf`.

## Status
Completed.
