# C79 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Dimension confusion**: readers mix spatial \(n\) with the paper’s earlier \(d\)/\(D\) conventions.
2. **Overinterpretation**: readers think the statement "selects \(n=3\)" is unconditional rather than conditional on the fixed-areal-speed postulate.
3. **Formula misuse**: \(n=4\) case incorrectly treated by the \(1/(4-n)\) exponent formula.

## Mitigations
1. Keep "spatial \(n\)" and "spacetime \(D=n+1\)" explicit in the same sentence.
2. Leave the conditional context in the surrounding remark (fixed \(\dot A\) postulate).
3. Explicitly name the \(n=4\) case as degenerate where radius drops out.
