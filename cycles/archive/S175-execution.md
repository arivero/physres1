Blackboard 1: Heisenberg limit as metrological face of action-angle tradeoff. δφ≥1/N for linear phase-encoding. F_Q=4Var(Ĵ) quantum Fisher information. Shot-noise 1/√N (coherent) vs Heisenberg 1/N (NOON). Reviewed by quantum metrology specialist: caught 'cannot be surpassed' overstated (only for linear encoding), notation inconsistency, max Var correction.
