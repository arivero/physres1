# C75 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Hypothesis mismatch**: manuscript wording does not match what the reference actually proves.
2. **Overprecision**: adding a citation encourages readers to expect a full measure-theory excursus.
3. **Scope creep**: the Introduction becomes too technical.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the statement minimal and explicitly heuristic; avoid claiming full path-integral rigor.
2. Leave proof sketches in blackboards, not in `paper/main.md`.
3. Keep the heuristic to two sentences and return immediately to the operational moral (controlled refinement).
