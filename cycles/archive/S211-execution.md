# S211 — Execution

## What was done
Analyzed open question #2: can RCP be stated as a minimal axiom set
that DERIVES quantum mechanics?

Read cornerstone §10.3 (P10.1, D10.1a, D10.1, H10.1) and compared
with Atiyah TQFT, Segal CFT, and Costello factorization frameworks.

## Key findings
1. P10.1's three conditions (C, Q, R) map cleanly to a hierarchy:
   C → classical mechanics, C+Q → quantum mechanics, C+Q+R → QFT.
2. Independence sketches: each condition is non-trivially independent.
3. P10.1 is a CLASSIFICATION (organizes existing physics), not a
   DERIVATION (doesn't prove QM from axioms).
4. The derivation gap: composition law is assumed, not derived;
   exponential form e^{iS/ℏ} is motivated but not unique-proof.
5. Closing the gap requires multi-year research program (axiomatizing
   "amplitude," proving uniqueness under composition constraints).
6. Costello (2011) is the closest existing framework.

## Blackboard
Overwrote slot 0 with analysis.

## Verdict
Formalization gap is real but closing it is beyond paper scope.
Current P10.1 + D10.1a is already the best available statement.
No promotion recommended.
