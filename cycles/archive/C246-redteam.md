## Failure mode 1: Remark is too abstract
A referee might say "this is meta-commentary, not a result."

**Mitigation**: The remark is brief (3 lines rendered) and is
explicitly labeled as a structural observation. The paper already
contains Remark 2.2 on hypothesis roles, which is similarly non-
computational.

## Failure mode 2: Nauenberg citation weight
Citing [Nauenberg2003] for the polygon limit might seem heavy-handed
for a parenthetical.

**Mitigation**: Nauenberg is already in the bibliography. The citation
adds credibility to the polygon-convergence claim without lengthening
the text.
