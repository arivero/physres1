# C254 — Plan: Promote S219 into dirac-probes manuscript

## Source: S219

## Insertions
1. **Example 5.2a** (Section 5.2, after line 181): dimensional hierarchy
   d=1 (finite), d=2 (log/transmutation), d=3 (linear/scattering length), d≥4 (no extension).
2. **Remark 5.2b** (Section 5.2, after Example 5.2a): Laplace representation
   G₀(0,0;E) ∝ ∫t^{-d/2}e^{-κ²t}dt links path-integral normalization to
   renormalization thresholds.

## Expected impact
- +6 lines (206→212), stays at 4pp
- No new references needed (Jackiw and AGHKH already cited)
