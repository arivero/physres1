# S222 — Plan: HD-QFT expansion targets (Section 4–5 deepening)

## Goal
Identify and draft content for 1–2 additions to half-density-qft that deepen
the analysis in Sections 4–5. Section 6 (planck-area link) and 7 (BV outlook)
are thin by design and scope-limited; better to strengthen the paper's core.

## Candidates
1. **Remark in Section 4**: Van Vleck determinant as the canonical half-density
   Jacobian — the transport equation `∇_μ(Δ^{1/2} ∇^μ s) = D Δ^{1/2}` makes
   the half-density structure of the heat kernel geometrically transparent.
2. **Remark in Section 5**: Zeta-function regularization and the D/2 exponent —
   the Mellin transform link between heat-kernel `(4πt)^{-D/2}` and propagator
   `Γ(D/2-1)/(4π)^{D/2}` makes the D/2 recurrence explicit.

## Method
Sonnet agent studies the paper + references, drafts text for the best candidate(s).
