# C51 Debate: Should This Be a Paper or Just a Blackboard Note?

SR/GR orbit material is outside the cornerstone thesis and could bloat the project.

## Resolution
Keep it as a dependent draft that is allowed to grow in waves. The cornerstone paper stays focused; this draft becomes the “parking lot” for the relativistic orbit branch.
