# C134 Debate

## Hard question
Is the self-assessment now accurate?
## Resolution
Yes. The paper honestly states: (1) a QM-level explicit computation exists (10.5), (2) a QFT loop computation remains future work, (3) the structural RG framework is demonstrated, not just template-level. This is stronger than before without overclaiming.
