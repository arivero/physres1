# C56 Plan: Promote Covariant Invariant-Candidate Remark

## Goal
Promote S29 into `papers/planck-area/main.md` as a concise invariant-candidate remark after D1.5c.

## Scope
- Add one short section-level remark:
  - define \(\ell\) covariantly (relative to source 4-velocity),
  - connect to \(dA/dt\) and \(dA/d\tau\) in source frame,
  - state resulting inverse-square branch.

## Acceptance Tests
- No overclaiming: framed as candidate/outlook, not proof of universality.
- Includes domain condition \(\ell>GM/c\).
- `cycles/C56-execution.md` logs manuscript diffstat via `scripts/paper-diffstat.sh --cached`.
