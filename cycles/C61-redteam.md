# C61 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Methodological drift:** checklist reads like process guidance instead of physics.
2. **Equation overload:** too much operational detail in a conceptual section.
3. **Ambiguous testing claim:** “falsifiable” used without explicit measurable equation.

## Mitigations
1. Keep wording tied to concrete formulas.
2. Use one compact block with direct equations only.
3. Include projected torque equation as explicit test signal.
