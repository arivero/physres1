# S33 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Silent assumption drift:** readers still read scalar formulas as fully general in 3D.
2. **Notation overload:** introducing vector/bivector symbols without a concrete takeaway.
3. **Overclaim:** implying conservation of \(\boldsymbol\ell\) under generic perturbations.

## Mitigations
1. State explicitly that scalar areal rate needs chosen normal/plane.
2. Keep promoted remark short and directly tied to D1.5g.
3. Separate kinematic identities from conservation claims.
