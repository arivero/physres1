# C290 Plan: Package B closure wave (domain/symmetry witness)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Close the main remaining C289 hardening item by adding an explicit operator-domain/symmetry benchmark to Appendix 10.2.

## Target manuscripts
- `paper/main.md` (yes)
- `papers/<name>/main.md` (no)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add a concrete `S^1` Hilbert-space witness comparing `Q_L` and `Q_W` on a shared domain.
- State explicit symmetry/domain boundary conditions.
- Add one line clarifying normalization convention in `Derivation D8.2a`.

Out of scope:
- New bibliography acquisition.
- Full self-adjointness classification.
- Companion-paper edits.

## Acceptance criteria
- At least one new numbered derivation/remark in Appendix 10.2.
- Domain boundary is explicit (what is shown vs not shown).
- Diffstat recorded in `cycles/C290-execution.md`.
- Guard checks pass.
