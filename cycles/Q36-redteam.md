# Q36 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Reader bounce**: the measure-theory sentence feels too abstract this early.
2. **Misinterpretation**: readers think the paper claims a fully rigorous path-integral measure construction.
3. **Isolation**: H0.2a feels disconnected from the later technical spine.

## Mitigations
1. Keep H0.2a to two sentences and place it immediately after the concrete failure-mode list.
2. Keep explicit "heuristic" labels and return immediately to composition/refinement constructions in later sections.
3. Add, in a later section, one concrete example of scheme non-uniqueness as a companion obstruction (spawned as `S49`).
