# S24 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. Using the wrong \(\gamma\) power in the transverse-force relation (mixing parallel vs perpendicular acceleration formulas).
2. Implicitly assuming a potential exists for the force law without stating it.
3. Mixing the exponent conventions (\(q\) vs \(n\)) across notes.

## Mitigations
1. Explicitly state: for perpendicular acceleration, \(F=\gamma m a_\perp\).
2. Treat \(F(r)\) as given; mention “potential version” as a future extension.
3. Keep \(F=K/r^q\) throughout and note the mapping to dimension only when needed.
