# C170 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Arguments for promotion
- Adiabatic limit is a natural extension of the refinement pattern already established in Remarks 3.1–3.4
- Berry phase as holonomy connects directly to the "extra structure" (connections, half-densities) theme
- Condensed matter theorist subagent reviewed and approved the structural parallel (S129)
- Blackboard error (adiabatic condition) already fixed by reviewer

## Arguments against
- Uncuttable is the shortest satellite (131 lines) — but adding a remark is the right way to expand
- Berry phase is well-known — but the structural framing as "refinement correction" is the novel point
- No bibliography addition — Berry 1984 is not needed for a structural remark that doesn't cite formulas

## Decision
Promote. The remark fits naturally after symplectic integrators (Remark 3.4) and before the Outlook.
