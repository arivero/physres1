# C134 Execution: Update self-assessment for Section 10.5
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
1. **Section 9.4.3** (line 1112): "no full one-loop..." → softened to acknowledge 10.5 provides QM-level computation.
2. **Section 9.5.1** (line 1119): "one field-theory loop..." → "extending the QM witness of 10.5 to QFT."
3. **Section 10.4** (line 1290): expanded summary to mention 10.5 explicitly (divergence, subtraction, running, transmutation, scheme dependence).
