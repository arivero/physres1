# C130 Debate

## Hard question
Should the "refinement-compatibility program" phrasing be more specific about what program is meant?

## Resolution
No. For a companion note, the vague pointer is appropriate. The abstract's final paragraph already explains the connection (contact terms as diagonal-support kernels, scale dependence as compatibility). A reader seeing this paper in the context of the collection will understand; a standalone reader gets enough context from the surrounding sentences.
