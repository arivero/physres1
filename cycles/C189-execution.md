# C189 Execution: Promote Casimir effect remark to fermionic mediators

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Inserted Remark 5.7 after Remark 5.6 (Feshbach resonances), before Section 6 (Outlook).
2. Content: Casimir effect — conducting plates restrict vacuum modes, F/A = -π²ℏc/(240d⁴), no classical source needed, regularization scheme independence echoes cutoff independence of Examples 5.1-5.2, experimentally verified (Lamoreaux 1997, Mohideen and Roy 1998).
3. Built PDF: 8 pages, 153 lines (+2).
