# C232 Debate: Remark 4.11 as capstone and scope control

Date: 2026-02-13

## Question
Is Remark 4.11 (constructive QFT landscape) the right capstone for Section 4, or does it risk opening the door to expanded discussions of mathematical physics that are out of scope for a physics paper on renormalization?

## Decision
**Remark 4.11 is the right capstone.** It directly answers the question posed by Section 4: "Do the refinement limits actually exist?" Confining the answer to a single Remark (not a new subsection) maintains scope discipline.

## Rationale
The remark grounds Section 4's renormalization theory in contemporary mathematics, raising questions without trying to resolve them. This is honest and invites collaboration with mathematical physicists.

## Consequences
- Borel summability connection to Remark 2.5 strengthens cross-referencing without scope creep.
- Balaban mention (Yang-Mills construction) signals contemporary frontier without dwelling on it.
