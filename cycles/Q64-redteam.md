# Q64 Red Team: What a referee would attack in HD-D1.3a

Date: 2026-02-12

## Likely referee objections
- **"The distinction between half-density conjugation and Yamabe is obvious from the weights"**
  - Mitigation: yes, and that's the point — the remark makes it explicit to prevent readers from assuming they coincide. The non-obvious part is the "not xi*R" claim with the specific D/2 residual.
- **"You should give the full derivation, not just state the result"**
  - Mitigation: HD-D1.3 gives the expansion; HD-D1.3a interprets it. The full coefficient verification is in the S72 blackboard. If the paper becomes a submission target, the derivation can be inlined.
- **"The general-metric formula V = |nabla omega|^2 - Delta_g omega is stated without derivation"**
  - Mitigation: this is a standard conjugation formula (e^omega Delta_g e^{-omega}). A one-line derivation hint could be added in a future C cycle if needed, but for a remark this is acceptable.
