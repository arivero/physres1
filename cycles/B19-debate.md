# B19 Debate

## Hard question
Is 4 references enough for a paper touching distribution theory, half-densities, stationary phase, and point interactions?

## Resolution
Yes. The 4 references cover the four main pillars: half-density framework (Bates–Weinstein), distribution theory (Hörmander), point interactions (Albeverio et al.), and semiclassical expansion (Morette). Each section's key claims are either standard textbook material or explicit computations. Additional references (e.g., Reed–Simon, Zworski for microlocal analysis) could strengthen the bibliography but aren't required for the paper's self-contained derivation-first style.
