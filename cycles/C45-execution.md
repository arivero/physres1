# C45 Execution: Conformal Half-Density Laplacian Example in QFT Draft

## Work Completed
- Added a compact worked example to `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` expanding the conjugated Laplacian \(\widetilde\Delta=|g|^{1/4}\Delta_g|g|^{-1/4}\) in a conformally flat metric and noting the D=4 cancellation of the \((\partial\sigma)^2\) term (with explicit caveats and a pointer to the S16 blackboard note).

## Result
The half-density QFT draft now contains a concrete computation that makes the “scalarization gauge” dependence visible and exhibits an independent D=4 simplification in a natural metric class.
