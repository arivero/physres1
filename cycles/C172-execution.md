# C172 Execution: Dimensional contact Remark 5.4 in fermionic mediators
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
- Added Remark 5.4 (Dimensional dependence: from UV-finite to cutoff-dependent extension data)
- Inserted after Remark 5.3 (unitarity limit), before Section 6 (Outlook)
- ~3 lines: d=1 UV-finite extension, d=2 log (marginal), d=3 linear; all need extension theory but UV-finiteness is the distinction
- PDF rebuilt (7 pages, +1 page)
