# S20 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. **Transcript creep:** conversation text is treated as evidence or cited as bibliography.
2. **Scope bloat:** main paper absorbs SR/GR/gauge-theory digressions and loses focus.
3. **Vague backlog:** “we should do X” without file/section targets.

## Mitigations
1. Mark `conv_patched.md` as an idea log only; route any “needs sources” items into explicit `B` tasks.
2. Prefer follow-up drafts for new domains; add only compact, spine-aligned sidebars into `paper/main.md`.
3. For each gap, record: target file, insertion point, and next cycle type.
