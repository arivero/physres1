# Q04 Red Team

## Failure Modes
1. The draft reads like it is redefining QFT, rather than clarifying an already-present but hidden convention (the measure/delta normalization).
2. The “contact terms = delta kernel” remark overstates what is scheme-independent (e.g. “precisely” vs “supported on the diagonal”).
3. The BV outlook paragraph is interpreted as a claim of rigor.

## Mitigations
- Prefer conservative phrasing (“appears as”, “is naturally expressed as”, “kernel supported on the diagonal”).
- If needed, add one short explicit relation between scalar Green functions (defined w.r.t. \(\sqrt{|g|}d^Dx\)) and half-density Green kernels (defined w.r.t. \(d^Dx\)), to make the “convention change” concrete.
- Keep BV to one paragraph and mark it “requires independent anchors”.
