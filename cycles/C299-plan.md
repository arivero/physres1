# C299 Plan: Promote critical-exponent bridge into Section 3.3

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Promote a concise reader-facing bridge in `paper/main.md` connecting Newton and SR central-force critical exponents via the asymptotic rule \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\).

## Target manuscripts
- `paper/main.md` (yes)
- `papers/<name>/main.md` (no)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add one compact remark in Section 3.3 after areal-law universality paragraph.
- Explicitly separate asymptotic threshold mechanism from the independent inverse-square dimensional identity.

Out of scope:
- New bibliography entries.
- Any edits to satellite paper manuscripts.
- Expanding into a long derivation block.

## Acceptance criteria
- Promotion text remains <= one short remark and stays reader-facing.
- No cycle tags or transcript mentions in manuscript.
- Diffstat captured in `cycles/C299-execution.md` after staging.
