## Changes
1. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`
   - Added `Heuristic H1.12` stating the point interaction as a rank-one half-density kernel \(g|0\rangle\langle0|\) with bi-half-density delta form, and separating scalarization conventions from RG-invariant physics.
2. `docs/research-log.md`
   - Added a dated entry recording the promotion.
3. `cycles/index.md`
   - Updated cycle status and next action.

## Status
Completed.
