# D14 Red Team: extend step-halving rooted-tree witness

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Too small for a dedicated promotion wave:
  - Mitigation: bundle (i) notation unification in both manuscripts and (ii) one concise next-term remark with a checkable formula.
- Slips into B-series formalism rabbit holes:
  - Mitigation: keep the scope to a single Taylor expansion + one rooted-tree identification; defer deeper Butcher-group discussion.
- Ambiguous derivative notation remains:
  - Mitigation: adopt one convention everywhere in the witness: \(f'(y)[v]\) for action and \(f'(y)[f(y)]\) in displayed equations.
