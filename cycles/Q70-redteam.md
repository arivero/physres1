# Q70 Red Team: What a referee would attack in PA-E5a

Date: 2026-02-12

## Likely referee objections
- **Objection**: "The three-level hierarchy is presented as a classification, but level 1 (semigroup) and level 2 (transmutation) are witnessed by completely different models (ODE toy vs 2D QM). Is this really a hierarchy or just two separate examples?"
  - Mitigation: The hierarchy is containment-based (semigroup axioms are shared by both), not model-based. P6.2 axioms hold in both settings. The remark correctly states "shared by all refinement flows, including linear beta functions." No change needed.

- **Objection**: "The cross-reference to 'Section 8.4' in the main manuscript is vague — there is no labeled claim there about β order ≥ 2."
  - Mitigation: The statement at main.md line 991 is an explicit paragraph (not a labeled claim) making this point. The reference is to a section, not a labeled block, which is appropriate for an expository paragraph. Acceptable as-is.
