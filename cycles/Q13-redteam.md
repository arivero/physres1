# Q13 Redteam: Likely Referee Critiques

## Likely Critiques
1. “These are standard results”: addressed by framing as a minimal derivation record that connects to the repo’s refinement narrative, not as novelty claims.
2. “Mixed conventions”: mitigated by explicit unit statements and keeping each section self-contained.
3. “Needs stability”: left as an explicit next-wave task.
