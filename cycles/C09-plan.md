# C09 Plan

## Goal
Add a compact worked ordering/discretization pair that preserves classical limit while shifting quantum corrections.

## Scope
1. Choose one classical symbol with two quantization representatives.
2. Compute explicit \(O(\hbar)\) difference.
3. State classical-limit agreement and controlled quantum discrepancy.

## Claims
1. Left and Weyl orderings differ by a calculable \(O(\hbar)\) operator term.
2. Both orderings induce the same classical limit.
3. This concretely realizes the `C04` to `C05` ambiguity-to-equivalence transition.

## Risks
1. Overstating equivalence beyond the worked order.
2. Confusing symbol-level equivalence with full operator-domain equivalence.

## Acceptance Tests
1. Section `10.2` has one labeled derivation and one labeled proposition.
2. Difference formula and classical-limit statement are explicit.
