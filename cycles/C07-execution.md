# C07 Execution

## Manuscript Deltas
1. Replaced section-9 placeholder with a full consolidation section in `paper/main.md`.
2. Added end-to-end compatibility statement (`Proposition P7.1`) linking stationarity, semiclassical concentration, deformation classical limit, and RG consistency.
3. Added explicit transition stress test (`Derivation D7.1`) across all inter-cycle bridges.
4. Added "What is proven vs heuristic" status table with assumptions per segment.
5. Added residual-vulnerability list and explicit next-paper agenda.
6. Marked cycle-sequence completion at manuscript level.

## Equations Added
1. Compatibility equations for weak EL stationarity, semiclassical concentration, deformation limit, and RG invariance.
2. Transition-audit closure equations/invariants, including corner/impulse matching and Poisson-limit relations.

## Sections Touched
1. `paper/main.md`.
2. `cycles/C07-plan.md`.
3. `cycles/C07-debate.md`.
4. `cycles/C07-redteam.md`.
5. `cycles/index.md`.

## Rationale
`C07` closes the roadmap by converting the manuscript from staged construction into an auditable argument with explicit support boundaries and forward technical tasks.

## Acceptance Test Results
1. Section 9 fully authored: passed.
2. Labeled proposition/derivation included: passed.
3. Proven-vs-heuristic map present with assumptions: passed.
4. Roadmap closure reflected in `cycles/index.md`: passed.
