# D28 Debate: Do we need a modern convergence statement at all?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Given the manuscript already hedges “whenever the limit exists”, is it worth spending cycles to state a modern convergence condition for Newton’s polygonal construction?

## Working answer
Yes, but only as a compact scope clarifier. It reduces interpretive ambiguity (“area law is exact at finite step; convergence is a separate analytic issue”) and makes the refinement-compatibility thesis look less like handwaving.

## Next check
Find one clean numerical-analysis theorem that applies to the kick-drift (symplectic Euler) method in the central-force setting, and identify the most relevant singular failure mode.
