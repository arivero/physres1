# Q38 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Intro inflation**: too many parentheticals make the narrative feel like a list.
2. **Scope confusion**: readers think the paper is primarily about measure theory / ordering.
3. **Redundancy**: later sections repeat the same point without new content.

## Mitigations
1. Keep witnesses to one line each; avoid full derivations in the Introduction.
2. Maintain the constructive spine: Newton -> action -> composition -> controls.
3. When later sections revisit the obstructions, ensure they add actual derivations (not restatements).
