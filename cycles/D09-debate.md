# D09 Debate: When is a micro-fix worth a new `C` cycle?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Should we open a new content cycle (`C98`) for a one-sentence clarification when the manuscript is already technically correct?

## Current position
Default “no”: bundle micro-clarifications into the next substantive promotion wave unless the ambiguity is likely to cause immediate misunderstanding or errors downstream.

## What would change my mind?
- A reader-flow failure that predictably generates misinterpretation (e.g. signature/locality confusion that repeatedly reappears in reviews).
