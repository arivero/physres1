# C42 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Changes
1. `paper/main.md`
   - Added one sentence after `Derivation D4.1a` noting that the delta initial condition fixes the remaining normalization constant and forces \(\hbar\) into the prefactor (with the standard flat-space scalar constant given parenthetically).

## Checks
1. Verified manuscript policy: `rg -n 'C[0-9]{2}' paper/main.md` returns no matches.
