# C110 Debate: Should we replace or supplement the 1994 citation?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Should H1.2 cite only Nauenberg 2018 (the paper with explicit "symplectic integrator" language), or both 1994 and 2018?

## Decision
Cite both.

## Rationale
- Nauenberg 1994 has historical priority: first to identify Newton's impulse equations as a canonical/symplectic mapping.
- Nauenberg 2018 makes the modern numerical-analysis connection explicit ("first-order symplectic integrator," discrete energy conservation, time-reversal invariance).
- Dropping the 1994 citation would lose the historical precedence attribution.
- Adding the 2018 citation strengthens the claim by providing a source that uses the exact terminology H1.2 employs.
