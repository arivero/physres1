# S05 Plan

## Goal
Study the delta distribution in the **half-density-first** formalism:
make precise the sense in which the identity operator has a canonical **bi-half-density** Schwartz kernel (a “delta as half-density kernel”), and extract the scaling \(\varepsilon^{-d/2}\) that drives the half-density normalization story.

## Scope
1. Write a new blackboard note that:
   - defines half-densities, bi-half-density kernels, and the identity kernel,
   - derives the coordinate expression of the identity kernel and its transformation law,
   - performs the near-diagonal scaling \(y=x+\varepsilon v\) to exhibit the \(\varepsilon^{-d/2}\) factor,
   - connects this to the “scalarization gauge” choice \(\sigma_\ast\) and to the appearance of a universal \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scale when one insists on dimensionless scalar representatives.

## Non-Goals
- No manuscript edits in this cycle.
- No bibliography ingestion or web search (keep it local + conceptual).

## Acceptance Tests
1. A new dated blackboard note exists in `blackboards/` with the delta/half-density kernel construction and the \(\varepsilon^{-d/2}\) scaling computation.
2. The note lists ≥2 concrete promotion candidates (e.g. one paragraph for `papers/planck-area/main.md`, one for `paper/main.md` or `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`).
