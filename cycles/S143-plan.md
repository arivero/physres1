# S143 Plan: Ehrenfest time and classical correspondence breakdown

Date: 2026-02-13

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md` (potential)

## Scope
Study the Ehrenfest time — the timescale beyond which wavepackets stop tracking classical orbits. For integrable systems, dispersal is algebraic in ℏ; for chaotic systems, logarithmic (t_E ~ (1/λ)ln(1/ℏ)). Blackboard slot 0.
