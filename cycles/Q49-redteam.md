# Q49 Red Team: What a Referee Might Attack (Submission Readiness)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Likely referee objections
- “This reads like an internal draft log in places”:
  - Mitigation: remove any versioning/process language (“earlier continuation version”, “operational note”, etc.).
- “Compatibility principle is still too schematic”:
  - Mitigation: keep the operational closure form and add one explicit in-text pointer to the semigroup-normalization witness (already present).
- “Standard facts stated without attribution”:
  - Mitigation: add a lightweight attribution citation where it reduces pedantry risk (e.g., the \(e^{im\phi}\) separation-of-variables statement in the central-potential remark), while keeping the derivation-first stance.
