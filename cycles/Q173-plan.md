# Q173 Plan: Referee pass on C290 Package B closure

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C290`: Appendix 10.2 domain/symmetry hardening for Package B

## Goal
Referee-pass C290 for mathematical correctness, notation clarity, and scope hygiene.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q173-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `notebooks/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Integration-by-parts identities are correct on periodic domain.
- Symmetry vs self-adjointness scope is not overstated.
- Package-status statement in Section 9.5 matches delivered content.
- No notation collisions introduced.

## Acceptance criteria
- Clear PASS/FAIL with concrete follow-up cycle if needed.
