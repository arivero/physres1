# S299 Plan: RCP Foundations Scope Map + Classical Example

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent: D44

## Goal
Produce scope map for RCP foundations paper + one worked classical mechanics example

## Success criteria (mathematics in blackboard)
**Deliverable 1: Commuting diagram template**
- Partition refinement: coarse → fine (e.g., time steps Δt → Δt/2)
- Representation change: coordinates, gauge, ordering prescription
- Scale transformation: μ₁ → μ₂ (RG), or h-deformation parameter
- Compatibility: "prediction commutes with refinement change"

**Deliverable 2: Minimal axiom list (3-5 axioms)**
- A1: Predictions are refinement-invariant
- A2: Composition law (predictions at combined refinement = composed predictions)
- A3: Identity (trivial refinement = identity map)
- A4 (optional): Locality / causality constraint
- A5 (optional): Dimensional homogeneity

**Deliverable 3: One worked example (classical mechanics)**
- Noether theorem: symmetry → conserved charge (partition invariance)
- Weak Euler-Lagrange: action extrema under partition refinement
- Or: Hamilton's equations as compatibility condition

**Output location:** Blackboard slot 2

## References to check
- Cornerstone Section 10.3 (Proposition P10.1, Derivations D10.1a-b)
- Classical mechanics texts (Arnold, Goldstein) for Noether / variational principles

## Out of scope
- Quantum example (save for C-cycle or later S-cycle)
- RG example (already have toy models in cornerstone)
- Full proofs (keep to theorem statements + one computation)
