# Q13 Plan: Quality Pass on `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`

## Goal
Referee-style pass on the new dependent draft:
- scope discipline (SR + Schwarzschild baseline only),
- notation consistency (units, definitions of \(E,L,\gamma\)),
- no overclaiming (constraints as witnesses, not proofs),
- citation keys present for baseline anchors.

## Checks
1. Read-through of `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`.
2. Quick scan for accidental cycle-label leakage in prose.
3. Verify cited keys exist in `paper/bibliography.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- Draft reads as “two concrete derivations + clear next waves”.
- No confusing convention collisions.
