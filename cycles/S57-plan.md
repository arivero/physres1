# S57 Plan: Decide Whether to Open a Dedicated String-Tension Dependent Draft

## Goal
Make an explicit decision (with rationale) on whether the gauge/string-tension branch has enough multi-wave substance to justify opening `papers/string-tension-as-area-scale/main.md`, or whether it should remain a bounded option inside `papers/planck-area/main.md`.

## Criteria
Open a new paper only if we can immediately provide:
1. a clear scope statement,
2. at least one technical section beyond definitions (not just an outline),
3. at least one OA anchor already in the bibliography ledger.

## Output
- A short blackboard decision memo and an updated next-action item.
