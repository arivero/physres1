# S13 Plan

## Goal
Advance the half-density scale ladder by studying, in arbitrary spacetime dimension \(D\), which *universal* couplings can supply the needed half-density scalarization scale \(\text{length}^{D/2}\) under the “no fractional powers / admissible couplings” sieve (H2.5/H2.7 style):
1. gravity-only (\(G_D\)),
2. string tension / \(\alpha'\) (area scale),
3. cosmological constant \(\Lambda\),
4. mixed combinations (integer powers only).

## Scope
1. Write a blackboard note with explicit dimension equations and the resulting “special dimensions” conditions.
2. Record clear promotion candidates for `papers/planck-area/main.md` (as a new derivation/heuristic block).

## Non-Goals
- No edits to manuscripts in this cycle.
- No bibliography ingestion.

## Acceptance Tests
1. New blackboard note exists in `blackboards/` with the dimension-matching equations.
2. Note outputs at least one crisp selection rule (e.g. “\(D=4\) if gravity-only and integer powers”).
