## Failure Modes to Watch
1. Confusing “dimension bookkeeping” with a physical prediction.
2. Mixing configuration-space dimension with spacetime dimension without labeling it.
3. Sneaking a preferred scale in via an implicit measure choice.

## Mitigations
- Keep a dedicated “what is \(d\)” paragraph in the blackboard note.
- Treat the scale as a hypothesis-dependent input (H2.3–H2.5), not as a forced conclusion.
- Explicitly track where scalarization choices enter (reference half-density vs kernel object).
