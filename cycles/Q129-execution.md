# Q129 — Execution

## Referee findings

### MODERATE
1. "form a one-parameter family in each admissible dimension" is technically
   false for d=1. The full classification of point interactions on R\{0} is
   a U(2) four-parameter family (deficiency indices (2,2)), of which the
   delta subfamily (psi continuous at origin) is one-parameter. The remark's
   parenthetical qualification was correct but the overarching claim was not.
   **Fixed:** changed to "include a distinguished one-parameter family of
   spherically symmetric extensions."

### MINOR
2. Notation 2·2 > d slightly non-standard for Morrey embedding (standard
   is kp > d). Not fixed — any Sobolev-literate reader parses it correctly.

### CORRECT (no action needed)
3. d=1 boundary condition formula: correct.
4. d=2 renormalization formula: correct.
5. d=3 renormalization formula: correct.
6. Green function diagonal singularities: all correct.
7. Heat kernel → resolvent exponent connection: correct.
8. H^2 Sobolev argument: correct.
9. Cross-references to Section 2 and Section 5: appropriate.
10. References [AGHH 2005] and [Derezinski 2024]: appropriate.
