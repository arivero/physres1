# D17 Execution: Critical-exponent bridge target for the main paper

Date: 2026-02-14
Status: Completed

## Actions
1. Evaluated three bounded options for strengthening the central-force generality discussion in the main paper.
2. Chose the compact threshold bridge \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\) as the promotion target.
3. Fixed scope to asymptotic barrier-vs-singularity logic only, explicitly separating it from the independent \(q=2\) dimensional identity.
4. Spawned downstream chain: `S270 -> S271 -> C299 -> Q182`.

## Outcome
- Target is explicit, technically checkable, and small enough for one promotion cycle.
- No bibliography or manuscript edit required at D-stage.
