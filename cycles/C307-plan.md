# C307 Plan: Heat-Kernel Witness to Planck-Area

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Promote heat-kernel witness for D=4 conformal coupling from blackboards/5.md (S283) to planck-area paper.

## Target manuscripts (must edit ≥1)
- `paper/main.md` (no)
- `papers/planck-area/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add remark after PA-H2.6a showing D=4 conformal coupling specialness
- Include a_1 Seeley-DeWitt coefficient vanishing at D=4
- Include five manifestations of D/2 exponent
- Connect to heat-kernel trace and UV structure

Out of scope:
- Full DeWitt-Schwinger expansion (keep in blackboard)
- Detailed conjugation potential computation (keep in blackboard)
- Spectral zeta function details (keep in blackboard)

## Minimum promotion bar (preferably verbose)
This cycle should contain at least one paragraph-level addition/rewrite, a derivation/remark block, or a subsection-level change (avoid micro-edits as standalone `C` cycles).

## Allowed files
- `paper/main.md`
- `papers/*/main.md`
- `cycles/Cxx-*.md`
- (If tracked) `paper/main.tex`, `paper/main.pdf`, `papers/*/main.tex`, `papers/*/main.pdf`

## Forbidden files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`
- `docs/` (log work in `cycles/Cxx-execution.md` instead)

## Acceptance criteria
- At least one manuscript changed (substantively).
- Diffstat recorded in `cycles/Cxx-execution.md`.
- Guard check passes: no cycle IDs in manuscripts.
