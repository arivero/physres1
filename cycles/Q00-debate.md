# Q00 Debate

## Question
What does “PhysRev quality” mean for a foundations-driven manuscript that is intentionally not following standard narratives?

## Notes
- We should treat “quality” as: clarity, correctness, falsifiability/operational content, and precise separation of derived statements vs hypotheses.
- The anti-herd constraint is compatible with PhysRev quality if the paper is *self-contained* and the novelty is stated crisply.
