# D27 Red Team: Odd-\(d\) Scale Supplier

Date: 2026-02-14

## Failure modes
- Turning a dimensional-analysis observation into an unjustified “dimension selection” claim.
- Confusing “fractional powers are ugly” with a mathematically/physically meaningful prohibition.
- Using a scale produced by an arbitrary convention (scheme parameter) and calling it “universal”.

## Mitigations
- Demand an explicit model witness for any claimed scale supplier.
- Keep hypothesis knobs explicit (analyticity, allowed reparametrizations, what counts as a coupling).
- If the conclusion is negative, state it as a *scope boundary* rather than a dramatic claim.
