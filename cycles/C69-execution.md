# C69 Execution: Promote QFT Doubling Bridge Remark

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D4.1` to `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` Section 4.
- Promoted the doubled-kernel identity for density-operator evolution:
  \[
  K_{\rho_t}(x,y)=\int K_t(x,x')K_{\rho_0}(x',y')\overline{K_t(y,y')}.
  \]
- Interpreted this as the kernel-level origin of bra/ket doubling, while keeping the note bibliography-light.
