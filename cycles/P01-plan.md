# P01 Plan: Relativistic Central Orbits preflight -> aiXiv

Date: 2026-02-14

## Target paper
- Path: `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`
- Title: Relativistic Central Orbits as Refinement-Witnesses
- Target server: aiXiv

## Goal
Run publication-mode preflight: generate TeX, compile, verify checks, and log submission readiness.

## Pre-submission checklist
- [x] LaTeX compiles cleanly
- [x] Abstract present
- [x] Categories selected
- [x] No cycle IDs in rendered content
- [x] No `conv_patched` references
- [x] No unresolved load-bearing PENDING citations
- [x] Author attribution line present

## Categories
- Primary: hep-th
- Secondary: math-ph

## Rate-limit check
- Last P cycle: `P00` on 2026-02-13 (7-day spacing policy applies for external submission).

## Note
This cycle is preflight only; external submission is blocked by 7-day cadence and aiXiv account status.
