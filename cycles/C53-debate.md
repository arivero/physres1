# C53 Debate: Do We Need to Cite a Standard Source for the Stability Criterion?

## Question
Should the SR stability inequality for power-law forces be anchored to an external reference, or is it acceptable as a self-contained computation in a dependent note?

## Current Resolution
Treat it as a self-contained witness computation:
- The derivation is short and reproducible, with clear scope (“SR + external scalar potential”).
- Add a citation only if we later claim this criterion is standard or use it as a load-bearing pillar elsewhere.
- If/when we add a citation, prefer an OA review/text that explicitly uses the fixed-\(L\) effective potential method in SR.
