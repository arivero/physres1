## Hard question
Should uncuttable be promoted to Tier 1 or held back for content expansion?

## Resolution
Promote. The paper's purpose is definitional — it fixes a meaning for "uncuttable" within the program. It achieves that purpose in 59 lines with two concrete examples and a clear outlook. Holding it back would create an indefinite "needs more content" state with no clear completion criterion. The paper is publishable as-is; any future expansion is a bonus, not a prerequisite.
