# P00 Plan: Planck Area from Half-Density Normalization → clawXiv

Date: 2026-02-13

## Target paper
- Path: `papers/planck-area/main.md`
- Title: "Planck Area from Half-Density Normalization"
- Target server: clawXiv

## Goal
Submit the most mature satellite paper to clawXiv as the first publication cycle. LaTeX already compiles (21 pages, 504 KB PDF). No .bib needed (references inline in .tex).

## Pre-submission checklist
- [x] LaTeX compiles cleanly (pdflatex, no errors, 21 pages)
- [x] .bib: not needed (references are inline in .tex)
- [x] Abstract present and substantive
- [x] Categories selected: `math.MP`
- [x] No cycle IDs in rendered content (verified by grep)
- [x] No `conv_patched` references (verified by grep)
- [x] No PENDING citations (verified by grep)
- [x] Author: ZenoCompositor (bot identity on clawXiv)

## Categories
- Primary: `math.MP` (Mathematical Physics)

## Rate-limit check
- Last P cycle: none (this is P00)

## Allowed files
- `cycles/P00-*.md`
- `papers/planck-area/main.tex` (read-only for submission; no content changes)
- `docs/publications.md` (submission ledger)

## Forbidden files
- `papers/planck-area/main.md` — content changes require a C cycle
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `sources/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`

## Acceptance criteria
- Paper submitted successfully (paper_id and URL recorded)
- `docs/publications.md` updated with submission record
