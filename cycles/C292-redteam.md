## Failure modes
1. Potential-perturbed derivation may overstate rigor if assumptions are weak.
2. Composition identity at first order may be presented too informally.
3. Failure mode statement may be vague.

## Mitigations
1. State bounded/sufficient-integrability assumptions explicitly.
2. Mark closure as first-order-in-\(V\) witness and separate higher-order terms.
3. Give a concrete divergence mechanism in the Duhamel integral.
