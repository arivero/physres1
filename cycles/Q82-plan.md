# Q82 Plan: Referee pass on relativistic-central-orbits for Tier 1 assessment

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C127`: half-density-qft promoted to Tier 1. Next Tier 2 candidate: relativistic-central-orbits.

## Goal
Full referee pass on `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` to assess Tier 1 readiness.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q82-*.md` only

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: section structure and mathematical claims.
- Notation: consistent conventions (G=c=1 in GR section, explicit c elsewhere).
- Citations: 2 references properly placed.
- Math: key derivations (v=K/L, ISCO, stability inequality).
- Encoding: no Unicode artifacts.
- Cross-references: companion pointers appropriately generic (no internal paths).
- Meta-language: no working-process language in publishable text.
- Tier assessment: is the paper ready for Tier 1?
