# S128 Execution

## Blackboard
Wrote blackboard slot 3: Husimi function for action-angle visualization.
5 claims: definition, Fock formula (ring), coherent formula (blob), diagnostic value, why Husimi not Wigner.
## Reviewer feedback (quantum optics experimentalist — edited blackboard directly)
All 5 claims CORRECT. Claim 4 had terminology issue: "number-squeezed/phase-squeezed" confused with standard quadrature-squeezed states. Reviewer fixed to "narrow Fock superposition" and "angular coherent superposition" with clarifying note. Formulas match experimental reality.
