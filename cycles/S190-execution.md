# S190 Execution: Zeno's paradoxes blackboard for uncuttable paper

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work performed
- Wrote blackboard 0 mapping Zeno's dichotomy, Achilles/tortoise, and arrow paradoxes to proto-refinement limits.
- Reviewed by historian-of-mathematics persona.
- Applied 2 HIGH corrections: Parmenides' monism framing (reworded), anachronistic series formalization (hedged with "in modern terms").
- Applied 3 MEDIUM corrections: arrow paradox nuance (distinguished instant/process), "perfectly frames" softened to "suggestively parallels", "by fiat" softened to "invokes".

## Artifacts produced
- `blackboards/0-zeno-paradoxes-proto-refinement.md`: Zeno dichotomy/Achilles/arrow as proto-refinement limits

## Result
- Blackboard is now historicially grounded and promotion-ready for Remark 1.2 in uncuttable paper.

## Promotion candidate (copyable block)
See `blackboards/0-zeno-paradoxes-proto-refinement.md` for the final remark text.

## Discovery flag (fill at end of cycle)
- Did this computation reveal something unexpected? **no**
- The connection is suggestive but not surprising given the problem domain.

## Spawned cycles
- `C231`: promote the blackboard into uncuttable Remark 1.2
