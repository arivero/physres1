# Q62 Plan: Referee pass on C107 (H4.0c insertion)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Referee-style review of the C107 diff: the insertion of Heuristic H4.0c (RG-side echo of the conformal half-density D=4 cancellation) into `paper/main.md` Section 6.

## Parent cycle
`C107` (commit `0590a09`)

## Checklist
1. Correctness of each factual claim in H4.0c.
2. Label consistency (H4.0c fits the H4.0x sequence; no collision with companions).
3. Placement and reader flow (between H4.0b and D4.1).
4. Forward-reference hygiene (mentions RG before Section 8).
5. Guard checks (no cycle tags, no transcript mentions).
