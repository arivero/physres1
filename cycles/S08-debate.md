# S08 Debate

## Question
Is the Van Vleck determinant exactly the same object as \(\det(\mathrm{Hess}\,f)\) in stationary phase, or only analogous?

## Working Resolution
Treat it as “the same structural role” rather than identical in every coordinate choice:
stationary phase uses the Hessian of the phase with respect to integration variables; the semiclassical propagator involves a mixed second-derivative determinant that arises after eliminating intermediate variables and is related to the Hessian through Schur complements/Jacobi fields. Keep the note explicit about what is shown vs what is only structural analogy.
