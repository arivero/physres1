# Q14 Debate: Do Diffstats Incentivize Noise?

## Question
Does requiring line-added/removed counts for every `C` cycle risk encouraging low-value edits just to avoid `TOTAL +0 -0`?

## Current Resolution
Use diffstat as an **accountability signal**, not a quality metric:
- It forces us to admit when a `C` cycle produced no manuscript promotion.
- Quality remains governed by `Q` passes (scope/claims/clarity), not by line counts.
- If a cycle cannot responsibly promote text, it should say so and spawn `S`/`B` work rather than “padding” prose.
