## Failure Modes
1. Turning H2.5 into a semantic debate with no actionable rule.
2. Mixing the “coupling admissibility” filter with unrelated special-dimension filters (SUSY/division algebras/etc).
3. Accidentally treating scheme parameters (\(\mu\), cutoff \(\Lambda\)) as “couplings”, making the sieve vacuous.

## Mitigations
- End with a crisp proposed rule (even if tentative) and list what it excludes.
- Keep explicit examples: gravity-only, gravity+\(\Lambda_d\), gravity+\(\alpha'\).
- Keep RG/transmutation as a *separate* branch, not an amendment to H2.5.
