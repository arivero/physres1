# S171 — Debate

## Summary
The string-theorist reviewer's four corrections were all valid and
incorporated without dispute:

- **SL(2,ℤ):** The full duality group includes $T: \tau \mapsto \tau+1$
  (shift of theta angle) as well as $S: \tau \mapsto -1/\tau$. Writing
  only $g \leftrightarrow 1/g$ misses the richer structure and would
  signal unfamiliarity to any expert reader.
- **N=4 conjecture status:** Despite overwhelming evidence (Vafa–Witten,
  BPS counting, AGT), S-duality in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM remains a
  conjecture. Overstating it invites easy criticism.
- **Refinement framing:** "Multiple descriptions of the same limit
  object" is a weaker but more honest claim than asserting a formal
  "refinement equivalence" without defining the category.
- **UV/IR + asymptotic safety:** The dropped paragraph was speculative
  with no argument. Better to omit than to hand a referee an easy target.

No disagreements. All corrections applied before promotion in C212.
