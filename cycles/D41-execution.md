# D41 Execution: Rooted-Tree Bookkeeping Paper Scoping

Date: 2026-02-14

## Decision
Start new satellite paper: "Rooted Trees as Bookkeeping" (Butcher ↔ RG dictionary)

## One-sentence novelty claim
Make Butcher/RG tree correspondence explicit via worked examples on both sides, clarifying where it's literal equivalence vs analogy.

## Scope verdict
**Minimal (6-9pp):** Dictionary table + midpoint RK2 example + 1-loop RG toy model
**Extended (9-13pp PRD):** Add symplectic RK + 2-loop or Hopf coproduct

## Mathematics delivered
Blackboard slot 0 (S297):
- 7-entry dictionary table (B-series ↔ counterterms, grafting ↔ subdivergences, etc.)
- Worked midpoint RK2 example (trees up to order 2, composition test)
- Scope map for paper sections

## Spawned cycles
- S297 (completed): scope map + Butcher example
- C315 (next): draft initial paper structure

## Updates made
- None needed in research-state.md yet (new satellite, not listed)
- Will update cycles/index.md after C315
