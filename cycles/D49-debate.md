# D49 Debate: P4.2 ↔ RCP Axiom Mapping

## Main claim
P4.2 is exactly the partition-channel content of A1+A2+A5. The three RCP channels are operationally orthogonal.

## For
- The mapping is clean: no hypothesis is left unmapped, no axiom is unused within its channel
- The per-axiom decomposition (Section 3) reveals A1 as the "master axiom" — it alone forces d/2, exponential weight, and iε
- A3 and A4 address genuinely different physics (ordering, RG) that P4.2 never touches
- This supports the claim that RCP is irreducible to any single theorem

## Against / caveats
- The "bijection at partition level" is only exact under a specific reading of "partition channel restriction." If one reads A1 more broadly (e.g., including spatial composition), the mapping becomes less tight.
- A5 being "optional" in the axiom list (as marked in the RCP paper) while being essential for P4.2's strongest conclusions (κ=ℏ, Lévy obstruction, continuum time) creates a tension: is A5 really optional?
- The orthogonality of channels is clean in principle but may break in practice: e.g., singular potentials require both A3 (self-adjoint extension) and A4 (RG flow) simultaneously. Is there a "cross-channel" axiom needed?

## Resolution
The caveats are valid but don't invalidate the mapping. A5's optionality should be reconsidered in light of this analysis. Cross-channel interactions (e.g., singular potentials needing both A3 and A4) are handled by the commuting-diagram structure (Section 2.2 of RCP paper), not by new axioms.
