# C314 Plan: Continuum-time forcing from dimensional homogeneity

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Promote D40/S296's discovery (dimensional obstruction to discrete time) into cornerstone Section 10 as a P4.2 extension remark.

## Target manuscripts
- `paper/main.md` (yes) — Section 10, near P4.2 remarks

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Remark P4.2g: dimensional homogeneity (D) forces continuum time parameter, not just action scale κ
- Core result: lattice spacing ε cannot be derived from {m, ℏ} in non-relativistic QM (dimensional obstruction)
- Impact: P4.2 inevitability thesis extends — composition + (D) force BOTH ℏ (action scale) AND continuous t

Out of scope:
- Relativistic extensions (Compton time requires c)
- Lattice QFT validity discussion (scope disclaimer already in D40)

## Minimum promotion bar
Add Remark P4.2g (~8-12 lines): state dimensional obstruction, give two-line algebraic proof ([ε]=T requires b=0 from L, b=−1 from T → contradiction), state conclusion (continuum forced).

## Allowed files
- `paper/main.md`

## Acceptance criteria
- Remark P4.2g added to Section 10

- Guard check passes (no cycle IDs)
- Blackboard slot 0 marked as promoted
