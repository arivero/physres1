# S53 Execution: Generic-\(q\) Areal-Speed Scaling and Dimension Selection

## Work
- Wrote a self-contained derivation note expanding the generic \(F=K/r^q\) scaling and its spatial-dimension specialization:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-areal-speed-scaling-by-dimension.md`

## Result
Prepared a `C79` promotion target: modestly tighten `Remark D1.5a` in `papers/planck-area/main.md` to:
- highlight the \(n\)-spatial-dimension dependence \(q=n-1\) (and \(n=2\) log exception),
- and emphasize that the \(G\)-cancellation and linear Compton scaling are uniquely \(n=3\) (spacetime \(D=4\)).

## Next
- `C79`: apply the small `Remark D1.5a` wording improvement and record diffstat.
