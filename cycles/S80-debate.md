# S80 Debate: Is calling this a "cross-leg consistency check" within RCP overstating the case?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The analysis maps the sieve to the scale-compatibility leg and the operator to the representation-compatibility leg of RCP. But is this mapping rigorous, or is it a loose analogy?

## Recommendation
The mapping is structurally grounded but informal. The sieve (PA-D1.3) is about what scales are available in the theory — directly tied to RG/scale compatibility. The operator simplification (H4.0b) is about how kinetic operators depend on scalarization/ordering choices — directly tied to representation compatibility (Section 10.2). These are different legs of P10.1. The claim that their agreement at D=4 is a "cross-leg check" is a structural observation, not a formal theorem. This is the appropriate level for a heuristic (H4.0c already frames it this way). No change needed.
