# C105 Red Team: promotion risks

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes
- **Berkeley citation is ornamental:**
  - Risk: adding a 1734 pamphlet citation to a physics paper might seem out of place.
  - Mitigation: the citation is one clause, not a paragraph. It grounds the "Zeno-style refinement paradox" phrase in its actual historical origin. Ornamental would be quoting Berkeley at length.

- **H1.2 oversells the symplectic ↔ gauge analogy:**
  - Risk: "constrained corrections ↔ gauge-invariant counterterms" is an analogy, not a theorem.
  - Mitigation: labeled as Heuristic. Phrased as "a finite-step analogue of the principle that..." (analogy language, not identity language).

- **H1.2 label collision with companion:**
  - Risk: the companion (rg-fundamental) also has a label H1.2.
  - Status: known issue from Q59 (label namespace collision). Deferred until submission preparation.

- **Missing Nauenberg (1994) citation in H1.2:**
  - Risk: Nauenberg (1994) is the source that identifies the symplectic structure; not citing it is an attribution gap.
  - Status: Nauenberg (1994) is not yet in the bibliography (B13 identified it but B14 only added Nauenberg 2003). A future B16 could add it, or the next Q cycle can flag this.
