# S303 Plan: Formalize P4.2 minimal hypotheses

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent: D50

## Goal
Write a precise mathematical statement of P4.2 with the minimal hypothesis set
(C)+(I)+"action-based setup", clarifying what each hypothesis contributes.
This formalizes the D50 finding that (D) is derivable.

## Deliverable
Blackboard slot 0 (or append to notebook): precise Theorem P4.2' with
explicit axiom attribution for each conclusion.

## Method
1. Review the original P4.2 statement (cornerstone line 611)
2. Write the revised statement with (C)+(I)+Setup
3. Mark each conclusion with its axiom source
4. Identify if the revised statement is publishable-quality
