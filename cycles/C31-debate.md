# C31 Debate

## Question
Should this be promoted into the main paper now (near D4.3), or kept as a `paper/notes/` lemma until the semiclassical bibliography anchor (`B02`) is unblocked?

## Working Resolution
Keep it in `paper/notes/` for now. Once `B02` is available, consider adding a one-sentence pointer near D4.3 or in an appendix-style subsection.
