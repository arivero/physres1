# S139 Debate: Real spherical harmonics

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Real harmonics are the simplest possible angle-localization witness: just two-mode superposition of m and -m.
- The directional lobes (p_x, d_{xy}, etc.) are ubiquitous in chemistry but rarely framed as uncertainty tradeoff.
- Phase convention (Condon-Shortley vs. Racah) matters for explicit formulas but not for the physical content.
- Reviewer confirmed: excellent fit for Section 3 (after main azimuthal uniformity statement).
