# S45 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Conflation:** treating emergent \(\sigma\) as a fundamental constant on par with \(\alpha'\) or \(L_P^2\).
2. **Bibliography debt:** implying Wilson-loop/area-law results without anchors.
3. **Filter mixing:** using string tension to "select dimensions" while also using it as transmutation output.

## Mitigations
1. State explicitly: \(\sigma\) is RG-generated in \(d=4\) if the coupling is dimensionless.
2. Keep promoted remark purely logical (branch placement), not a detailed confinement review.
3. Keep E4 (UV input) and H2.13 (transmutation) as separate hypothesis branches.
