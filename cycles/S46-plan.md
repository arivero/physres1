# S46 Plan: "Uncuttable" Clarification

## Goal
Define "uncuttable" in the intended Democritean/calculus sense used in the conversation backlog: finite cuts do not determine the value without a controlled refinement rule.

## Scope
1. Write a project-internal definition that avoids the indivisibility misread.
2. Tie it to the repo's refinement-compatibility thesis.
3. Choose a safe promotion target (prefer a dependent note, not the core manuscript).

## Acceptance Tests
- Definition is short, precise, and non-historical.
- Promotion target avoids adding bibliography debt to `paper/main.md`.
