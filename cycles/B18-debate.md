# B18 Debate

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is Bates-Weinstein the right primary anchor for half-density kernels, or should we cite Woodhouse "Geometric Quantization" instead?

## Resolution
Bates-Weinstein is preferable for three reasons:
1. It is freely available OA from the author's website.
2. It is more focused (lecture notes vs full textbook) and more accessible.
3. It covers exactly the half-density/kernel material needed (Chapter 7 of their notes).
Woodhouse could be added as an optional secondary reference in a future B cycle, but is not needed for the paper's current claims.
