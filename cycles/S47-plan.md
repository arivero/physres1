# S47 Plan: Crisp Obstruction Lemma for the "Newton-Limit Paradox"

## Goal
Sharpen one candidate obstruction from `blackboards/2026-02-10-newton-limit-obstruction-candidates.md` into a lemma-like mathematical statement that can be quoted (as a heuristic) in `paper/main.md` to justify why naive refinement-to-zero reasoning needs extra structure.

Primary target: "no Lebesgue measure on infinite-dimensional path space" (measure-theoretic obstruction).

## Tasks
1. Write a clean lemma statement for infinite-dimensional Banach spaces: translation-invariant + locally finite Borel measures are trivial.
2. Give a short proof sketch (packing disjoint translates).
3. Record the operational relevance for kernels/path integrals: `Dφ` cannot be treated as an ordinary measure, so refinement/normalization becomes definitional.

## Acceptance Tests
- The lemma is stated without overclaiming ("QM is forced"), only as an obstruction to naive measure-based refinement.
- A nontechnical paragraph links the lemma to the manuscript thesis (composition/refinement requires control data).
- A clear promotion target for `C74` is written (where to insert + 2-3 sentences max).
