# Q06 Debate

## Question
Should the RG draft commit to a single “standard scattering length” normalization (e.g. the conventional \(4\pi\hbar^2/m\) factor in 3D), or keep the current “up to conventions” stance?

## Working Resolution
Keep “up to conventions” for now; the draft’s goal is structural compatibility/RG, not matching any one community’s \(T\)-matrix normalization.
