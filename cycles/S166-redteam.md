# S166 Red Team: Zeta regularization study failure modes

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes
- Overclaiming the string theory connection beyond what is standard:
  - Mitigation: cite Hawking (1977) and keep wording to "well-known application."
- Confusing analytic continuation with summation:
  - Mitigation: use "regularized value" phrasing, not "equals."
