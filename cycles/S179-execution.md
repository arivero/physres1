# S179 Execution
Blackboard 1: Kadanoff block-spin transformation as real-space RG prototype. Reviewed by condensed matter expert: caught (1) rescaling direction wrong (a→ab should be spacing ba then rescale by 1/b), (2) Wilson described as mere 'quantitative implementation' — understates his contribution, (3) 'average' not well-defined for Ising spins.
