# C47 Debate: Keep Contact-Term Algebra in QFT Draft or Split a New Note?

## Hard Question
Does adding Lie-derivative identities to the QFT half-density draft complicate it too much?

## Current Resolution
Add only the minimal kernel algebra needed to make the “derivative counterterms = derivatives of the diagonal delta” claim precise, and push all detail to the S18 blackboard note.
