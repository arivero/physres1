# C92 Debate: Keep or remove internal “process metadata” from the manuscript?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Should the manuscript include internal process metadata (e.g., local-ingest status of sources), or should that information live only in the bibliography ledger and cycle logs?

## Decision
Remove process metadata from the rendered manuscript.

## Rationale
The submission draft should read as a standalone paper. Acquisition/ingest status is operational and belongs in `paper/bibliography.md` (ledger) and cycle artifacts, not in journal-visible prose.
