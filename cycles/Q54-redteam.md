# Q54 Red Team: Likely referee objections to C97 edits

Date: 2026-02-11

## Likely referee objections
- “The Gaussian witness assumes Euclidean structure; does this generalize on a manifold?”
  - Mitigation: add one sentence clarifying it is a local coordinate-patch normalization witness (spawn `C98` if needed).
- “The \(D=4\) cancellation sounds like a dimension-selection claim.”
  - Mitigation: keep the scope disclaimer (already present); avoid interpretive language elsewhere in the note.
