# Q87 Debate

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is this paper publishable even after fixes, or is it too definitional?

## Resolution
It's borderline. The paper defines a term and gives two examples. For a standalone preprint, this is thin — a referee would likely ask "what is the theorem?" The paper's value is as a conceptual anchor within the collection, not as an independent contribution. For Tier 1 (preprint-ready), it would benefit from at least one section showing how the definition produces a concrete, non-trivial consequence (e.g., that the ε^{-d/2} scaling of half-density kernels is exactly the "comparison structure" required by the definition).
