# B04 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. Choosing a reference that is not actually OA-accessible in this environment.
2. Adding a bibliography item that doesn’t support the specific claim (semigroup/coarse-graining flow).
3. Turning the citation into a “herd-following” rewrite of the standard RG story.

## Mitigations
1. Use an arXiv-anchored review with journal/DOI metadata.
2. Spot-check the ingested source for explicit coarse-graining/flow/semigroup statements.
3. Keep the manuscript text derivation-first; the citation is an anchor only.
