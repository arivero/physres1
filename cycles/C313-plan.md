# C313 Plan — Planck-Area Odd-d Witness Closure + Cornerstone Section 7 Deformation Pointer

## Goal
Promote two stabilized results into manuscripts:

1. **Planck-area paper** (`papers/planck-area/main.md`): Close Open Problem #3 ("An explicit odd-d transmutation witness is still open") by marking it addressed with a forward reference to Remark PA-D1.3b (already present) and the d=3 scattering-length witness from notebook/blackboard 0.

2. **Cornerstone paper** (`paper/main.md`): Add a brief remark in Section 7.4 (after P5.2) noting that the deformation equivalence is not merely formal but physical — the energy-shift estimate shows different orderings agree to unmeasurable precision. This cross-links to the four-layer stratification already in D9.1a.

## Sources
- Blackboard 0 (D27/S284): Parity lemma + d=3 witness
- Notebook `odd-d-scalarization-parity.md`: Consolidated version
- Notebook `deformation-equivalence-physical.md`: Four-layer + observability
- Blackboard 6 (D38/S294): Energy shift formula

## Acceptance Criteria
1. planck-area Open Problem #3 updated to "(Addressed: ...)" with d=3 witness citation
2. Cornerstone Section 7.4 or 7.5 has a short remark connecting P5.2 to the physical observability test
3. No cycle IDs in manuscript text
4. Diffstat shows net positive additions in both manuscripts

## Page Limit Check
- Planck-area is 14pp (PRD-length, no PLB cap constraint). Small additions OK.
- Cornerstone is 23pp (Physics Reports target). Small additions OK.
