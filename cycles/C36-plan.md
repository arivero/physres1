# C36 Plan

## Goal
Make a small wording/clarity improvement to `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` (wave 1):
1. soften “counterterms/contact terms are precisely diagonal \(\delta(x-y)\)” to conservative “diagonal-supported distributions” phrasing,
2. add a one-line explicit relation between the usual scalar Green function (defined with the \(\sqrt{|g|}\,d^Dx\) pairing) and the half-density Green kernel (defined with the \(d^Dx\) pairing).

## Scope
1. Edit `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` (micro-edits only; keep wave-1 size).
2. Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Non-Goals
- No bibliography ingestion.
- No edits to `paper/main.md` in this cycle.

## Acceptance Tests
1. Abstract no longer overstates scheme-independence (“precisely” softened).
2. Section 4 contains an explicit formula relating scalar and half-density Green functions.
