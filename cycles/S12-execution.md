# S12 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Work
1. Added `blackboards/2026-02-10-contact-loop-integrals-1d-2d-3d.md` recording explicit cutoff formulas and asymptotics for \(I_d(E;\Lambda)\) in \(d=1,2,3\).

## Result
We now have a compact “dimension table” for contact-interaction divergences that can be promoted into the RG follow-up draft to contextualize why the 2D delta is the cleanest log-RG witness.
