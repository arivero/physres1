# Q21 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5g

## Goal
Review the extended D1.5 sequence after adding non-circular extension D1.5g.

## Checks
1. Read D1.5b-g for consistency and assumption discipline.
2. Verify D1.5g is explicitly planar and kinematic.
3. Guardrail scan in `paper/main.md` for cycle-label leakage.

## Acceptance Tests
- No contradiction among branch statements.
- No universality drift beyond branch scope.
