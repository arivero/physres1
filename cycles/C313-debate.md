# C313 Debate

## Hard Question
Is Remark P5.2a (deformation equivalence is physical) placing too much weight on a single example (PDM harmonic oscillator)? Could a skeptic argue that the energy-shift estimate is model-dependent and doesn't establish general physical equivalence?

## Resolution
The remark is correctly scoped:
1. It says "explicit calculations for a position-dependent mass" — it doesn't claim universality from one example.
2. The four-layer stratification IS general (it applies to any quadratic symbol f(q)p^2).
3. The key structural point — that Layer 2 agreement is forced by self-adjointness, not model-specific — is model-independent.
4. The energy estimate provides a concrete quantitative anchor, which is more useful than a pure formal statement.
5. The "Lorenz gauge" analogy correctly conveys: canonical choice within equivalence class, not unique physics.

The remark strengthens the paper by making a formal claim (P5.2) operationally verifiable. A skeptic wanting different physics from different orderings must find a system where Layer 3 differences are measurably large — which our estimate shows requires non-perturbative mass variation (α₀ > 0.5), where the perturbative framework itself breaks down.
