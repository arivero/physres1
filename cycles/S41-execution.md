# S41 Execution: Unresolved `conv_patched.md` Theme Mapping

## Work Completed
- Scanned `conv_patched.md` for high-signal themes and compared against current draft coverage.
- Built a coverage matrix with covered/partial/missing classification and concrete next actions in:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-unresolved-conv-themes-coverage-map.md`.

## Key Outcome
Two high-value “gap” candidates were identified:
1. make explicit the **Zeno-style refinement paradox** lens (why limit control is nontrivial, motivating finite deformation scales),
2. make explicit the **QFT doubling** (\(|\mathcal A|^2\) / closed-time-path) continuation of the half-density amplitude-density separation.

## Next Spawn
- `C68`: promote one concise gap item into manuscript prose (choose one, keep it tight).
