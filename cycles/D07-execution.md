# D07 Execution: Log publication-safety wave + refresh cycle board

Date: 2026-02-11

## Decision
- Chosen target: refresh durable logs/board after the C95/C96 hygiene waves and queue the next optional follow-ups.
- Why now: stale status boards and missing log entries create coordination friction across assistants.

## One-sentence novelty claim (non-manuscript)
Small publication-safety edits (navigation cues; removal of repo-internal pointers) can reduce referee friction without adding technical scope or bibliography debt.

## Scope disclaimer (non-manuscript)
This is not a claim of new physics or new mathematical results; it is project hygiene and reader-experience hardening.

## Updates made
- `docs/research-state.md`: marked the reader-map target as completed and listed current optional follow-ups.
- `docs/research-log.md`: added entries for the completed `C94/Q51` and the new `C95/Q52`, `C96/Q53` waves.
- `cycles/index.md`: refreshed statuses (including `D` track) and updated Next Action.

## Spawned cycles
- None required.
- Optional queue:
  - `C97`: make `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` fully standalone (inline minimal support or add standard citations).
  - `B12`: time-capped OA attempt for `[Dirac1933]`.
  - `D08`: pick next novelty thread + spawn bounded `S` deliverable.
