# S146 Debate: Mandelstam-Tamm

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- The M-T relation is the referee-safe version of "energy-time uncertainty" — avoids time operator issues completely.
- Energy eigenstates being static (d⟨A⟩/dt = 0 for all A) is the temporal analog of Lz eigenstates having uniform φ.
- Coherent states saturate the bound — this is actually stronger than the blackboard's (incorrect) claim, because saturation confirms the coherent state as minimum-uncertainty for BOTH spatial and temporal tradeoffs.
- Reviewer caught harmonic oscillator error; corrected version strengthens the narrative.
