## Subagent Review (rigorous mathematical physicist)
Both additions reviewed in full:

1. **Example 5.2 (fermionic mediators)**: CLEAN
   - f₀(k) = -a/(1+ika) correct (effective-range with r₀=0)
   - Bound state E = -ℏ²/(2ma²) verified from pole at k=i/a
   - d=2 vs d=3 comparison accurate
   - Renormalization statement correct

2. **Remark 6.3 (action-angle)**: CLEAN
   - EBK formula I_k = (n_k + α_k/4)ℏ correct
   - Maslov index interpretation accurate
   - Angle delocalization claim valid in semiclassical context
   - Connection to Examples 6.1/6.2 sound
   - Pedagogical note: "uniform on torus" is leading-order semiclassical — implicit from the "EBK quantization" framing. No correction needed.

## Result
No changes needed. Both additions verified correct.
