# S188 Debate: Crossing Symmetry

## Key Issue: Mandelstam Analyticity
**Claim**: Mandelstam analyticity is an assumption in fermionic theories, not a derived theorem.
**Resolution**: Stated explicitly in blackboard. Avoids false causality claims.

## Key Issue: Grassmann Obstruction vs Channel Kinematics
**Claim**: Grassmann obstruction (source nature) is orthogonal to Mandelstam channel decomposition.
**Resolution**: Separated clearly. Each is independent physical content.

## Key Issue: Froissart-Martin Bound
**Proposal**: Include Froissart-Martin soft-limit bound for fermions.
**Decision**: Dropped. Out of scope for crossing symmetry remark. Mentioning soft limits would open new threads.

## Outcome
All HIGH/MEDIUM issues resolved. Blackboard reflects consensus physics.
