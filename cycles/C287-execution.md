# C287 Execution: Promote threshold-unification clarification in relativistic satellite

Date: 2026-02-14
Status: Completed

## Changes
1. Added `Remark 3.1c (Unified threshold rule via kinetic asymptotics)` to `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`.
2. New text states \(q_\mathrm{crit}=\nu+1\) with Newton (\(\nu=2\to3\)) and SR (\(\nu=1\to2\)) instances.
3. Added explicit caveat: this asymptotic rule is independent of the algebraic dimensional identity specific to \(q=2\).
