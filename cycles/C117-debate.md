# C117 Debate: Should the fermionic escape route be mentioned in PA-D1.3a?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
S79 noted that Yukawa couplings have half-integer length dimensions for odd d, potentially lifting the parity obstruction. Should PA-D1.3a mention this?

## Recommendation
No. PA-D1.3a follows PA-D1.3, which is explicitly "gravity-only." The fermionic escape route changes the coupling set and is a different sieve (not gravity-only). Mentioning it here would break the scope of the derivation. If desired, it could be added as a separate remark in §3.2 (branch 4: "Change which coupling supplies the scale") or in a future S cycle exploring the multi-coupling landscape. Keep PA-D1.3a focused on the gravity-only case.
