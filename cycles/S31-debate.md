# S31 Debate: Source Worldline vs Observer Congruence

## Question
Is choosing source 4-velocity \(U^\mu\) genuinely “minimal,” or just another arbitrary observer choice?

## Current Resolution
For the current central-source model it is minimal:
- the source worldline is already part of the dynamics,
- using \(U^\mu\) adds no new independent field,
- a generic \(u^\mu(x)\) would add extra structure and enlarge convention freedom.
