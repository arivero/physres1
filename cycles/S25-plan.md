# S25 Plan: Schwarzschild Geodesics as a Clean GR Baseline (Effective Potential + Photon Sphere)

## Goal
Produce a derivation-first GR baseline for the relativistic-orbit branch:
- conserved energy/angular momentum from Killing fields,
- effective potential form for timelike and null geodesics,
- circular-orbit conditions,
- photon sphere at \(r=3M\) (in \(G=c=1\) units) and the ISCO fact \(r=6M\) (optional).

## Scope
- One blackboard note with:
  - metric + equatorial reduction,
  - constants of motion \(E,L\),
  - radial equation cast as \(\dot r^2 + V_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)=E^2\) (or equivalent),
  - derivation of photon-sphere radius and impact parameter \(b=L/E\).
- No manuscript edits in this cycle.

## Acceptance Tests
1. The note derives \(r_{\text{ph}}=3M\) for null circular geodesics (not just states it).
2. The note clearly distinguishes timelike vs null effective potentials and parameters (proper time vs affine parameter).
3. Units/conventions are explicit (set \(G=c=1\), then note how to restore).
