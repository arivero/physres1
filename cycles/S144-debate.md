# S144 Debate: Dimensional regularization

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Dim reg is structurally different from cutoff (no lattice, no partition) but produces same physics — refinement-scheme independence.
- MS-bar is the QFT analog of the α-ordering convention in Example 3.1.
- Gauge+Lorentz preservation parallels symplectic integrators preserving Hamiltonian structure (Remark 3.4).
- Reviewer confused uncuttable satellite with main paper for placement — target is correctly uncuttable Section 4.
