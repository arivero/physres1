# S187 Plan: QND Measurement Blackboard (Action-Angle Paper §5)

## Objective
Write blackboard note on quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of action variables for Section 5 of action-angle paper.

## Scope
- QND condition: [A, H_sys] = 0 AND [A, H_int] = 0
- Distinction: back-action redirected to conjugate, not absent
- Dispersive cavity-QED: Rydberg atoms + Ramsey interferometry
- Zeno effect conceptually distinct from QND
- Connection to Section 5 measurement trilogy (decoherence, Zeno, QND)

## Methods
1. Develop QND theory (dual commutator conditions)
2. Clarify back-action vs. conjugate redistribution
3. Describe experimental cavity-QED realization
4. Distinguish Zeno (frequent measurement) from QND (non-invasive coupling)
5. Launch quantum optics experimentalist reviewer for subagent QA pass

## Expected Output
Blackboard 1 ready for promotion to Remark 5.7.
