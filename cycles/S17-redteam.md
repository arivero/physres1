# S17 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim:** “D=4 is derived” from an ansatz-specific simplification.
2. **Hidden assumptions:** readers may not notice we are restricting to conformal backgrounds and scalar Laplacians.
3. **Parameter confusion:** introducing a family \(O_a\) obscures the half-density motivation.

## Mitigations
1. Keep language: “within the conformal ansatz”, “heuristic filter candidate”.
2. Make the specialization \(a=D/2\) explicit and explain it corresponds to half-density scalarization.
3. Present \(O_a\) only as a short auxiliary tool; keep the main line in terms of the half-density operator.
