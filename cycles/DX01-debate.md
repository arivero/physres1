# DX01 Debate: Is RCP tautological?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
If every discrepancy revealed by refinement is absorbed as "the obstruction refinement reveals" (anomalies, counterterms, ordering corrections), can RCP ever be falsified?

## Current position
RCP is better understood as a meta-principle (like the principle of relativity) than as a falsifiable claim. Its value is organizational: it identifies which structures are *forced* by refinement compatibility and which are *choices*. A concrete "falsification" would require finding a physically meaningful law that provably cannot be formulated as a refinement-compatible composition — and the candidate would then likely be declared "not physically meaningful" by the principle itself.

The risk is circularity: RCP defines "physical" as "refinement-compatible" and then claims all physical laws are refinement-compatible. The escape from circularity is that RCP makes concrete *structural predictions* (e.g., the t^{-d/2} normalization, the existence of counterterms with specific algebraic structure, the Poisson-bracket recovery condition). These predictions can fail for specific proposed theories.

## What would change my mind?
- A concrete, physically realized system where composition is well-defined but RCP-type compatibility provably fails — and the system is nonetheless empirically successful.
- Alternatively: a demonstration that RCP's structural predictions are vacuous (any algebra satisfies them under suitable reinterpretation).
