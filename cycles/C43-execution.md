# C43 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Changes
1. `docs/research-state.md`
   - Recorded the steering preference: avoid BV/BRST beyond outlook; prioritize quantization via stationary extremes + refinement-compatible composition and the structural emergence of an action-scale regulator (\(\hbar\)).
2. `cycles/index.md`
   - Deprioritized BV bibliography as “only if explicitly requested later”.
