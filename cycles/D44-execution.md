# D44 Execution: RCP Foundations Paper Scoping

Date: 2026-02-14

## Decision
Start new satellite paper: "Refinement Compatibility Principle (RCP) as Foundations"

## One-sentence novelty claim
Formalize RCP as falsifiable axioms with three compatibility channels (partition, representation, scale), each with worked examples showing how closure forces structural constants.

## Scope verdict
**Target (6-9pp):**
- Axioms A1-A5 + commuting diagrams
- Three worked examples (Noether, ordering, RG)
- P4.2 as crown witness (partition closure → ℏ-necessity)

## Mathematics delivered
Blackboard slot 2 (S299, 143 lines):
- Core RCP slogan + operational form
- Three channels (partition/representation/scale) with witnesses
- 5 axioms (composition, identity, representation equivalence, scale invariance, dimensional homogeneity)
- Noether's theorem worked out + RCP interpretation
- Scope map for 7-section paper

## Spawned cycles
- S299 (completed): scope map + Noether example
- C319 (next): draft initial RCP paper structure

## Updates made
- None needed in research-state.md yet (new satellite, TBD after C319)
- Will update cycles/index.md after C319
