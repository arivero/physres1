# B10 Red Team: Bibliography Risks (Theme K)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Failure modes
- OA fetch blocked:
  - Mitigation: create `sources/pending-tongqmlectures.md` with attempted URLs; keep the dependent note derivation-first and citation-light.
- Anchor does not explicitly show \(e^{im\phi}\):
  - Mitigation: pick another OA note focused on angular momentum / spherical harmonics.
