# Q07 Debate

## Question
Does mentioning string tension/\(\alpha'\) in the scale-sieve examples risk turning the half-density argument into “string theory says so”, or is it best framed as an admissibility knob (“if a universal area scale is admitted”)?

## Working Resolution
Keep the \(\alpha'\) example strictly as a *dimension-sieve variant* under H2.5/H2.7 admissibility rules:
it demonstrates that once an area scale is admitted as a universal coupling, \(d=4\) is no longer uniquely selected by the monomial sieve (instead \(d\equiv0\pmod4\) appears for \(\alpha'\)-only).
Any “string UV completion” interpretation should remain heuristic/outlook unless anchored and made essential.
