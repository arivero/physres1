# C20 Execution

## Draft Deltas
1. Added `Derivation D1.6b` to `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` making the scaling/RG action on the Dirichlet/Neumann mixing parameter explicit (engineering beta function + fixed points).
2. Added `Example E1.1` to `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` computing 1D \(\delta\)-potential scattering amplitudes and identifying transparent/reflective endpoint behaviors as scale limits.
3. Cleaned the displayed \(3\)D cutoff integral expression in Section 5.8.1 (made the real linear divergence + imaginary part explicit).
4. Renamed the Gaussian coarse-graining derivation label to `Derivation D1.7` to avoid numbering collisions.
5. Rebuilt `papers/rg-fundamental/main.pdf` and removed `.aux`/`.log` artifacts after successful generation.
