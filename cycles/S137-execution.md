# S137 Execution: Berry-Tabor and spectral statistics

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work Done
- Wrote blackboard slot 0: Berry-Tabor conjecture (Poisson statistics for integrable systems), BGS conjecture (GOE/GUE for chaotic systems), Brody interpolation.
- Quantum chaos specialist reviewed: all CORRECT. GOE Wigner surmise verified. GUE proportionality form acceptable. All reference details confirmed (Berry-Tabor 1977 Proc. R. Soc. A 356, BGS 1984 PRL 52).
