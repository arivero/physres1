# B06 Execution: Reference for "No Lebesgue Measure" Obstruction

## Work
- Identified an OA-accessible reference explicitly discussing translation-invariant measures in infinite dimensions.
- Added bibliography key:
  - `[Velhinho2017InfDimMeasure]` (MDPI *Mathematics*, OA) to `paper/bibliography.md`.

## Result
The repo now has at least one external anchor supporting the measure-theory obstruction used heuristically in the Introduction.

## Next
- Optional `C` cycle: add an inline citation to `paper/main.md` at `Heuristic H0.2a`.
- `S48`: proceed with distributional Euler-Lagrange / delta-derivative probes if still needed.
