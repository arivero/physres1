## Hard question
Is the Van Vleck determinant just a textbook result restated?
## Resolution
Yes — but the *connection* to the paper's half-density framework is the point. Section 3.3 establishes that amplitudes carry square-root Hessian weights generically; Section 3.5 shows that this abstract pattern *is* the Van Vleck determinant in the physical context. The free-particle check (recovering t^{-d/2} from Section 2) closes the loop.
