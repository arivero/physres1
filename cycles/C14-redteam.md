## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. The 2D delta derivation is self-contained but still lacks a non-preprint “standard reference” citation in the bibliography for external validation/positioning.
2. The semigroup-vs-group discussion is structural; adding one explicit coarse-graining example (beyond parameter running) would sharpen the non-invertibility point.
3. “Cristina’s 2D delta findings” are not yet identified/ingested, so the draft can’t align notation or claims to that reference yet.

## Evidence Needed
1. Identify/ingest the intended 2D delta reference and cross-check constants/conventions.
2. Add one non-preprint standard reference for 2D delta renormalization (OA if possible).
3. Add one explicit coarse-graining map example (even toy) where information loss is manifest.
