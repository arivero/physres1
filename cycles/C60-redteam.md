# C60 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Scope inflation:** readers think non-planar dynamics are now fully treated.
2. **Notation jump:** abrupt switch from scalar to vector symbols causes confusion.
3. **Over-caveating:** too many guardrails obscure the core witness.

## Mitigations
1. Keep D1.5h explicitly cautionary and short.
2. Present vector identities in one compact block.
3. Preserve prior scalar thread unchanged and mark projection as optional model choice.
