## Failure modes

### 1. Vague program reference
- Risk: "the broader refinement-compatibility program" is meaningless to an outside reader.
- Mitigation: the paper is self-contained — the program reference is context, not content. The key claims (obstruction statement, contact expansion derivation) stand on their own.
