# S147 Debate: Lattice gauge theory blackboard

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Wilson's plaquette action, β = 2N/g², and beta function coefficient all verified correct.
- Exact gauge invariance at every lattice spacing: correct and key structural feature.
- Asymptotic freedom driving continuum limit: correct.
- One error found: compact U(1) phase transition is second-order, not first-order. Omitted from promoted remark.
- Clay Prize clarification: about mass gap specifically. Incorporated.
