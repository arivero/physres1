# S40 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overcompression:** subtle dimensional differences get flattened into one slogan.
2. **Scope drift:** introducing a new taxonomy not supported in the manuscript.
3. **Priority drift:** prolonged contact-potential discussion overpowers broader RG thesis.

## Mitigations
1. Keep statement explicitly heuristic and anchored to existing section content.
2. Avoid adding new formal claims; summarize only.
3. Limit promotion to one short remark in Section 5.8.
