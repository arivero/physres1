# Q61 Debate: Should H1.2 cite Nauenberg (1994) now or wait?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
H1.2 makes the symplectic-Euler identification without attribution. Nauenberg (1994) is the standard reference. Should we add the citation now (requiring B16 first) or is the identification sufficiently "common knowledge"?

## Current position
The identification is well-known in the numerical-methods community but not in the general physics readership. Attribution to Nauenberg strengthens scholarly credibility. Recommend B16 → micro-C.

## What would change my mind?
If adding Nauenberg (1994) to the bibliography adds scope creep to the bibliography (yet another Springer paywalled reference). But the citation is a one-time effort and the reference is directly relevant.
