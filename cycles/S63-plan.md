# S63 Plan: RCP as an Explicit Compatibility Diagram (Toy Family Witness)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Produce a compact blackboard note that makes the Refinement Compatibility Principle (RCP) operational:
write it as a closure/commutation requirement on a family of prediction maps under three operations (partition composition, representation change, scale comparison), and include one toy-family witness where the closure fails if conventions are inconsistent.

## Deliverable
- `blackboards/2026-02-11-rcp-compatibility-diagram-toy-family.md`
  - includes a copyable “promotion candidate” block for a future `C90` insertion into `paper/main.md` (RCP appendix).

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S63-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- One explicit diagram/closure equation (not just words).
- One concrete toy example demonstrating a constraint (a closure can fail).
- A promotion candidate block ready to paste into `paper/main.md`.
