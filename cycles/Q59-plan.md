# Q59 Plan: Referee pass on C102 (rooted-tree notation consistency)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C102`: defined F([•]) and F([•,•]) inline in Remark D6.2a1; added f ∈ C² scope.

## Goal
Referee-pass the C102 changes for correctness, notation consistency across main + rg-fundamental companion, claim hygiene, and reader experience.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q59-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Notation: F([•]) and F([•,•]) consistent between both papers.
- Regularity: C² (main) vs "smooth" (companion) — compatible?
- Jacobian notation: f'(y)[v] uniform across both.
- Euler map definition: E_h(y) consistent.
- Claim labels: any collision risk between papers.
- Typography: Runge-Kutta hyphen/en-dash.
- Citations: rooted-tree references consistent.

## Acceptance criteria
- A concrete list of edits to do next, expressed as spawned cycles.
