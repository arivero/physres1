# C296 Debate: Is domain-parameter data too far from ordering data?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does adding self-adjoint extension data drift away from the ordering/discretization theme of Package B?

## Options
1. Keep only ordering formulas and avoid extension theory.
2. Include one extension witness showing that operator/domain data is part of representation compatibility.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
Package B is about representation compatibility, not only symbol ordering. A compact extension witness clarifies that domain choices can encode inequivalent quantum content even with the same classical symbol.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Full extension classification remains optional follow-up work.
