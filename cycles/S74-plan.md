# S74 Plan: Ordering ambiguity for quadratic symbols

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Extend Section 10.2's ordering computation from the linear symbol A = f(q)p to the quadratic symbol A = f(q)p². Verify the correction structure, apply to position-dependent mass, and connect back to the half-density resolution of ordering ambiguity.

## Thread
Thread 6 (ordering/discretization as equivalence class), with cross-connection to thread 2b (half-densities in QFT).

## Method
1. Compute Q_W(fp²) - Q_L(fp²) using commutator algebra.
2. Cross-check via the Weyl kernel representation.
3. Apply to f = 1/m(q) and compare with Laplace-Beltrami ordering.
4. Connect to half-density conjugated Laplacian (HD-D1.3).
