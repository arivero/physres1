# Q02 Plan

## Goal
Run a referee-style quality pass after the recent delta/half-density promotions (`C26–C28`) to ensure:
1. the Planck-area draft remains hypothesis-clean (no hidden coupling assumptions),
2. the RG note’s delta conventions are consistent and not overclaimed,
3. the “half-density prioritary” thread is coherent across drafts without bloating the cornerstone paper.

## Scope
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md`
2. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`
3. `cycles/index.md` / `docs/research-log.md` (only if needed for action items)

## Acceptance Tests
1. `cycles/Q02-execution.md` contains a concise list of actionable next steps, tagged by cycle type (`C`/`S`/`B`).
2. No manuscript edits required by this cycle (quality-only).
