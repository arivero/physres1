## Failure Modes to Watch
1. Mixing up configuration dimension (half-density weight) with spacetime dimension without saying so.
2. Smuggling in a preferred measure/reference half-density while claiming “background-free”.
3. Overstating: “area scale exists” \(\neq\) “it equals Planck area” unless gravity-only assumptions are imposed.

## Mitigations
- Add an explicit “what is \(d\)?” bookkeeping paragraph in the draft.
- Keep a sharp hypothesis ladder (H2.3–H2.5) and mark which steps are optional.
- Use RG-invariant scale arguments as one branch, gravity-only sieve as another branch; compare rather than conflate.
