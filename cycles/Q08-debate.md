# Q08 Debate: How Much “Toy Renormalization” Is Too Much?

## Hard Question
Does the derivative/counterterm micro-model risk making the RG story sound trivial (“renormalization is just calculus”), undermining the paper’s credibility?

## Current Resolution
The micro-model is valuable only if it is framed correctly:
- as an **analogy of limit-definition structure** (regulated object, divergence, subtraction, scheme fixing),
- not as an explanatory reduction of perturbative QFT renormalization to calculus,
- and with explicit off-ramps: the detailed distributional/sign work is kept in `blackboards/` and the delta-objects note, not in the RG draft’s main line.
