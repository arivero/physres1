## Hard question
Is a purely numerical witness (D1.2a) appropriate for a paper that aims to be structural?

**Decision**: Yes. The numerical example does not replace the algebraic proof (D1.1 + D1.2), but makes it concrete and falsifiable. The subagent reviewer specifically noted this as a strength. The example also clarifies which quantities are exact (L, area) vs approximate (trajectory shape, energy) under the polygonal scheme.
