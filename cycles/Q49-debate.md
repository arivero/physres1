# Q49 Debate: Should we keep “continuation” language in Appendix 10?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Appendix 10 uses phrasing like “replaces the earlier continuation version” and “continuation outcome.” In a standalone journal submission, should this be rewritten as neutral “appendix summary” language?

## Recommendation
Yes. Replace editorial/versioning language with standalone prose. Keep the technical content unchanged.
