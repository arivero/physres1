# S18 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. **Ambiguity:** readers confuse Lie derivatives with covariant derivatives and think we are hiding a metric.
2. **Overformalization:** the note turns into a differential-geometry treatise rather than a usable dictionary.
3. **Disconnected to physics:** it doesn’t clearly connect to counterterms/contact terms.

## Mitigations
1. State explicitly that Lie derivative is the minimal, connection-free derivative notion for densities/half-densities.
2. Keep it to one page of identities with a short “why it matters” section.
3. Include the explicit point-splitting \(\to \delta'\) limit and link to S15 for the subtraction toy model.
