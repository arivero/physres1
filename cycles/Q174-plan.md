# Q174 Plan: Referee pass on C291 curved-manifold Package B extension

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C291`: curved-manifold Package B extension in Appendix 10.2

## Goal
Referee-pass C291 additions for mathematical correctness, scope discipline, and notation coherence.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q174-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `notebooks/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Unitary-conjugation argument is structurally correct.
- Left-order non-symmetry identity is plausible and scoped.
- No overclaim of self-adjointness beyond stated boundary.
- Package B status statement remains accurate.

## Acceptance criteria
- PASS/FAIL with concrete follow-up cycle if needed.
