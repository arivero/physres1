# Q31 Debate: Is One Remark Enough for Doubling?

## Question
Should `half-density-qft` include a longer section on density matrices/real-time contours, or keep it as one remark?

## Current Resolution
Keep it as one remark. This repo prioritizes derivation-first kernel semantics; a full nonequilibrium-QFT section would require a dedicated bibliography cycle and likely a separate draft.
