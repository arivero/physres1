# C84 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Standard narrative drift**: reads like the usual "Wick rotate and do stat mech" story.
2. **Overclaiming rigor**: implying we built a full path-space measure.
3. **Parameter confusion**: readers think \(\hbar\) is introduced by hand rather than forced by composition + dimensions.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the witness explicitly finite-dimensional and tied to refinement-composition, not thermodynamic analogy.
2. Add one sentence disclaiming infinite-dimensional measure claims (already in Section 6.4).
3. Emphasize: exponential weighting is forced by additivity + composition; \(\hbar\) is the universal sharpening scale.
