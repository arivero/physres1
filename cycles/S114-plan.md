## Goal
Study the 3D delta-potential contact interaction to write Example 5.2 in the fermionic mediators satellite. The 3D case contrasts with Example 5.1 (2D): linear rather than logarithmic divergence, scattering length as the RG-invariant scale, bound state E = -ℏ²/(2ma²). This completes the dimensional comparison d=1 (well-defined), d=2 (log), d=3 (linear).
