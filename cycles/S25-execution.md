# S25 Execution: Schwarzschild Effective Potential + Photon Sphere

## Work Completed
- Derived the equatorial Schwarzschild geodesic equations using conserved \(E,L\).
- Wrote the radial motion as a 1D effective-potential problem for both timelike and null geodesics.
- Derived the null circular orbit (photon sphere) radius \(r=3M\) and recorded the impact parameter \(b=L/E\) interpretation.
