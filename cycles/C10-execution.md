# C10 Execution

## Manuscript Deltas
1. Replaced strict-deformation continuation draft with foundational `RCP` appendix (`10.3`) in `paper/main.md`.
2. Added `Proposition P10.1` defining partition/representation/scale compatibility.
3. Added `Derivation D10.1` mapping the principle to cycle outputs (`C01`--`C06`).
4. Added interpretive boundary via `Heuristic H10.1`.

## Equations Added
1. Compact compatibility expression for prediction invariance under \(\mathcal C_t\), \(\mathcal Q_\hbar\), and \(\mathcal R_\Lambda\).

## Sections Touched
1. `paper/main.md`.
2. `cycles/index.md`.
3. `paper/bibliography.md` (continuation framing alignment).

## Rationale
`C10` aligns the continuation with your stated objective: a new foundational concept rather than a strict-deformation technical branch.

## Acceptance Test Results
1. Labeled proposition and derivation in `10.3`: passed.
2. Explicit mapping to prior cycles: passed.
3. Continuation framing updated away from strict-deformation objective: passed.
