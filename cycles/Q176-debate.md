# Q176 Debate: Are the P12.2 constants too loose to be useful?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Do conservative constants in P12.2 undermine its value?

## Recommendation
No. At this stage, explicit conservative control is preferable to unverified sharp constants; sharper estimates can be an optional follow-up.
