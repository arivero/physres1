# S41 Plan: Unresolved `conv_patched.md` Theme Mapping

## Goal
Map major conversation themes against current manuscript coverage and extract one high-value promotion target.

## Scope
1. List principal themes from `conv_patched.md`.
2. Classify each as covered / partial / missing in current drafts.
3. Select one immediate `C`-cycle promotion item.

## Acceptance Tests
- Mapping is concrete and file-anchored.
- At least one missing theme is translated into a clear `C68` target.
- No bibliography claims are added from transcript content.
