## Failure modes
1. Curved-manifold benchmark could be too formal and not visibly connected to ordering ambiguity.
2. Integration-by-parts identity for left ordering could be sign-incorrect.
3. Claims might overreach to essential self-adjointness.

## Mitigations
1. Tie each statement explicitly to `Q_L` vs `Q_W`/half-density narrative in Appendix 10.2.
2. Keep the identity in a compact, testable form and verify consistency with 1D reduction.
3. Keep explicit scope boundary statement (symmetry benchmark only).
