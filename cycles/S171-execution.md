# S171 — Execution

## What was done
Wrote blackboard on dualities as refinement equivalences, covering:
- Kramers–Wannier self-duality of the 2D Ising model at criticality.
- T-duality as an exact equivalence of string compactifications.
- Montonen–Olive electric–magnetic duality and its generalisation.
- Attempted framing of all three as instances of "refinement equivalence."

## Reviewer feedback
Blackboard reviewed by subagent with **string theorist** persona.
Corrections caught:

1. **$g \leftrightarrow 1/g$ oversimplified.** The full Montonen–Olive
   duality group is $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, not just strong/weak
   inversion. The $\tau \mapsto -1/\tau$ generator is only one element.
2. **$\mathcal{N}=4$ exactness overstated.** The blackboard said S-duality
   "is exact in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM." Corrected: it is *conjectured* to
   be exact (strongly supported by BPS spectrum matching, but unproven).
3. **Refinement framing too vague.** The original text tried to define
   "refinement equivalence" as a general principle but gave no precise
   criterion. Reframed as: dualities provide "multiple descriptions of
   the same limit object" — a more honest and defensible statement.
4. **UV/IR mixing + asymptotic safety claim too loose.** A paragraph
   linking dualities to UV/IR mixing and asymptotic safety had no
   supporting argument. Dropped entirely.

All four corrections incorporated into the blackboard before promotion.
