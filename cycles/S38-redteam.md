# S38 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Toy overreach:** treating one covariance family as a general law.
2. **Numerical fragility:** MC mismatch depends on sample size and RNG seed.
3. **Policy hardening:** readers interpret trigger as strict cutoff.

## Mitigations
1. Label result as regime illustration, not theorem.
2. Keep sample size explicit and reproducible.
3. Preserve qualitative wording ("few-percent scale") in manuscript.
