# S52 Execution: Re-scan `conv_patched.md` and Update Coverage Map

## Work
- Updated the durable coverage map to reflect the current repo state:
  - `docs/conv-coverage-map.md` (moved several items from "missing" to "covered by dependent drafts" and added the new Introduction obstruction witnesses).
- Updated the quick blackboard coverage matrix accordingly:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-unresolved-conv-themes-coverage-map.md`.

## Result
The remaining high-ROI conversation themes that still warrant new work are now clearer and mostly fall into:
1. **Control-map \(\tau\) formalization** (write our own derivation-first note; reduce preprint dependence).
2. **Generic-\(q\) Planck areal-speed derivation** (self-contained; promote into `papers/planck-area/main.md`).
3. **Gauge/string-tension scale supplier** (needs `B` anchors before any manuscript promotion).

## Next
- Spawn `S53`: generic-\(q\) areal-speed derivation (then `C` to promote into `papers/planck-area/main.md`).
- Spawn `S54`: control-map \(\tau\) formalization note in `paper/notes/` (then a small `C` promotion into `paper/main.md` if it becomes independent of preprint wording).
- Spawn `B07`: Wilson loop / confinement anchors if we open the gauge-string-tension branch.
