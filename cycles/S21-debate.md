# S21 Debate: What Does “Special” Mean Here?

## Question
When we say “\(q=2\) is special”, do we mean:
1) the force law is singled out by dimensionality/Green functions (physics of long-range fields), or
2) the Planck-areal-speed story gives a *low-energy witness* of a universal area scale, or
3) a deeper half-density/normalization principle forces it?

## Current Resolution
- In this cycle we only establish (1) + (2) as a clean derivation:
  - given a power-law force \(F=K/r^q\), the Planck-areal-speed substitution yields \(r\) proportional to a power of the reduced Compton length, and the power is \(1\) only at \(q=2\).
  - in Newtonian gravity, \(q=2\) corresponds to \(n=3\) spatial dimensions (hence spacetime \(D=4\)).
- We do **not** claim this proves the half-density scale ladder, only that it supplies a sharp “\(D=4\)” witness that can be compared against other \(D=4\) filters (H2.5, operator simplicity).
