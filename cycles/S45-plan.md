# S45 Plan: String-Tension Scale Supplier Branch

## Goal
Clarify the logical role of string tension as an area-scale supplier and separate:
1) fundamental UV area parameters, and
2) emergent IR string tensions generated by RG invariants.

## Scope
1. Write the two meanings and where each sits in the hypothesis ladder (E4 vs H2.13).
2. Extract one concise manuscript clarification for `papers/planck-area/main.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- No conflation between analytic monomial sieve (H2.5) and transmutation branch (H2.13).
- Promotion target is short and does not require new bibliography claims.
