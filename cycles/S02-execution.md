# S02 Execution

## Work
- Wrote a blackboard note exploring a precise bookkeeping identification:
  scale-dependent scalarization \(\sigma_\ast(\mu)\) of half-densities is formally equivalent to a wavefunction renormalization factor \(Z(\mu)\) acting on scalar representatives.
- Included a caution separating geometric density weights (square-root Jacobians) from anomalous RG scaling.
- Extracted two explicit promotion candidates (kept as candidates, not promoted).

## Result
- New note: `blackboards/2026-02-10-scalarization-gauge-running.md`.

## Status
Completed.
