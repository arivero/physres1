# Q171 Debate: Should Q demand a longer derivation inline?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Must Section 3 include full asymptotic derivation details, or is note-backed remark sufficient?

## Resolution
Remark-level text is sufficient in satellite scope; detailed derivation remains in `paper/notes/` for traceability and possible later expansion.
