# Q27 Debate: Is D1.5 Getting Overcrowded?

## Question
Does adding D1.5m improve operational clarity or create excessive local complexity?

## Current Resolution
Keep D1.5m because it:
- resolves ambiguity in D1.5l trigger interpretation,
- stays compact,
- prevents stronger overclaims about universal thresholds.
