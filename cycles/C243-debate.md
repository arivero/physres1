# C243 — Debate

## Key decisions
1. Used H^2 (not H^1) per reviewer correction. The operator domain of the
   Laplacian is H^2, and Morrey embedding gives H^2 ⊂ C^0 iff 2·2 > d,
   i.e., d ≤ 3. This correctly matches the classification.
2. Stated the resolvent exponent d-2 explicitly rather than using the
   heat kernel exponent d/2 alone. Added the Laplace transform connection
   sentence to bridge the two exponents.
3. Mentioned the delta subfamily restriction for d=1 (psi continuous at
   origin) rather than the full U(2) family, since the paper uses V=g|0><0|
   which presupposes well-defined psi(0).
