# B02 Debate

## Question
Should we cite a textbook (often paywalled) or prioritize an OA paper/notes for the Van Vleck prefactor statement?

## Working Resolution
Prefer OA first per repo policy. If an OA paper gives an explicit formula and is stable, use it as the modern anchor; optionally add a textbook as `PENDING` later if desired for canonicality.
