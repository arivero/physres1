# S92 Plan: Assess cornerstone→RG-fundamental cross-references
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
The cornerstone has 1 satellite cross-reference (HD-D1.3 in Section 10.2) but zero references to the RG-fundamental companion. Sections 8 and 10.5 overlap substantially with RG-fundamental. Identify the 1–2 most valuable cross-reference points.

## Method
1. Compare cornerstone Section 8 + Section 10.5 against RG-fundamental Sections 2–6.
2. Identify material in the satellite that is NOT in the cornerstone and that would genuinely help a reader.
3. Recommend ≤2 cross-reference insertions, following the HD-D1.3 pattern (minimal, specific label).
