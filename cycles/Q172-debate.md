# Q172 Debate: Is C289 too broad for one cycle?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does covering Packages A/C/D/E in one promotion wave compromise rigor compared with one-package-per-cycle execution?

## Recommendation
No. The additions remain scoped and internally coherent; breadth is acceptable because each block is a compact witness-level derivation. The key is to close Package B next to avoid asymmetry.
