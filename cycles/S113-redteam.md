## Failure modes
1. **Classical action formula**: The formula S_cl = mω/(2 sin ωΔt)[(q_f²+q_i²)cos ωΔt - 2q_f q_i] is standard (Feynman-Hibbs, Schulman, etc.) but could have sign or factor errors. Verified against Feynman-Hibbs standard result.
2. **Caustic interpretation**: Stating that √D → ∞ at ωΔt = π means the semiclassical approximation "breaks down" is slightly informal — more precisely, the saddle-point method becomes non-uniform because multiple classical paths contribute (the two paths from q_i to -q_i merge). The text says "breaks down" which is acceptable for a brief example.
