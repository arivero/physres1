**For:** Monodromy is the central obstruction in the paper's §6; Remark 6.10 makes
the GL(d,Z) and quantum-lattice-defect consequences explicit for the reader.
**Against:** Duistermaat reference error could have propagated — double-check .bib entry.
**Resolution:** Reference corrected (CPAM 33 (1980) 687). Content adds geometric clarity; promote.
