# S149 Red Team: Bargmann representation blackboard

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- α/ᾱ convention: blackboard was inconsistent. Promoted remark uses K_α(z) = e^{ᾱz} consistently.
- Husimi function formula: convention-dependent. Promoted remark states it descriptively ("squared modulus of the Bargmann representative, weighted by the Gaussian measure").
