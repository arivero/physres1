# Q45 Debate: Should we include a “long-range fermion exchange” example?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
Do we add a concrete long-range example (e.g. multi-fermion exchange) to avoid the impression that fermions are always “short range”?

## Decision
No, keep it as outlook only.

## Rationale
Any concrete long-range example is bibliography-heavy and would expand this note beyond its bounded purpose (clarify the source-algebra obstruction and provide the controlled IR contact replacement).
