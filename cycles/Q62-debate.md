# Q62 Debate: Should H4.0c cite a source for YM conformal invariance?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
H4.0c states that the classical YM action is conformally invariant at D=4 without a citation. Should a reference be added?

## Working answer
No citation needed. The conformal weight of the YM action density is elementary dimensional analysis: `sqrt|g| g^{μα} g^{νβ}` picks up `e^{(D-4)σ}` under `g → e^{2σ}g`, which is textbook material (e.g. Wald, Weinberg, or any QFT text discussing dimensional regularization). The claim is at the same level as "the gauge coupling has dimension length^{D-4}" — standard and self-verifiable. Adding a citation would be pedantic for this audience.

## Next check
If a future reviewer requests a citation, any standard QFT or GR textbook discussing conformal transformations of gauge actions would suffice.
