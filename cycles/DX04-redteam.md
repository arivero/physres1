# DX04 Red Team: What could the DX04 sweep have missed?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Likely objections
- **Objection**: "The audit was limited to today's blackboards. Older blackboards may contain unpromoted findings that are now stale or contradicted."
  - Mitigation: The Explore agent audited all named blocks in all four manuscripts and all cross-references. Any older blackboard finding that was promoted would appear as a manuscript block; unpromoted older findings are lower priority since they predate the current structural framework. If a future DX finds a stale contradiction, it can be flagged then.

- **Objection**: "The framing stress-test concluded 'no extension needed' — but the three-level hierarchy could be seen as a refinement of RCP, not just a prediction."
  - Mitigation: The hierarchy (semigroup ⊃ transmutation ⊃ dimension sieve) describes *types of closure* within the scale-compatibility leg of RCP. It does not add a new leg or modify the partition/representation legs. Calling it a "structural prediction of v4" rather than a "v5 extension" is the conservative (and correct) choice. If a future S cycle finds that the hierarchy requires modifying RCP's axioms (e.g., adding a fourth compatibility condition), then v5 would be warranted.

- **Objection**: "DX04 found no new anomalies — is the anomaly register becoming stale?"
  - Mitigation: The register has been actively used (4 entries, all resolved). The absence of new anomalies reflects genuine structural coherence after a sustained campaign (C112–C115, Q67–Q70, S76–S78). New anomalies are more likely to emerge from B or DX cycles that introduce external perspectives.
