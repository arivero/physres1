# Q55 Debate: Is “running with the scale \(h\)” too suggestive?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Does the phrase “effective data runs with the refinement scale \(h\)” in `Remark D1.0a` risk over-associating a numerical-analysis modified-equation construction with physical RG running?

## Recommendation
Keep the remark (it is structurally aligned with the compatibility thesis) but, if revisited in a later `C` wave, add one explicit disclaimer that this “running” is an algorithmic representation of a fixed flow map, not a Wilsonian coarse-graining claim.
