# C83 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Circularity**: readers think \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\) is defined by \(\tau_b\), not the other way around.
2. **Over-generalization**: the lemma feels detached from QFT practice.
3. **Overclaiming**: implying \(\tau_b\) is unique/physical rather than scheme-dependent.

## Mitigations
1. State \(\mathcal C_{b,h}\) as the primary operation ("compare at fixed ruler") and \(\tau_b\) as induced.
2. Keep one explicit witness (step-halving) and one short phrase linking to kernel composition.
3. Explicitly mention scheme dependence; reserve "physical" for invariants (fixed points, exponents).
