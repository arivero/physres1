# B06 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Wrong hypotheses**: reference states a related but not identical theorem (e.g. needs sigma-finiteness / finiteness on an open set).
2. **Weak source**: reference is not widely trusted or is overly informal.
3. **Citation drift**: the manuscript’s heuristic statement slowly changes but the reference no longer matches.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the manuscript statement minimal and match it to the reference’s explicit hypotheses.
2. Prefer peer-reviewed or widely used lecture notes; keep Wikipedia-only anchors out of the bibliography.
3. When editing `Heuristic H0.2a`, re-check the supporting reference and update the ledger entry if needed.
