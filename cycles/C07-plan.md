# C07 Plan

## Goal
Integrate cycles `C01`--`C06` into a single coherent argument, stress-test every transition, and produce an explicit "proven vs heuristic" status map.

## Scope
1. Replace section-9 placeholder with a full consolidation section.
2. Add an end-to-end compatibility statement tying classical extremals, path composition, deformation limit, and RG consistency.
3. Perform transition audit (`C01->C02->C03->C04->C05->C06`) with explicit closure conditions.
4. Add a claim-status table and residual-vulnerability list.
5. Add a forward agenda that is clearly separated from proved content.

## Claims
1. The manuscript's stages are mutually compatible under stated assumptions; no transition requires an unstated replacement postulate.
2. The paper can explicitly separate derivable statements from heuristic bridges without breaking narrative flow.
3. Remaining weaknesses can be labeled as open technical tasks rather than hidden inconsistencies.

## Risks
1. Over-consolidation may blur where rigor ends and heuristic interpretation begins.
2. The status map may become too coarse to be useful if assumptions are not tied to specific segments.
3. Final section may read as summary only unless at least one formal derivation-level closure statement is included.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `paper/main.md` section 9 is fully written and exceeds placeholder scope.
2. Section 9 includes at least one labeled derivation/proposition and explicit transition audit.
3. Section 9 includes a "proven vs heuristic" map with assumptions.
4. `cycles/index.md` marks `C07` complete and the roadmap closed.
