# C172 Plan: Dimensional contact dependence Remark 5.4 in fermionic mediators

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Promote S131 blackboard (dimensional dependence of contact divergences) as Remark 5.4 in fermionic mediators satellite.

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/fermionic-mediators-contact-limits/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Remark 5.4 after Remark 5.3 (unitarity limit), before Section 6 (Outlook)
- ~3 lines comparing d=1 (UV-finite extension datum), d=2 (log divergence, dimensional transmutation), d=3 (linear divergence, scattering length)
- Incorporate reviewer correction: all dimensions need extension theory, distinction is UV-finiteness

Out of scope:
- d=1 scattering formula (too detailed)
- Bibliography additions

## Acceptance criteria
- Fermionic mediators manuscript changed (substantively).
- Diffstat recorded.
- Guard check passes.
