# Q04 Execution

## Review Target
`papers/half-density-qft/main.md` (wave-1 draft).

## Findings
1. **Scope is appropriate:** the draft stays wave-1 sized and does not attempt a full QFT/heat-kernel/BV review.
2. **Canonical vs convention separation is clear:** Sections 2–4 keep the “half-density kernels are canonical; scalarizations (e.g. \(\sqrt{|g|}\)) are choices” message explicit.
3. **Worked computation is present and load-bearing:** Derivation D1.2 is concrete and supports the densitized-field claim.
4. **BV is contained:** BV/field-space content is only an outlook paragraph and is explicitly queued for an anchored bibliography cycle if promoted.
5. **Minor phrasing risk:** “contact terms/counterterms are precisely diagonal \(\delta(x-y)\) (and derivatives)” is basically right at the kernel level, but could be softened to “appear as distributions supported on the diagonal” to avoid sounding scheme-independent beyond what is intended.

## Action Queue
1. `C`: optional micro-edit in `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` to soften “precisely” and (optionally) add a one-line relation between scalar Green functions (defined w.r.t. \(d^Dx\sqrt{|g|}\)) and the half-density Green kernel (defined w.r.t. \(d^Dx\)).
2. `B`: if BV half-densities are promoted beyond outlook, open a dedicated bibliography cycle and ingest authoritative references.

## Status
Completed.
