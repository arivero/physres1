# C116 Execution: Promote S78 Van Vleck × transmutation kernel-level separation

Date: 2026-02-12

## Summary
Added Remark PA-E5b (~3 lines) after PA-E5a in the Planck-area draft.

## Work log
1. Read PA-E5a (lines 311-316) to locate insertion point.
2. Inserted Remark PA-E5b after line 316, before §3.4.
3. Content: Lippmann–Schwinger factorization G = G₀ + G₀·T·G₀ shows Van Vleck = geometric transformation law (PA-H2.1) and κ* = dynamical scalarization constant (PA-H2.2–H2.4). Structurally independent, combine multiplicatively.
4. Ran diffstat.

## Guard checks
- N/A (companion note, not paper/main.md).
- Extra check: no cycle tags in Planck-area file — clean.

## Outputs
- Manuscripts edited:
  - `papers/planck-area/main.md` (Remark PA-E5b, after PA-E5a)

## Spawned cycles
- `Q71`: referee pass on C116
