# C57 Plan: Promote S30 Covariant-Area Outlook

## Goal
Promote the S30 result into `papers/planck-area/main.md` as a short remark clarifying limits of simple frame-free bivector invariants.

## Scope
- Add one compact remark after D1.5d.
- Keep content limited to: \(I_1,I_2\) definition, circular-branch reduction, and implication.

## Acceptance Tests
- Includes explicit formulas for \(I_1\), \(I_2\), and circular reduction.
- States conclusion without overreach (“simple invariants insufficient in this setup”).
- `cycles/C57-execution.md` includes diffstat via `scripts/paper-diffstat.sh --cached`.
