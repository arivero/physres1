# C115 Red Team: Failure modes for PA-E5a hierarchy remark

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes

- **Cross-paper references may confuse readers:**
  - Mitigation: PA-E5a references main-paper blocks (D6.2a-sg, P6.2, "Section 8.4") using the same label convention already established in the companion note. The Planck-area draft already cross-references the main paper in multiple places (PA-D1.4 references "Section 6", PA-H1.1 references "Section 6", etc.). Consistent with existing practice.

- **"Three-level hierarchy" is too schematic:**
  - Mitigation: each level is accompanied by a specific witness (D6.2a-sg / 2D delta / PA-D1.3), so the hierarchy is grounded in concrete computations rather than abstract assertions.

- **"Transmutation does not sieve dimensions" could discourage the reader:**
  - Mitigation: the remark frames this neutrally — it says transmutation "supplies a scale in any d where a marginal coupling exists" and that the half-density weight "correctly tracks the geometric type." The message is informative (what the mechanism does), not deflationary (what it doesn't).

- **The remark is too long for an "example" subsection:**
  - Mitigation: PA-E5a is labeled as a Remark, not an Example. The subsection already contains remarks (PA-E4a) of similar length. Consistent with existing practice.
