## Failure modes

### 1. Trivial content
- Risk: a referee could say "everyone knows fermions have Grassmann sources."
- Mitigation: the paper's value is not the observation itself but the precise isolation of where the bosonic story breaks down, plus the explicit contact-kernel replacement. This is useful as a record for the program's internal consistency.

### 2. Lecture note as reference
- Risk: [Floerchinger2024QFT1Lecture21] is a lecture webpage, not a peer-reviewed source.
- Mitigation: the cited fact (Grassmann sources in the generating functional) is standard textbook material. The lecture note is cited for the explicit statement, not for priority. Any standard QFT textbook (Peskin–Schroeder, Weinberg, Srednicki) says the same thing.
