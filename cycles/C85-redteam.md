# C85 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Seen as textbook**: readers think this is just "relativistic expansion" with no foundational value.
2. **Vacuum-energy confusion**: readers infer constant shifts are always irrelevant (not true in QFT/GR).
3. **Scope creep**: the manuscript drifts into relativistic/QFT details too early.

## Mitigations
1. Tie the derivation explicitly to limit existence/compatibility language (not pedagogy).
2. Keep the statement local: "for particle mechanics, constant shift does not change E-L; in quantum it is a global phase" (no broader claims).
3. Keep the block short and self-contained; no new sections.
