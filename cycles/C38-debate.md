# C38 Debate

## Question
Should we standardize the sign conventions by explicitly stating the \(+i0\) rule once in the RG draft’s convention map, or just fix the formulas silently?

## Working Resolution
Fix the formulas and (if needed) add one short reminder line in the convention map: \(1/(x+i0)=\mathrm{PV}(1/x)-i\pi\delta(x)\).
