# D27 Debate: Is “odd \(d\) blocks universality” actually a feature?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
If odd \(d\) forces half-integer \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scales, is that an argument *against* universal scalarization, or a clue that universality must proceed via transmutation/non-analyticity rather than monomials?

## Working answer
It may be a feature: it cleanly separates “analytic monomial sieve” claims (where \(d=4\) is special) from “transmutation supplies a scale” claims (which are intrinsically non-analytic). The repo should not mix these hypotheses.

## Next check
Produce an explicit odd-\(d\) witness (or show why such a witness necessarily uses fractional/non-analytic dependence).
