# Q182 Debate: Is this too much detail for Section 3?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Should the threshold line be removed from the main text to keep Section 3 purely on area-law invariants?

## Resolution
No. The inserted content is compact and clarifies a common Newton/SR confusion while preserving the section's primary flow.
