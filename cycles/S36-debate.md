# S36 Debate: Is First-Order Propagation Adequate?

## Question
Does first-order linear uncertainty propagation suffice for strongly nonlinear orbital reconstructions?

## Current Resolution
Use it as baseline only:
- first-order Jacobian propagation is transparent and lightweight;
- for high-curvature regimes or long extrapolations, upgrade path should include Monte Carlo/unscented propagation.
