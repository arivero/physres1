# Q28 Plan: Quality Pass on RG Section 3 (H1.1c)

## Goal
Check readability and claim hygiene after adding weak variational-derivative remark H1.1c.

## Checks
1. Read Section 3 flow from H1.1 through H1.1c.
2. Verify H1.1c is framed as structural analogy/pattern, not a framework identity claim.
3. Ensure transition into Section 4 remains smooth.
4. Run guardrail scan on `paper/main.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- No contradiction with existing RG narrative.
- No overclaim language in H1.1c.
- Guardrail scan remains clean.
