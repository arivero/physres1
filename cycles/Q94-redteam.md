## Failure modes
1. **Referee objection: "this is just the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations"**: True, Theorem 2.1 is standard. Mitigation: the paper's contribution is not the theorem but the packaging — explicit hypotheses, worked model, and the safe-vs-unsafe taxonomy, which is pedagogically valuable.
2. **Only 3 references**: Could be perceived as thin. Mitigation: add references in a future B cycle if needed. Current references are well-chosen.
