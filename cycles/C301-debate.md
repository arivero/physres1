# C301 Debate

Date: 2026-02-14

## Hard question
Does the new Remark H1.2a add substantive content, or is it redundant with the existing H1.1a hedge?

## Current resolution
It adds precision. H1.1a discusses the historical debate (Nauenberg vs Pourciau) and provides a general hedge. H1.2a provides the explicit mathematical criterion (Lipschitz force) for when the limit exists, identifies the specific failure mode (r=0 collision), and names the required regularization techniques. The two remarks are complementary: H1.1a acknowledges the subtlety, H1.2a quantifies it.
