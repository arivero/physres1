# S147 Plan: Lattice gauge theory as refinement limit

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study Wilson's lattice gauge theory as the definitive physical realization of the "uncuttable" refinement pattern, for promotion into uncuttable satellite Section 4.

## Steps
1. Write blackboard 0: lattice gauge theory — plaquette action, link variables, exact gauge invariance, asymptotic freedom, confinement.
2. Launch reviewer subagent (lattice QCD practitioner persona).
3. Incorporate corrections and promote to Remark 4.3 in uncuttable paper.
