## Failure Modes
1. “Branch confusion”: the reader cannot tell which conclusions belong to which H2.5 reading.
2. “Dimension confusion”: spatial vs spacetime dimension is mixed inside the sieve argument.
3. “Citation mismatch”: new references are added but do not support the precise statement.

## Mitigations
- Use explicit sublabels (H2.5a/H2.5b) and a short branch-summary paragraph.
- Keep a single “dimension bookkeeping” line near the relevant derivations.
- For each new citation, ensure the surrounding sentence is something the source actually supports.
