# C69 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Bibliography debt:** remark implies specific QFT formalism without anchors.
2. **Scope creep:** half-density QFT note grows into a nonequilibrium-QFT review.
3. **Reader confusion:** density operator language appears without context.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the remark strictly kernel-level and self-contained.
2. Limit to one equation and one sentence of interpretation.
3. Use minimal operator definition (\(\rho_t=U_t\rho_0U_t^{-1}\)) and keep the rest formulaic.
