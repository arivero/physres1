# S79 Plan: Odd-dimension obstruction — half-density weight length^{d/2} for odd d

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Investigate what happens to the PA-H2.5a integrality sieve in odd dimensions. Address Planck-area draft open problem #3: "General-dimension analysis: clarify what replaces 'area' in odd dimensions and whether a universal normalization is still defensible."

## Question
For odd d, the half-density weight length^{d/2} has a half-integer exponent. Can any monomial in standard couplings (which have integer length dimensions) match this target?

## Method
1. Check parity: for odd d, is d/2 ever an integer? No — it's always a half-integer.
2. Check whether sums of integer multiples of integer coupling dimensions can yield a half-integer. No — the sum is always an integer.
3. Enumerate even-d cases for gravity-only and gravity+Λ to contrast.
4. Note the fermionic escape route (half-integer coupling dimensions) without developing it.
5. Connect to the three-level hierarchy: transmutation (level 2) bypasses the parity obstruction.

## Expected output
- Blackboard note with the analysis.
- Structural classification: parity obstruction (odd d), magnitude obstruction (even d ≥ 6), degenerate case (d = 2).
