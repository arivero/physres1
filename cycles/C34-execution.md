# C34 Execution

## Status
Completed.

## Changes
1. `papers/half-density-qft/main.md`
   - Started a new follow-up draft making the “kernel as bi-half-density” semantics explicit for QFT spacetime propagators.
   - Included an explicit worked computation: densitized scalar field \(\psi=|g|^{1/4}\phi\) and the conjugated kinetic operator \(\widetilde P=|g|^{1/4}P|g|^{-1/4}\), with a short symmetry check.
   - Recorded the kernel-level remark that local counterterms/contact terms are diagonal \(\delta(x-y)\) pieces (and derivatives) in the kernel, naturally expressed using the canonical bi-half-density delta.
2. `papers/README.md`
   - Listed the new draft (and the existing delta-objects draft) under follow-up manuscripts.
