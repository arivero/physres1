# S09 Debate

## Question
Is it legitimate to interpret dimensional transmutation as “providing the missing scalarization scale” for point-supported half-densities, or is that mixing convention with physics?

## Working Resolution
Phrase it as a conditional bookkeeping observation:
half-densities make the delta kernel canonical, but any scalar representative requires a scale choice; in marginal cases the RG-invariant scale \(\kappa_\ast\) is the only available length and can therefore serve as the scalarization scale if one adopts a universality hypothesis. Keep the distinction explicit.
