# B09 Execution: OA Anchor for Fermionic (Grassmann) Sources

Date: 2026-02-10

## Work performed
- Added an OA lecture-page anchor that explicitly states the Dirac-fermion generating functional \(Z[\bar\eta,\eta]\) with Grassmann-valued sources, and ingested it into `sources/`.

## Keys updated
- `[Floerchinger2024QFT1Lecture21]`: added (OA lecture page; used to anchor “fermionic sources are Grassmann”).

## Artifacts produced
- `paper/bibliography.md`: updated
- `sources/lecture21-2cc5b4d3.md`: added (OA capture)

## Notes for promotion
- Intended citation points (future `C87`):
  - define the fermionic generating functional with Grassmann sources,
  - justify the statement “no ordinary commuting classical source couples linearly to a fermion field.”
