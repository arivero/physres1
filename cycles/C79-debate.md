# C79 Debate: Keep the \(n=4\) Degenerate Case in the Remark?

## Question
Should `Remark D1.5a` mention the \(n=4\) / \(q=3\) degenerate case, or is that too distracting?

## Current Resolution
Keep it in one clause: it prevents readers from misapplying the \(r\) formula at \(q=3\), and it reinforces that the dimension dependence is not purely a stylistic choice.
