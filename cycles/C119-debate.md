# C119 Debate: planck-area standalone cleanup

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Is removing the conformal-rescaling derivation reference (line 157) acceptable when the result is simply stated without proof?

## Resolution
Yes. The formula is a standard computation (conformal transformation of the scalar Laplacian). "A direct computation gives" is the standard phrasing for results that a reader can verify. The original derivation is in a separate note; inlining it would add ~20 lines of routine algebra. Not worth it for a preprint.
