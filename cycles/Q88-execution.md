## action-angle-indeterminacy

### Verification
- YAML metadata: filled ✓
- Bibliography: 2 references ✓
- Encoding: clean ✓
- Internal paths: none ✓
- Math: clean (verified in Q86) ✓
- Content: 75 lines, makes one clean point with one worked example ✓

### Assessment
**READY for Tier 1.** The paper is a focused "referee-safe witness" that achieves its stated scope. Promote.

### Verification
- YAML metadata: filled ✓
- Bibliography: 2 references ✓
- Encoding: clean ✓
- Internal paths: fixed (no more `paper/main.md` or "repo" language) ✓
- Math: clean (standard Riemann sums and action principle) ✓

### Content assessment
59 lines, mostly definitional. The paper defines "uncuttable" and gives two toy models. Section 4 (outlook) lists the half-density / control-map / renormalization connections but doesn't develop them.

### Assessment
**Borderline Tier 1.** The paper is structurally clean and self-contained. It makes its definitional point clearly. The content is thin but complete for what it claims.

**Decision: promote to Tier 1.** Rationale:
1. All structural issues (paths, encoding, metadata, bibliography) are resolved.
2. The paper is honest about its scope — it's a "small conceptual bridge" (line 53).
3. A preprint server is for working papers, not journal publications. This meets that bar.
4. If a reviewer objects to thinness, a C cycle can expand. But the current version is publishable as-is.

## Summary
Both papers promoted to Tier 1. **All 8 satellite papers now at Tier 1.** Tier 2 and Tier 3 are empty.
