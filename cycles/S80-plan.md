# S80 Plan: D(4-D)/4 vanishing vs integrality sieve — independence check

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Determine whether the D(4-D)/4 operator-simplicity filter (H4.0b / HD-D1.3) is logically independent of the integrality sieve (PA-D1.3 / PA-D1.3a). If independent, identify the common origin that makes them agree at D=4.

## Question
Both filters select D=4. Are they the same filter in disguise, or genuinely independent? What is the structural relationship?

## Method
1. State each filter's hypotheses and objects.
2. Check whether either implies the other.
3. Identify the common quantity both probe.
4. Connect to the RCP legs (scale vs representation compatibility).

## Expected output
- Blackboard note with the independence argument and structural summary.
