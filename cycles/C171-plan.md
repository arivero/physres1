# C171 Plan: Squeezed states Remark 6.5 in action-angle

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Promote S130 blackboard (squeezed states as action-angle asymmetry) as Remark 6.5 in action-angle satellite.

## Target manuscripts (must edit ≥1)
- `paper/main.md` (no)
- `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Remark 6.5 after Remark 6.4 (Husimi), before Section 7 (Outlook)
- ~3 lines: squeezed states interpolate between Fock ring and coherent blob; amplitude vs phase squeezing; continuous family parametrized by squeeze parameter

Out of scope:
- Formulas for the squeeze operator or Husimi function (keep structural)
- LIGO/Virgo mention (too applied for this paper's scope)
- Bibliography additions

## Acceptance criteria
- Action-angle manuscript changed (substantively).
- Diffstat recorded in `cycles/C171-execution.md`.
- Guard check passes.
