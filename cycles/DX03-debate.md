# DX03 Debate: Are the two ordering-control mechanisms genuinely independent?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Section 7 frames ordering as a deformation-equivalence gauge choice. D9.1a (Appendix 10.2) shows that half-density conjugation selects a canonical ordering for kinetic operators. Are these independent mechanisms, or is one a special case of the other?

## Current position
They are **complementary**, not competing:
- Deformation equivalence is the **quotient structure**: it says all orderings with the same Poisson bracket are gauge-related.
- Half-density geometry is a **section of that quotient**: it selects the unique representative whose scalar Laplacian has no first-derivative term.
Together, they constitute a "gauge group + gauge fixing" pair. The framing is consistent.

## What would change my mind?
- A computation showing that the half-density-preferred ordering is NOT related to the Weyl ordering by a gauge/similarity transformation in the deformation framework. (This would indicate genuine inconsistency.)
- A toy model where semigroup composition (D4.1a-style) selects a DIFFERENT ordering from the half-density conjugation. (This would indicate that the partition and representation legs of RCP give conflicting instructions.)

Neither of these is expected, but a dedicated S-cycle could verify with an explicit model.

## Relationship to the North Star
This debate directly touches RCP: it asks whether the "representation" leg (deformation equivalence) and the "partition/composition" leg (half-density from composition law) give consistent answers. The current evidence says yes — they are two views of the same structure — which reinforces RCP rather than challenging it.
