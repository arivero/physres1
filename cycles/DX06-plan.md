# DX06 Plan: Post-planck-area-strengthening structural sweep

Date: 2026-02-13

## Context
14 cycles since DX05, all on planck-area thread. Three open problems addressed (PA-D1.4a, PA-E5c, PA-H2.6b). Time to sweep for cross-thread effects and assess priorities.

## Goals
1. Check if main paper (paper/main.md) needs updates to reflect new planck-area results.
2. Check if rg-fundamental needs updates (it references half-density work).
3. Probe anomaly register.
4. Assess whether the principle evolution log (RCP v4) needs updating.
5. Identify next priority thread.
