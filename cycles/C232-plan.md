# C232 Plan: Promote Remark 4.11 into uncuttable paper

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Promote corrected constructive QFT blackboard into uncuttable paper as Remark 4.11 capstone.

## Target manuscripts (must edit ≥1)
- `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Remark 4.11 after Remark 4.10, before concluding paragraph of Section 4
- Remark: Constructive QFT—do the refinement limits exist?
- Add 3 new bibliography entries: GlimmJaffe1987, Aizenman1981, Frohlich1982 (refnum #33-35)

Out of scope:
- Edits to other sections or manuscripts

## Minimum promotion bar
This remark adds ~9 lines to Section 4, creating a natural capstone that asks whether RG refinement limits rigorously exist, grounding the section's theoretical claims in contemporary mathematical physics.

## Allowed files
- `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md`
- `paper/bibliography.md` (only for adding the 3 new entries, not reordering)
- `cycles/C232-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `sources/`, `docs/`
