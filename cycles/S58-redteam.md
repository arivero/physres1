# S58 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Too abstract**: the lemma becomes a slogan without operational meaning.
2. **Notation drift**: "refine" vs "coarse-grain" language confuses readers.
3. **Overclaiming invariance**: implying \(\tau_b\) itself is unique/physical.

## Mitigations
1. Keep at least one explicit, computed witness (step-halving) attached to the lemma.
2. Use "compare at fixed ruler" consistently as the primitive operation.
3. State scheme dependence explicitly; talk about invariants (fixed points, exponents) instead.
