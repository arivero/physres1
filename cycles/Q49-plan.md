# Q49 Plan: Submission-Readiness Referee Pass on Main Paper (Post-C92)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C92`: removed internal `PENDING` process metadata line from `paper/main.md`

## Goal
Referee-pass the current `paper/main.md` for foundations-journal submission readiness: reader flow, claim hygiene, notation clarity, and removal of any remaining editorial/repo-specific meta-language.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q49-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`
- `docs/`

## Checklist
- No operational/repo-process metadata in prose.
- Section/appendix transitions read as a standalone paper (no “earlier version” language).
- Claim taxonomy remains consistent (Proposition/Derivation/Heuristic).
- Citations: load-bearing claims anchored or explicitly scoped.
- Notation: \(d\) vs \(D\), \(\mathcal C/\mathcal Q/\mathcal R\) usage consistent.

## Acceptance criteria
- Concrete follow-ups expressed as spawned `C/S/B/D` cycles (no direct edits).
