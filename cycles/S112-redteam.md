## Failure modes
1. **Too trivial**: A referee might say "of course the free particle works — it's Gaussian." Mitigated by framing as "making D4.2a explicit" rather than claiming deep content. The example's value is pedagogical: it shows the mechanism concretely before the reader encounters harder cases.
2. **O(ℏ ln ℏ) correction**: The subleading term is O(ℏ ln ℏ), not O(ℏ). This is standard for Laplace-method corrections in 1D and is correctly stated in the text.
