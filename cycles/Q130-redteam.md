# Q130 — Red Team

## Failure mode
The Q cycle only caught a notation issue, not a mathematical error.
This could indicate the review was too superficial.

## Mitigation
The reviewer explicitly checked all 6 steps of the derivation, the
iff claim, the Seeley-DeWitt connection, and the significance level.
The absence of mathematical errors is a positive signal, not a gap in
the review. The notation fix is genuinely useful for reader experience.
