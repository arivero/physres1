# S31 Plan: Minimal Timelike Structure for Areal Postulates

## Goal
Determine the minimal additional structure needed to make areal-rate postulates covariant yet informative, after S29/S30.

## Scope
1. Formalize observer/source-dependent decomposition of orbital bivector \(M^{\mu\nu}\).
2. Identify what data is recovered by:
   - no timelike direction,
   - source worldline 4-velocity \(U^\mu\),
   - generic observer field \(u^\mu(x)\).
3. State a minimal-structure rule for the current central-source model.

## Acceptance Tests
- Explicit formula for \(\ell_{(u)}\) requiring \(u^\mu\).
- Clear statement of why frame-free invariants are insufficient and source-anchored choice is minimal.
