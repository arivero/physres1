## Failure Modes
1. The micro-edit introduces new physics claims (about strings) beyond dimensional analysis.
2. The revised wording makes it unclear what is being admitted as a coupling under H2.7a.

## Mitigations
- Keep the content purely dimensional and clearly conditional (“suppose a universal area parameter exists”).
- Keep “string UV completion” content explicitly heuristic and non-load-bearing.
