## Risks
1. Over-generalization that yields no clean manuscript-facing result.
2. Spending effort on exotic `A(L)` forms with no physics relevance.

## Mitigations
1. Prioritize simple monotone/non-monotone families only.
2. Stop if no compact condition emerges after first command-backed scan.

## Iteration 2 addendum
3. Always check whether the sampled/physical range of \(A(L)\) actually brackets \(B\).

## Iteration 3 addendum
4. Risk: claiming global uniqueness from local scans.
5. Mitigation: always report both global and windowed crossing counts, plus window range-bracketing status.
