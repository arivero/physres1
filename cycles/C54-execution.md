# C54 Execution: Promote SR Continuation into Planck-Area Draft

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5b` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` as a direct continuation of D1.5/D1.5a.
- Promoted the inverse-square fixed-areal-speed SR formula and its gravitational specialization, including:
  - the \(\dot A_0\)-dependent closed expression \(r(M,\dot A_0)\),
  - the \(\dot A_0=cL_P\) interpolation formula,
  - the two limiting regimes (Compton-like branch and \(2L_P\) saturation).
- Kept scope discipline explicit: model-level mechanical SR with external inverse-square force.
