# Q12 Debate: How Explicit Should \(\tau\) Be in the Cornerstone Paper?

## Tension
More explicit \(\tau\) machinery improves rigor but risks distracting from the manuscript’s spine.

## Resolution
Keep \(\tau\) at the “one boxed equation + one paragraph” level:
it should clarify what “compare discretizations/refinements” means, and then immediately return to the already-established RG semigroup narrative.
