# D49 Discovery: P4.2 ↔ RCP Axiom Mapping

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent thread: Open Question #2 (minimal axiom set for RCP)

## Novelty target
Map the P4.2 ℏ-necessity theorem's three effective hypotheses — (C) composition,
(I) identity limit, (D) dimensional homogeneity — onto the RCP axiom system A1–A5 in
the rcp-foundations satellite. Determine whether the mapping is clean (bijective) or
reveals structural gaps/redundancies.

## Motivation
- P4.2 reduced from 4 to ~3 hypotheses (D29+D39): (L_exp) and (L_loc) are derivable
- RCP axioms: A1 (composition), A2 (identity), A3 (representation equivalence),
  A4 (scale invariance), A5 (dimensional homogeneity)
- Question: Does P4.2's (C)+(I)+(D) correspond to A1+A2+A5? What role do A3 and A4 play?
- If the mapping is clean, P4.2 becomes a **theorem of the partition channel** of RCP
- If there are gaps, they identify what additional structure the full RCP provides

## Success criteria
1. Explicit table mapping P4.2 hypotheses → RCP axioms (or identifying non-correspondences)
2. Statement of whether P4.2 is a theorem of A1+A2+A5 alone, or requires additional structure
3. Identification of what A3 (representation) and A4 (scale) add beyond P4.2

any slot is available).

## Context search
Before starting, search papers/rcp-foundations/main.md for axiom definitions and
papers/path-integral-normalization/main.md for P4.2 connections.
