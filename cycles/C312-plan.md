# C312 Plan: P4.2 Hypothesis Reduction + Extensions + Deformation Correction

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Promote the day's major discoveries (D29-D39) into the cornerstone paper: hypothesis reduction for P4.2, extensions to curved/interacting/Lorentzian settings, kappa-universality, and the four-layer deformation equivalence correction.

## Target manuscripts (must edit >=1)
- `paper/main.md` (yes)
- `papers/<name>/main.md` (no)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Remarks P4.2c, P4.2d after P4.2b: exponential weight uniqueness theorem and Levy obstruction
- Add Remark P4.2e: extensions to curved, interacting, Lorentzian settings
- Add Remark P4.2f: universality of kappa across interacting sectors
- Correct Remark D9.1a: four-layer stratification replacing incorrect "eliminates first-derivative" claim
- Include explicit energy-shift estimate from D38/S294

Out of scope:
- Full notebook-level derivations (stay in notebooks/blackboards)
- Satellite paper edits (frozen at page limits)

## Minimum promotion bar (preferably verbose)
This cycle adds 4 new remarks (P4.2c-f) plus one major correction to D9.1a. Each remark is paragraph-level with mathematical content. Total: +16/-1 lines in paper/main.md. Meets promotion bar.

## Allowed files
- `paper/main.md`

- `cycles/Cxx-*.md`

## Forbidden files
