## Hard question
Does adding a 1D harmonic oscillator example weaken the paper's "central potential" focus?
## Resolution
No. The paper's thesis is about action–angle indeterminacy in general, and the title mentions "central potentials" as the safest/cleanest witness. The HO example is explicitly introduced as a "second witness" in a different setting (1D vs 3D), which strengthens the universality of the claim rather than diluting it.
