# Q173 Debate: Is the Package B claim still too broad?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does adding only the periodic-domain witness risk implying Package B is fully closed?

## Recommendation
No, because Section 9.5 explicitly marks this as a starter witness and keeps curved-manifold/operator-classification work open.
