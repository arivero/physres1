# Q71 Debate: Does PA-E5b conflate exact resolvent with semiclassical approximation?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
PA-E5b says G₀ "carries the Van Vleck half-density weight at its endpoint (Derivation PA-D1.4)." But PA-D1.4 proves the Van Vleck prefactor is a bi-half-density in the *semiclassical* (stationary-phase) approximation, while G₀ is the *exact* free resolvent. Is this a conflation?

## Recommendation
No conflation. The exact free resolvent kernel IS a bi-half-density — it is the Schwartz kernel of a bounded operator on the half-density Hilbert space L²(M, |Ω|^{1/2}). The Van Vleck prefactor is the semiclassical *approximation* to this exact object. PA-E5b's reference to PA-D1.4 is shorthand for "the half-density weight that PA-D1.4 makes explicit in the semiclassical case." A pedantic reader might prefer "each G₀ factor is a bi-half-density in its endpoint variables (the Van Vleck prefactor of PA-D1.4 being its semiclassical approximation)," but this level of detail is unnecessary for the remark's purpose. No change needed.
