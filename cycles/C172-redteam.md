## Findings
Mathematical physicist (self-adjoint extensions specialist) reviewed blackboard 0.
Key correction incorporated: even d=1 requires extension theory (UV-finite, but
still a boundary-condition datum, not a "plain coupling constant").
Claims 2-4 (d=2 log, d=3 linear, d=2 marginal): all CORRECT.
The promoted remark incorporates the reviewer's improved framing.
