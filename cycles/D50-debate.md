# D50 Debate: Is (D) derivable from (C)?

## Main claim
(D) is derivable from (C) + physical setup. P4.2 needs only 2 mathematical axioms.

## For
- The proof of (D₁) is elementary: [K]²·[L]^d = [K] → [K] = L^{-d}
- (D₂) is trivially true for any dimensional theory
- (D₃) is a property of the Lagrangian, not an axiom about kernels
- This simplification strengthens the "composition forces everything" thesis

## Against / caveats
1. **"Action-based dynamics" is doing heavy lifting.** Calling it "physical setup" rather than a "hypothesis" is partly semantic. A skeptic could argue it's the third hypothesis in disguise.
   - Response: Fair, but "the dynamics comes from a Lagrangian" is the STARTING POINT of P4.2, stated in the first sentence ("Let M=ℝ^d with Lagrangian L..."). It's not a hypothesis about kernels; it's the premise. Hypotheses (C), (I), (D) are additional conditions ON the kernels.

2. **The Lévy exclusion argument changes.** Previously: α≠2 excluded by dimensional obstruction (D39). Revised: excluded because action-based → Gaussian (D29). But D29 applies only to translation-invariant kernels.
   - Response: For general kernels, the short-time limit reduces to the free (translation-invariant) case. D36/S293 confirms this for interacting systems. So D29 applies in the short-time regime.

3. **Does this change anything operationally?** P4.2 still proves the same things. The hypothesis count change is "bookkeeping."
   - Response: It matters for the RCP narrative. If (D) is not independent, then A5 has no partition-channel content — its only role is in representation and scale channels. This makes the channel decomposition even cleaner.

## Resolution
The reduction is valid but should be presented carefully: (D) is derivable from (C) + premises, not from (C) alone. The "action-based dynamics" setup is substantive and should not be hidden.
