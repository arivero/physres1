# S30 Execution: Limits of Frame-Free Bivector Invariants

## Work Completed
- Studied the orbital bivector
  \[
  M^{\mu\nu}=R^\mu p^\nu-R^\nu p^\mu
  \]
  with invariants
  \[
  I_1=\frac12 M_{\mu\nu}M^{\mu\nu}=R^2p^2-(R\!\cdot\!p)^2,
  \qquad
  I_2=\frac12 M_{\mu\nu}\,{}^\star M^{\mu\nu}.
  \]
- For circular central motion with \(R\cdot p=0\), \(R^2=r^2\), \(p^2=-m^2c^2\):
  \[
  I_1=-m^2c^2r^2,
  \]
  which is independent of orbital speed \(v\), while \(I_2\) vanishes in the planar setup.

## Result
The simplest frame-free Lorentz invariants of \(M^{\mu\nu}\) do not encode areal-rate data for circular orbits. To recover the physically relevant branch parameter (\(\gamma rv\) / areal speed), one must project relative to a timelike direction (e.g. source 4-velocity \(U^\mu\)) and use the projected spatial bivector, as in S29.
