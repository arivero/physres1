# C28 Debate

## Question
Do we need to “fix coupling coordinates” explicitly in a physics paper, or can we say it in a lightweight way that still blocks the trivial loophole?

## Working Resolution
Add a short heuristic: couplings are those appearing in the local action after canonical field normalization, and we only allow analytic reparametrizations near a chosen base point. Explicitly exclude \(\mu\)/cutoffs and the scalarization scale \(L_\ast\).
