# C37 Debate

## Question
Should we explicitly enumerate the distributional order cases (jump → \(\delta\), impulse → \(\delta\), differentiated impulse → \(\delta'\), etc.), or keep it as a single conservative sentence?

## Working Resolution
Keep it as a single conservative sentence and point to the toolbox note for details.
