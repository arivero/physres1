# S33 Execution: Non-Planar Extension (Vector Form)

## Work Completed
- Derived the 3D kinematic identities for arbitrary trajectories:
  \[
  \boldsymbol\ell:=\frac1m(\mathbf r\times\mathbf p)=\gamma(\mathbf r\times\mathbf v),
  \]
  \[
  \frac{d\mathbf A}{dt}:=\frac12(\mathbf r\times\mathbf v),
  \qquad
  \frac{d\mathbf A}{d\tau}=\gamma\frac{d\mathbf A}{dt}=\frac{\boldsymbol\ell}{2}.
  \]
- Identified the non-planar implication:
  - vector/bivector relation is kinematic and always valid;
  - a scalar areal rate needs a chosen unit normal \(\mathbf n\), giving
    \[
    \frac{dA_{\mathbf n}}{d\tau}=\frac{\boldsymbol\ell\cdot\mathbf n}{2}.
    \]
- Recorded that under non-central perturbations \(\boldsymbol\ell\) generally precesses or changes magnitude, so “constant areal speed” must be interpreted as a condition on projected or vector areal rate, not a universal scalar.

## Result
The \(\ell\)-rule survives non-planar perturbations in vector form, but scalar statements require an explicit plane/normal choice. This gives a clean cautionary promotion target for C60.
