# S299 Execution: RCP Foundations Scope Map + Classical Example

## What was computed
**Deliverable 1:** Three compatibility channels (partition, representation, scale) with operational definitions and witnesses

**Deliverable 2:** 5-axiom framework (A1-A5)
- A1: Composition law
- A2: Identity limit
- A3: Representation equivalence
- A4: Scale invariance
- A5: Dimensional homogeneity

**Deliverable 3:** Noether's theorem worked example (partition channel)
- Setup: action functional + symmetry group
- Theorem: symmetry → conserved charge Q
- RCP interpretation: Q is compatibility datum τ_C(θ)
- Discrete → continuum: partition refinement preserves conservation

**Deliverable 4:** Scope map for 6-9pp paper (7 sections)

## Blackboard location
Slot 2 (143 lines, under 300-line limit)

## Next step
C319: draft initial RCP paper in `papers/rcp-foundations/main.md`

## Key insight
RCP is **falsifiable**: closure can fail when no admissible parameter update exists. P4.2 is constructive witness (partition closure forces ℏ, both limits fail).
