# C66 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Analogy overstatement:** reads as "RG equals weak derivatives."
2. **Notation jump:** sudden introduction of \(p,\eta\) without context.
3. **Sign ambiguity:** contact-term sign confusion.

## Mitigations
1. Keep wording explicitly "same grammar/pattern."
2. Keep remark short and local to Section 3.
3. State the jump-to-delta term with convention tied to the displayed weak pairing.
