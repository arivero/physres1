# Q43 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Stationary/minimum confusion**: readers think the paper switched principles midstream.
2. **Signature confusion**: readers think Euclideanization is required for foundations.
3. **Overclaiming**: readers infer we have a rigorous path integral measure.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the Euclidean witness explicitly labeled and avoid "Newtonian minimum" wording.
2. State the witness is about the refinement-composition pattern, not Wick rotation.
3. Retain the existing disclaimer that the full path-space integral is formal here.
