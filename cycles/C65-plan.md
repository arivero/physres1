# C65 Plan: Promote Regime-Dependent Trigger Calibration

## Goal
Promote the S38 robustness result into a concise manuscript qualifier after D1.5l.

## Scope
- Add one short remark clarifying that nonlinear-escalation thresholds are regime-dependent.
- Introduce a minimal calibration diagnostic that can be reported in practice.

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript edit is substantive.
- Language avoids universal-threshold overclaim.
- `cycles/C65-execution.md` logs manuscript diffstat.
