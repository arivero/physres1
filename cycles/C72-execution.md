# C72 Execution: Clarify String-Tension vs UV Area-Parameter Branches

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark E4a` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` near Example E4.
- Clarified the two meanings of "string tension supplies an area scale":
  - a fundamental UV area parameter \(\alpha_\ast\),
  - an emergent IR string tension \(\sigma\) as an RG-invariant transmutation scale in \(d=4\).
- Positioned the emergent-\(\sigma\) reading in the H2.13 transmutation branch (hypothesis bookkeeping).
