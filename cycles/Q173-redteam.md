# Q173 Red Team: Referee attacks on C290

Date: 2026-02-14

## Likely referee objections
- "Symmetry on a chosen domain is weaker than full self-adjointness."
  - Mitigation: already addressed explicitly in `Remark D9.1c`.
- "Model is too special (`S^1`) to claim full ordering resolution."
  - Mitigation: Section 9.5 labels it as starter closure and keeps curved-manifold extension as open Package B work.
