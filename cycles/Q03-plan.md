# Q03 Plan

## Goal
Quickly sanity-check the cornerstone manuscript after `C30`:
ensure Section 5.5 (“Extremal Measures”) remains concise and that D3.5 and D3.5a read as a single coherent unit.

## Scope
1. `paper/main.md` (read-only in this cycle)
2. Record findings/action items in `cycles/Q03-execution.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `cycles/Q03-execution.md` lists any actionable edits tagged by cycle type.
2. No manuscript edits performed in this cycle.
