# Q19 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5e

## Goal
Referee-style review after adding D1.5e:
- consistency across branches,
- clarity on assumptions,
- no universality overclaim.

## Checks
1. Read-through of D1.5b-D1.5e.
2. Symbolic sanity for D1.5e circular reduction \(I_1=-m^2c^2r^2\).
3. Guardrail scan of `paper/main.md` for cycle-label leakage.

## Acceptance Tests
- Branch relationships remain explicit and non-contradictory.
- No edits required, or fixes are made and logged.
