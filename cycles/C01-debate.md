# C01 Debate

## Claim
The finite-step central-impulse polygon model preserves angular momentum exactly, not approximately.

## Objection
Instantaneous impulses are unphysical and could make the result an artifact.

## Resolution
Keep impulse dynamics as a discrete scaffold only, then map the same invariant to smooth central forces by zero torque.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Equal areas in equal times can be shown directly from finite triangle areas.

## Objection
Area equalities might depend on equal-time discretization and fail in nonuniform slicing.

## Resolution
State equal-time discrete law explicitly, then formulate continuum invariant as \(\dot A=\|\mathbf L\|/(2m)\), which is slicing-independent in smooth time parameterization.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Areal invariance mechanism does not depend on inverse-power index \(n\).

## Objection
Different \(n\) produce qualitatively different orbit families.

## Resolution
Separate dynamical family differences (radial behavior) from invariance mechanism (central torque zero), and state this boundary explicitly.

## Status
Accepted.
