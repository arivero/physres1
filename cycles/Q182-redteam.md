# Q182 Redteam

## Failure modes
1. A reader might still read the threshold as a complete stability theorem.
2. Future edits could append extra caveats and bloat the paragraph.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the explicit asymptotic qualifiers in-place.
2. Treat this as frozen unless a referee asks for expansion.
