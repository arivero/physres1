## Hard question
Should we use the unitary E directly (via Cauchy-Schwarz for non-self-adjoint operators) or decompose into cos φ and sin φ?

**Decision**: Decompose into self-adjoint parts. The Cauchy-Schwarz route with E requires careful handling of z - z* for mixed self-adjoint/non-self-adjoint pairs, which is error-prone (the blackboard itself shows this confusion). The "add two Robertson" route only uses standard self-adjoint Robertson + the algebraic identity Var(cos φ)+Var(sin φ)=1-|⟨E⟩|², which is clean and unimpeachable.
