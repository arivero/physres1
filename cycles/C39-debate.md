# C39 Debate

## Question
Should we rename \(\alpha'\) to \(\alpha_\ast\) throughout the example, or keep \(\alpha'\) but explicitly label it “a universal area parameter”?

## Working Resolution
Introduce \(\alpha_\ast\) as the generic “universal area parameter” and mention string \(\alpha'\) as an example; keep the existing \(\alpha'\) notation in parentheticals to preserve reader familiarity.
