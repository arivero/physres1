# C59 Plan: Promote Non-Circular Extension Near D1.5f

## Goal
Promote S32 into the manuscript as a one-paragraph extension clarifying that the \(\ell\)-rule is not circular-only.

## Scope
- Add one compact remark after D1.5f with planar non-circular kinematic identities.
- Keep statement branch-scoped and force-law neutral.

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript includes explicit formulas for \(\ell\), \(dA/dt\), \(dA/d\tau\) in planar motion.
- `cycles/C59-execution.md` includes required manuscript diffstat.
