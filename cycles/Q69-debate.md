# Q69 Debate: Does the transmutation formula need a sign caveat?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The paragraph writes Λ* ~ μ exp(1/(cg)). In PA-D1.6a the formula is Λ* = μ exp(-∫^g dg'/β(g')). With β = -cg², the integral gives 1/(cg). But the sign of the exponent depends on whether β < 0 (asymptotic freedom) or β > 0 (infrared freedom). Should the paragraph add a sign caveat?

## Recommendation
No. The formula as written is correct for the sign convention in D6.2: β(g_R) = -cg_R² with c > 0 gives a positive exponent 1/(cg) > 0 for g > 0. The reader can verify this from D6.2 directly. Adding a sign discussion would distract from the structural point (linear vs nonlinear, algebraic vs essential singularity).
