# S01 Plan

## Goal
Blackboard the “half-density \(\Rightarrow\) universal scale” hypothesis branches with special focus on H2.5:
separate integrality, perturbative analyticity, and RG transmutation into distinct knobs, and map which “\(d=4\) area” statements survive each branch.

## Scope
1. Write one blackboard note in `blackboards/` that:
   - cleanly distinguishes H2.5 readings,
   - states what is invariant under coupling redefinitions,
   - records one toy example per branch (gravity-only, gravity+\(\Lambda\), transmutation).
2. Extract “promotion candidates” (small stable statements) to feed into `C22`/future content cycles.

## Risks
1. Turning blackboard work into prose prematurely.
2. Conflating “dimension sieve” with other “special dimension” mechanisms (division algebras, SUSY, holonomy).

## Acceptance Tests
1. A new `blackboards/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` note exists with the branch map and at least 3 promotion candidates.
2. No manuscript files are edited in this cycle.
