# C172 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Arguments for
- Synthesizes Examples 5.1 and 5.2 with d=1 comparison — the paper already has d=2 and d=3 but doesn't compare across dimensions
- Reviewer's correction (all d need extension theory, UV-finiteness is the distinction) aligns perfectly with Section 5's "boundary-condition reading" theme
- Compact (~3 lines), no new formulas needed

## Arguments against
- d=1 case isn't discussed elsewhere in the paper — but it's the natural baseline
- Could be seen as repetitive (Examples 5.1, 5.2 already contrast d=2 vs d=3) — but adding d=1 completes the picture

## Decision
Promote. The remark naturally synthesizes the existing examples.
