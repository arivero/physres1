# S134 Debate: Efimov effect

Date: 2026-02-13

## Pro
- Natural extension of the 2-body contact story (Section 5)
- Introduces a qualitatively new RG phenomenon (limit cycle vs fixed point)
- Shows that extension data hierarchy grows with particle number

## Con
- Efimov effect is for bosons; paper title mentions "fermionic mediators"
  → But the paper's scope is broader than fermions: Section 5 discusses contact
    interactions in general, and Remark 5.3 is about the unitary Fermi gas.
    The Efimov remark extends the contact/extension theme.

## Resolution
Promote as compact remark connecting to Remark 5.3's unitarity limit.
