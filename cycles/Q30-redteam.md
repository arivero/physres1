# Q30 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim reading:** "forces QM" interpreted as theorem.
2. **Vagueness:** "paradox" not tied to concrete math.
3. **Tone drift:** introduction becomes philosophy-heavy.

## Mitigations
1. Keep explicit program language ("treat as control mechanisms") rather than proof claims.
2. Name the concrete loci (singular probes, distributional derivatives, divergent refinement).
3. Limit to one compact paragraph; keep rest derivation-first.
