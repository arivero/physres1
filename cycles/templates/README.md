# Cycle Templates

These files are copy/rename templates for starting a new cycle.

Conventions:
- Replace `xx` with the next available two-digit number for that track.
- Keep cycle artifacts in `cycles/` (not in manuscripts).
- Only `Cnn` cycles may edit manuscripts (`paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`).
- `Qnn` cycles must name a parent `Cnn`.
