# Qxx Plan: <referee pass title>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Parent cycle (required)
- `Cyy`: <what diff is being reviewed>

## Goal
Referee-pass the parent `Cyy` manuscript changes for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Qxx-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries: theorem vs heuristic labels match content.
- Notation: consistent, no dimension mixups (`d` vs `D`).
- Citations: load-bearing claims are anchored or explicitly marked `PENDING` for a future `B`.
- Reader flow: one-screen sanity check (intro paragraph and transitions).

## Acceptance criteria
- A concrete list of edits to do next, expressed as spawned `S/B/C/D` cycles (not direct edits).
