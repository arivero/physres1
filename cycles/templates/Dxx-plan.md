# Dxx Plan: <discovery / novelty target>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Goal
Choose and define a novelty target (without editing manuscripts), then spawn the minimum next cycles needed to make it falsifiable/promotable.

## Novelty candidates (shortlist)
1. <candidate A>
2. <candidate B>

## Decision criteria
- <what makes this worth pursuing now>

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/Dxx-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- `Sxx`: one concrete derivation/computation witness
- `Bxx` (optional): acquire an independent anchor if the claim will be load-bearing
- `Cxx`: promotion wave (when ready)

## Acceptance criteria
- Exactly one chosen novelty target with a one-sentence claim + explicit scope disclaimer.
- A concrete next `S` cycle is opened (or clearly specified) with a 1–2 page deliverable.
