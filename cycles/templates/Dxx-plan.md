# Dxx Plan: <discovery / novelty target>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Goal
Choose and define a novelty target (without editing manuscripts), then spawn the minimum next cycles needed to make it falsifiable/promotable.

## Novelty candidates (shortlist)
1. <candidate A>
2. <candidate B>

## Decision criteria
- <what makes this worth pursuing now>

## What Goes Where
- `D` is triage: define the claim + scope, and specify the minimum *witness* needed.
- Do not park long derivations in `cycles/Dxx-*.md`.
- The witness derivation/computation must be done in an `S` cycle, written in `blackboards/<0-6>.md` (optionally promoted to `notebooks/`).
- Editorial drafting/polish belongs in `C` (or `P` for submission packaging), not in `D`.

## Allowed files (edit/write)
- `cycles/Dxx-*.md`
- `cycles/index.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md`

## Read-only references (if needed; never edit in D)
- Manuscripts/notes: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`, `paper/notes/`, `papers/*/notes/`
- Technical memory: `blackboards/`, `notebooks/`

## Forbidden files (do not edit)
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- `Sxx`: one concrete derivation/computation witness
  - Deliverable: 1–2 pages of math in `blackboards/<0-6>.md` (+ optional notebook promotion).
- `Bxx` (optional): acquire an independent anchor if the claim will be load-bearing
- `Cxx`: promotion wave (when ready)

## Acceptance criteria
- Exactly one chosen novelty target with a one-sentence claim + explicit scope disclaimer.
- A concrete next `S` cycle is opened (or clearly specified) with a bounded deliverable and a blackboard slot.
