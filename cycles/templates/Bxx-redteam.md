# Bxx Red Team: <bibliography failure modes>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Failure modes
- Source is not primary / is too derivative:
  - Mitigation: keep searching; mark as secondary only.
- Access problems:
  - Mitigation: leave `PENDING` with attempted URLs and next action.
- Citation does not support the claim as written:
  - Mitigation: narrow the claim or find a better anchor before promotion.
