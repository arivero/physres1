# DXxx Red Team: <exploration risks>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Failure modes
- Exploration is unfocused / produces no actionable signal:
  - Mitigation: require all four template sections to be answered; "nothing new" is a valid answer that closes the cycle cleanly.
- "Cross-thread connection" is pattern-matching on notation, not substance:
  - Mitigation: require at least one equation or concrete example if claiming a connection.
- Candidate principle is a restatement of the existing North Star:
  - Mitigation: compare explicitly to the principle evolution log; if it's already listed, mark it as "reinforced" rather than "new."
- Exploration eats cycles that should go to production:
  - Mitigation: DX cycles are bounded (one per ~10 cycles); they spawn S/D-triage, not C directly.
