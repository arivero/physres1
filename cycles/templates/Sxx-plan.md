# Sxx Plan: <study / derivation target>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Goal
Produce a concrete derivation/computation/check as a promotion candidate (no manuscript edits).

## Deliverable (keep bounded)
- Target: <1–2 pages of derivation OR one toy computation OR one symbolic check>
- Output file(s):
  - `blackboards/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` and/or `paper/notes/<topic>.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/Sxx-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- A self-contained derivation/check with enough detail to be promoted by a later `C` cycle.
- Any commands run are recorded (command + output summary).
