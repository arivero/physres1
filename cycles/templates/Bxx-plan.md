# Bxx Plan: <bibliography target>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Goal
Acquire/verify independent sources for specific claims (no manuscript edits).

## Target citation keys
- `<Key1>`: <what claim it anchors>
- `<Key2>`: <what claim it anchors>

## OA-first triage order
1. arXiv
2. INSPIRE
3. KEK / other legal mirrors
4. Publisher OA
5. Otherwise mark `PENDING` with next action

## Allowed files
- `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`
- `sources/pending-*.md`
- `cycles/Bxx-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/` (spawn an `S` if a reproduction is needed)

## Acceptance criteria
- Ledger updated with correct metadata and acquisition status.
- Sources ingested (or `PENDING` stubs created) with enough detail for later promotion.
