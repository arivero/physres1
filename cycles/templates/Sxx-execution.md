# Sxx Execution: <study / derivation target>

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Work performed
- <what was derived / checked>

## Artifacts produced
- `blackboards/<0-6>.md`: <slot used>
- `notebooks/...`: <path, if promoted>

## Commands run (if any)
```bash
<command>
```

## Result
- <what is now stable enough to promote?>

## Promotion candidate (pointer)
- Location: <blackboard section header and/or notebook entry>
- (Optional) Short copyable block: <keep brief; long derivations live in blackboards/notebooks>

## Discovery flag (fill at end of cycle)
- Did this computation reveal something unexpected? **yes / no**
- If yes: <one sentence stating what>
- If yes: add an entry to `docs/anomalies.md` for triage in the next D-explore cycle.

## Spawned cycles
- `Cxx`: (when ready) promote the candidate into <target manuscript>
- `Bxx` (optional): anchor <load-bearing claim>
