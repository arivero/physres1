# B09 Red Team: Bibliography Risks (Theme L)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Failure modes
- Anchor does not explicitly mention sources are Grassmann:
  - Mitigation: switch to a different OA note that states the generating functional with \(\eta,\bar\eta\) explicitly.
- OA fetch fails (network blocks):
  - Mitigation: create `sources/pending-...` with attempted URLs and proceed with carefully scoped prose.
- Over-reliance on Rivero references for validation:
  - Mitigation: reuse independent point-interaction sources already present (`[Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials]`, `[BonneauFarautValent2001SAE]`) and keep Rivero items attribution-only.
