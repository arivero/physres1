# C19 Debate

## Question
Is “fixed point → quantization rule” a real structural point or just a finite-volume artifact?

## Notes
- In 1D, scale-invariant boundary conditions (Dirichlet/Neumann and relatives) give universal \(k_n\sim n\pi/L\) type spectra.
- With a point defect/contact term, the quantization condition becomes a phase-shift equation \(2kL+\delta(k)=2\pi n\); fixed points correspond to \(\delta(k)\) constant (or with a definite scaling form).
