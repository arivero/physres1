# S133 Debate: Wigner function and sub-Planck structure

Date: 2026-02-13

## Pro
- Completes the phase-space portrait sequence: Husimi (coarse) → Wigner (fine)
- Connects to Remark 6.4's non-negativity statement by explaining its origin
- Sub-Planck structure is a well-established concept in quantum optics

## Con
- "Sub-Planck" terminology could confuse readers thinking of Planck length
  → Mitigated: use "finer than the minimal uncertainty cell" in manuscript
- Wigner function is not central to the action-angle indeterminacy argument
  → But it deepens the phase-space picture already started by Remarks 6.4–6.5

## Resolution
Promote as a compact remark (~3 sentences), avoid "sub-Planck" jargon in the
manuscript text, and frame as complement to Husimi discussion.
