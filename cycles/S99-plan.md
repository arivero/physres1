# S99 Plan: Cornerstone cross-reference to Dirac Probes satellite
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Assess whether the cornerstone Section 5 should cross-reference the new Dirac Probes satellite.
Currently the cornerstone has 3 satellite cross-references:
- HD-D1.3 (Section 6.3)
- RG-D1.2a (Section 10.5)
- RG-D1.7 (Section 8.4)

## Assessment
Section 5 of the cornerstone (P3.1-P3.4) is the natural anchor. The satellite provides:
- Theorem 2.1 (explicit hypotheses for mollifier localization)
- Worked delta-kick model
- N-impulse → path integral bridge
- Safe-vs-unsafe taxonomy

A parenthetical cross-reference after P3.2 or after the Section 5.6 caveats would point interested readers to the expanded treatment.

## Approach
Add one parenthetical cross-reference in Section 5, following the established pattern.
