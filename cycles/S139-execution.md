# S139 Execution: Real spherical harmonics

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work Done
- Wrote blackboard slot 0: Real spherical harmonics as minimal m-superposition. Equal-weight Y_{l,m}+Y_{l,-m} gives cos(mφ)/sin(mφ) lobes with Var(Lz)=m²ℏ².
- Atomic physics pedagogue reviewed: phase convention error in explicit formulas ((-1)^m placement), but Var(Lz)=m²ℏ² CORRECT, chemistry connection CORRECT, Section 3 fit EXCELLENT.
- Fix: promoted remark uses "real and imaginary parts" phrasing, avoiding explicit formulas to sidestep phase convention issue.
