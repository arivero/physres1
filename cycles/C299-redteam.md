## Failure modes
1. Readers treat \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\) as a global theorem beyond stated asymptotics.
2. The new remark distracts from the section's primary areal-law point.

## Mitigations
1. Keep explicit assumptions in the remark (fixed \(L\), small-\(r\), power-law attraction).
2. Keep the paragraph short and companion-oriented.
