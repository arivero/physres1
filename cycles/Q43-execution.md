# Q43 Execution: Referee Pass on the New \(\hbar\) Witness (`Derivation D4.2a`)

## Checks Run
- Reviewed `paper/main.md` Section 6.4 around `Derivation D4.2a` for:
  - stationary vs minimum consistency,
  - Euclidean vs real-time wording,
  - risk of overclaiming rigor.

## Findings
- One phrase risked implying a specifically "Newtonian" minimization rule; classical mechanics is stationary, and the Euclidean witness is a controlled but distinct signature choice.

## Edits Made
- Adjusted wording in `paper/main.md` `Derivation D4.2a` to avoid conflating Newtonian stationarity with Euclidean minimization.

## Next Spawn
- `C85` (optional): extend "constants as controls" with one similarly nonstandard witness for \(c\) or \(G\).
