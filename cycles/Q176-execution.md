# Q176 Execution: Referee pass on C293 quantitative Package A bounds

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C293`

## Findings
- PASS.
- `Proposition P12.2` is correctly scoped as a bounded-potential semigroup-norm estimate (sufficient bounds, not optimal constants).
- Remainder/control structure is coherent with the first-order Duhamel framing of `D12.2`.
- Composition-defect estimate is appropriately conservative and presented as witness-level control.
- Package A status line now matches delivered content.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- `C294` (optional): sharpen constants or add an explicit solvable nontrivial potential kernel to complement norm-level bounds.

## Notes (non-actions)
- Current main-book state is technically much less scaffold-dominated: each recent C-cycle introduced new derivation/proposition content.
