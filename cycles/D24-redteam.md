# D24 Red Team: Delta-Object Dictionary

Date: 2026-02-14

## Failure modes
- Conflating \(\delta(f')\) with \(\delta'\) in prose or notation.
- Treating “delta-functional on paths” as a literal measure rather than a regulated asymptotic.
- Overpromising rigor where only heuristic stationary-phase intuition is available.

## Mitigations
- Maintain a strict notational dictionary: \(\delta(f')\) (delta of a function) vs \(\delta'\) (distribution derivative).
- Require each path-space slogan to be accompanied by one finite-dimensional or kernel-level regulated witness.
- Keep the “safe vs unsafe” criterion explicit (continuity/mollifier universality vs diagonal singularity/products).
