# C37 Red Team

## Failure Modes
1. The micro-edit introduces new technical claims without a worked example.
2. The draft grows and loses its “synthesis note” character.

## Mitigations
- Keep changes to one sentence (plus an optional pointer).
- Any worked corner/jump computation goes into a study blackboard note (`S` cycle) first.
