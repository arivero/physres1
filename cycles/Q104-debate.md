# Q104 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Decision
The cold referee review was thorough (read full 1486-line manuscript) and found one genuine clarification needed (H0.2 operator vs propagator ambiguity). The fix is minimal (adding "as operators"). Two IMPORTANT issues were noted: one is a false positive (Section 10.2 does treat the general f(q)p family), and one (D5.1b derivation gap) is deferred as a citation addition rather than a content rewrite.
