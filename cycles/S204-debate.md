# S204 — Debate

## Hard question
Is V(p) = (1/6)R a genuine "D=4 selection mechanism" or merely a
numerical coincidence between two independent constants?

## Current resolution
The result is a *matching condition*: the half-density conjugation
potential (1/6)R and the conformal coupling ξ_conf R coincide only at
D=4. This is mathematically rigorous.

Whether this constitutes a "selection" depends on whether one can argue
that conformal coupling is *forced* (e.g., by scale invariance at a fixed
point, or by the structure of the conformal anomaly). If conformal coupling
is independently motivated, then the matching at D=4 is physically
significant: it means the half-density field equation becomes "curvature-free
at leading order" only in D=4.

The strongest version of the claim would be:
"If physics requires both (a) half-density normalization (for canonical
kernel composition) and (b) conformal invariance at the UV fixed point,
then D=4 is the unique dimension where these are compatible at leading
curvature order."

This is a conditional statement, not an unconditional dimension selection.
The paper should present it as such.
