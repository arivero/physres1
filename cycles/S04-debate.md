# S04 Debate

## Question
Do we need to fully pin the scattering-amplitude normalization (relation between \(T\) and physical \(f(k)\)) inside the RG note, or is it enough to keep \(T\) as an internal algebraic object and state “up to conventions” honestly?

## Working Resolution
For the “RG is compatibility” thesis, the load-bearing content is the **beta function** and **RG-invariant scale**, which are convention robust. Keep \(T\)-normalization caveats explicit and (if needed) add a short mapping to physical scattering in a later content cycle.
