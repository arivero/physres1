# C184 Debate: Ehrenfest time Remark 7.3

Date: 2026-02-13

## Decisions
- Placed in Section 7 as Remark 7.3 — temporal complement to Remarks 7.1 (phase-space) and 7.2 (spectral).
- Cross-referenced Remark 5.1 (quantum revivals) for the integrable dispersal timescale.
- No corrections needed from reviewer.
