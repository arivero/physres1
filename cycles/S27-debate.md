# S27 Debate: Is the \(2L_P\) Saturation Physically Meaningful?

## Question
Does the \(r\to 2L_P\) saturation (for \(\dot A_0=cL_P\), inverse-square, mechanical SR) reflect real physics or just a model artifact?

## Current Resolution
Treat it as a structural witness, not as a universal prediction:
- It is robust inside the chosen model assumptions (external inverse-square force + fixed coordinate-time areal speed).
- It should not be read as a GR/QFT theorem.
- As a research signal, it is still useful: SR correction does not destroy the Planck-area witness; it regularizes it into a bounded interpolation.
