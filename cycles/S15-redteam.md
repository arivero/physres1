# S15 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. **Oversell:** implying real physical renormalization is “nothing but derivatives”.
2. **Conflate deltas:** mixing up \(\delta'\) with \(\delta(f')\) or with “stationary-set” deltas.
3. **Sign errors:** the \(\delta'\) pairing sign is easy to flip.
4. **Too abstract:** readers don’t see the connection to point-splitting/contact terms.

## Mitigations
1. Label the derivative example explicitly as a **toy structural analogy**, not an identification.
2. Include a short explicit dictionary: evaluation functional \(\leftrightarrow \delta\); derivative-at-zero functional \(\leftrightarrow -\delta'\); stationary-set localization \(\leftrightarrow \delta(f')\) (different object).
3. Write at least one fully worked pairing calculation with a test function \(\varphi\) to fix signs.
4. Add one paragraph linking the pattern to point-splitting renormalization of composite operators and to contact terms in Green’s functions.
