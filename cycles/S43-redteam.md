# S43 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **False theorem framing:** "QM is forced" stated as rigorous inevitability.
2. **Overtechnical detour:** measure-theory details swamp the introduction.
3. **Conflation:** mixing ordering ambiguity, renormalization, and singular probes into one claim.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the manuscript insertion explicitly heuristic and motivational.
2. Keep the list short and pointer-like; details stay in blackboards and later sections.
3. Present items as distinct failure modes with distinct control mechanisms.
