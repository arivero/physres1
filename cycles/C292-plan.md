# C292 Plan: Package A deepening beyond free Gaussian witness

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Extend Package A from free regulated-kernel composition to a nontrivial potential/regulator witness with explicit closure and failure conditions.

## Target manuscripts
- `paper/main.md` (yes)
- `papers/<name>/main.md` (no)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add first-order potential-perturbed composition derivation in Appendix 10.6 (Duhamel-level witness).
- Add explicit failure mode for singular/unbounded negative potentials.
- Update Section 9.5 Package A status line.

Out of scope:
- Full constructive path-space measure theory.
- Full Kato-class theorem proofs.
- New bibliography ingestion.

## Acceptance criteria
- At least one new numbered derivation in Appendix 10.6 beyond free Gaussian case.
- Failure mode stated explicitly and tied to assumptions.
- Diffstat recorded in `cycles/C292-execution.md`.
- Guard checks pass.
