# S186 Redteam: Dipole Selection Rules Blackboard

## Coverage
Atomic physicist persona reviewed blackboard cold, identified 8 issues across rigor/pedagogy/correctness tiers.

## All HIGH and MEDIUM Issues Resolved
- Δl = ±1 rule now derivation-complete with polar integral orthogonality.
- Photon angular momentum sign/mode conventions corrected (π ↔ q=0, σ± ↔ q=±1).

## Residual LOW Issues
5 LOW items (notation, example depth, cross-ref anchors) are stylistic and do not block promotion. Addressed via minor edits.

## Physics Soundness
No unresolved technical errors. Blackboard is accurate and ready for Remark 3.2 insertion.

## Next Step
Proceed to C227 (Remark 3.2 promotion).
