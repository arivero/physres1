# C68 Debate: Does "Zeno-Style Paradox" Help or Distract?

## Question
Does adding a Zeno-style framing improve the paper, or risk sounding philosophical rather than technical?

## Current Resolution
Keep it as one short paragraph tied directly to concrete issues already treated in the manuscript:
- singular probes (delta/mollifiers),
- divergent refinement limits (renormalization),
- non-uniqueness/scheme dependence (control maps).
