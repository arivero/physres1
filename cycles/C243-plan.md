# C243 — Plan

## Goal
Promote S203 (self-adjoint extensions blackboard) into delta-objects paper
as Remark 4.2, after Example 4.1.

## Scope
- Insert Remark 4.2 with corrected content (H^2 not H^1, resolvent
  exponent d-2, Laplace transform note).
- Add Derezinski 2024 reference.
- Target: stay within 6pp PLB limit.

## Acceptance
- Diffstat +N/-0 with N >= 5.
- Compiled page count <= 6pp.
- No cycle-tag leaks.
