# C119 Red Team: planck-area standalone cleanup

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes

### 1. Three-level hierarchy (PA-E5a) now lacks external anchors
- Risk: removed "Proposition P6.2" and "D6.2a-sg" references leave the semigroup level without a citation
- Mitigation: the claim is stated with an inline example ("any toy ODE with a linear beta"). Self-contained.

### 2. "Broader program" language is vague
- Risk: Section 6 now says "the broader program" without identifying it
- Mitigation: acceptable for a preprint. The abstract and body provide sufficient context. A formal citation can be added when the main paper is published.
