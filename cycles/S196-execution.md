# S196: Execution — Dedekind cuts vs Cauchy sequences
**Date:** 2026-02-13
Wrote blackboard 0.md: Dedekind cuts (order-theoretic) vs Cauchy sequences (metric). Different "control data" yielding the same limit object. Reviewed by rigorous mathematician: HIGH — fix Dedekind cut definition (non-emptiness, no-max); MEDIUM — clarify uniqueness from completeness; MEDIUM — reframe duality connection (3.8 stronger than 4.8); LOW — generalization nuance (Dedekind gives complete lattices, not fields). All corrections applied in C237.
