# C315 Plan: Initial Rooted-Tree Bookkeeping Paper Draft

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Draft initial structure for "Rooted Trees as Bookkeeping (Butcher ↔ RG)" satellite paper

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md` (new file)

## Scope
In scope:
- Section 1: Introduction (motivate dictionary, scope statement)
- Section 2: Rooted trees and B-series (Butcher foundation)
- Section 3: Worked RK example (midpoint method from S297 blackboard)
- Section 4: RG counterterm recursion (1-loop template, can expand later)
- Section 5: Dictionary table + structural comparison
- Section 6: Outlook
- YAML metadata, abstract, references section

Out of scope:
- 2-loop RG computation (defer to later C-cycle if needed)
- Full Hopf algebra formalism (outlook only)
- Heavy bibliography work (spawn B34 when needed)

## Minimum promotion bar
Create complete paper structure (~200-300 lines initial draft, 6-9pp target)
Include all 6 sections with at least paragraph-level content

## Allowed files
- `papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md` (new)
- `cycles/C315-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Blackboards (source: slot 0, do not modify during C-cycle)
- `paper/bibliography.md` (defer to B-cycle)

## Acceptance criteria
- Paper directory created
- main.md has complete structure (all sections)
- Diffstat recorded
- No cycle IDs in manuscript
