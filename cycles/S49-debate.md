# S49 Debate: Which Ordering Example Fits Best?

## Question
Should the manuscript use an \(H=pq\) toy model, or a more "physical" kinetic term with position-dependent mass / curved metric where ordering affects curvature terms?

## Current Resolution
Use \(H=pq\) as the minimal, transparent example (one page, no geometry), and keep the curved-space ordering story for a dependent follow-up draft if needed.
