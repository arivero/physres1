# S10 Debate

## Question
Does “half-densities in QFT” mean (i) densitized fields/propagators on spacetime, (ii) half-densities on *field space* (BV), or both?

## Working Resolution
Do both but keep them separated:
1. spacetime half-densities are concrete and computable (propagator kernels, curved backgrounds),
2. BV half-densities are a structural theme (integration on field space) that may require a later bibliography cycle for authoritative anchors.
