# D41 Plan: Rooted-Tree Bookkeeping Paper Scoping

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
What is the minimal technical content for a standalone "Rooted Trees as Bookkeeping" paper that makes the Butcher ↔ RG dictionary explicit?

## Context
- Cornerstone mentions Butcher group/trees as structural analogy to RG (Section 8)
- `docs/next-articles.md` item D lists deliverables: dictionary, one computation per side, analogy vs literal equivalence
- No existing draft in papers/

## Success criteria (mathematics in blackboard/notebook)
**Scope map** (not full computation):
1. Identify 3-5 key dictionary entries (B-series ↔ counterterm expansion, tree composition ↔ subtraction recursion, etc.)
2. Pick one explicit computation per side (RK step-doubling coefficient OR simple 1-loop counterterm)
3. State where semigroup (RG) vs group (Butcher) structure matters

**Output:** Blackboard note with scope map + one worked toy example (e.g., tree composition for order-2 RK method)

## Expected outcome
- D41 produces scope map → spawn S297 for toy computation → spawn C315 for initial draft
- Target length: PRD-style (9-13pp compiled)

## Permitted tools
- Blackboards (slot TBD, check availability)
- Notebooks if computation stabilizes
- Literature search if specific Butcher/Hopf refs needed (spawn B cycle)

## Out of scope (this cycle)
- Full paper draft (that's C315 after S297)
- Heavy bibliography (defer to B cycle if needed)
