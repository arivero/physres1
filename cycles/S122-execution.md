## Blackboard
Created `blackboards/2026-02-13-uehling-potential.md`: Uehling potential as concrete coordinate-space face of vacuum polarization. Studied the vacuum polarization integral Π(Q²), the Uehling potential integral, short/long-distance limits, and Lamb shift connection.

## Review
Subagent (QED specialist): all claims correct except missing factor of 2 in Π(Q²) integrand (blackboard-only, does not affect satellite promotion). Uehling integral, limits, and Lamb shift connection all verified.

## Promotion → C163
Example 3.2 in fermionic mediators satellite after Section 3.1.
