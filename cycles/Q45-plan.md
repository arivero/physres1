# Q45 Plan: Referee Pass on `C87` (Fermionic Mediators / Contact Limits Note)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C87`

## Goal
Referee-pass the new dependent note introduced in `C87` for:
- claim hygiene (no overclaiming about “fermions cannot mediate forces”),
- clarity of the Grassmann-source obstruction statement,
- correctness of the contact matching derivation,
- citation sufficiency for the key formal point.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q45-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Concrete findings and (if needed) spawned follow-up cycles expressed as `D/S/B/C` (not direct edits).
