# S297 Plan: Rooted-Tree Scope Map + Toy Butcher Example

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent: D41

## Goal
Produce scope map for rooted-trees paper + one worked Butcher example to anchor the dictionary.

## Success criteria (mathematics in blackboard)
**Deliverable 1: Dictionary scope map (5-7 entries)**
- B-series / composition ↔ counterterm expansion / subtraction
- Rooted-tree Hopf algebra ↔ RG algebraic structure
- Tree grafting ↔ nested subdivergences
- Order condition ↔ renormalization condition
- Semigroup vs group (where they differ)

**Deliverable 2: One worked Butcher example**
- Order-2 Runge-Kutta (midpoint or Heun)
- Show tree composition for step-doubling: K_{2h} vs K_h ∘ K_h
- Extract one coefficient identity explicitly

**Output location:** Blackboard slot 0 (now available after C314 promotion)

## References to check (quick scan, not full bibliography)
- Butcher 2016 (Numerical Methods for ODEs) — standard reference
- Hairer/Lubich/Wanner — geometric integration
- Connes/Kreimer RG Hopf algebra papers (if needed)

## Out of scope
- Full RG counterterm computation (defer to later S-cycle if paper needs it)
- Formal Hopf algebra proofs (keep computational)
