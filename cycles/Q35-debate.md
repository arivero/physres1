# Q35 Debate: Keep "Uncuttable" Term or Rename?

## Question
Should the dependent note keep the word "uncuttable", or rename it to "controlled refinement" entirely?

## Current Resolution
Keep "uncuttable" in the title but define it immediately and use "controlled refinement" as the primary technical phrase inside the note.
