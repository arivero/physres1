# D05 Red Team: Risks in a “Docs + Referee Pass” Next Step

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Docs drift and lose the true state:
  - Mitigation: log completions immediately after each cycle chain; keep “Next Cycle Target” current.
- Referee pass becomes vague:
  - Mitigation: focus `Q49` on concrete actionable follow-ups (spawn `C/S/B` cycles with crisp scopes).
