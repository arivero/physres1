## Remaining Vulnerabilities
1. The “RG is definitional” framing needs at least one explicit, nontrivial beta-function computation to avoid sounding purely philosophical.
2. The calculus counterterm analogy is persuasive but must not be mistaken for capturing the full complexity of QFT renormalization.
3. The semigroup vs group distinction (information loss under coarse-graining) should be made crisp in the follow-up.

## Evidence Needed
1. Add one explicit model computation with scheme dependence called out (follow-up `C14`).
2. Add a short section clarifying when refinement/composition is invertible vs not.
