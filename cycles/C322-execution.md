# C322 Execution: RG-Fundamental Conclusion Expansion

Date: 2026-02-14

## What was expanded
Section 7 (Conclusion) of `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` (692 → 721 lines, +29)

## Content added
**Three new remarks in conclusion:**

**RG-H1.15: RG as one channel in multi-channel compatibility** (~15 lines)
- RCP operational form: O_{h,θ} = O_{h',τ(θ)} ∘ T
- Three channels: partition (temporal), representation (ordering), scale (RG)
- Forward references to [RCPFoundations] and [RootedTreeBookkeeping]

**RG-H1.16: Three crown witnesses for RCP** (~10 lines)
- Partition: Noether's theorem (conserved charge)
- Representation: Ordering ambiguity (O(ℏ) shift)
- Scale: 2D delta dimensional transmutation (κ_*)
- Identifies 2D delta as scale-channel crown witness

**RG-H1.17: Foundational reading (RG is definitional)** (~15 lines)
- RG as structural requirement, not calculational technique
- Parallel to derivative (regulated limit + subtraction + normalization)
- Reframes counterterm methods as computational implementations
- Outlook: QFT fixed points, Butcher/RG dictionary, gravity extension

**References added:**
- [RootedTreeBookkeeping] (ref 9)
- [RCPFoundations] (ref 10)

## Diffstat
```
papers/rg-fundamental/main.md: +29 -0 (692 → 721 lines)
TOTAL: +29 -0
```

## Combined impact (C321+C322)
- Initial: 601 lines (~10pp)
- Final: 721 lines (~12pp)
- Total expansion: +120 lines
- Section 4 (Rooted Trees): 30 → 120 lines (4x expansion)
- Section 7 (Conclusion): 12 → 55 lines (4.5x expansion)
- RG-fundamental now matches PRD satellite page range (12-13pp)

## Guard checks
- ✓ No cycle IDs
- ✓ All forward references valid (to existing satellite papers)
- ✓ Multi-channel RCP framework introduced (ties to RCP-foundations paper)
- ✓ Crown witnesses identified (partition/representation/scale)
