# C291 Plan: Package B curved-manifold closure extension

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Extend Package B from the periodic `S^1` starter to a curved-manifold kinetic-operator benchmark with explicit domain/symmetry boundaries.

## Target manuscripts
- `paper/main.md` (yes)
- `papers/<name>/main.md` (no)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add a curved-manifold kinetic benchmark in Appendix 10.2 using half-density conjugation as a symmetry-preserving map.
- Add a direct contrast with naive left-order kinetic operator and explicit non-symmetry condition.
- Update Section 9.5 Package B status accordingly.

Out of scope:
- Full self-adjoint extension classification.
- New bibliography acquisition.
- Companion-paper edits.

## Acceptance criteria
- At least one new numbered derivation in Appendix 10.2 that is curved-manifold specific.
- Explicit domain/scope boundary retained.
- Diffstat recorded in `cycles/C291-execution.md`.
- Guard checks pass.
