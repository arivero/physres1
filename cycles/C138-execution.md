# C138 Execution: Add Van Vleck determinant section to delta-objects paper
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
1. New Section 3.5 (Van Vleck determinant: the propagator instance of the square-root Hessian):
   - Semiclassical propagator formula with √D prefactor.
   - Van Vleck determinant defined as mixed Hessian |det(-∂²S_cl/∂q_f∂q_i)|.
   - Noted difference (mixed vs full Hessian) while showing same stationary-phase origin.
   - Example 3.5a: free particle D = (m/Δt)^d → √D = (m/Δt)^{d/2}, recovering Section 2's normalization.
2. Updated Outlook: item 1 marked as addressed; added item 3 (Lorentzian extension).
3. Added reference 5: [VanVleck1928Correspondence].

Paper: 138 → 164 lines (+26 net).
