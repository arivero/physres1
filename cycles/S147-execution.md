# S147 Execution: Lattice gauge theory as refinement limit

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 0 on Wilson's lattice gauge theory: plaquette action S_W = β Σ_P Re Tr(1 - U_P), exact gauge invariance, asymptotic freedom with β₀ = (11N-2N_f)/3, continuum limit as a→0, confinement/area law.
2. Reviewer (lattice QCD practitioner) found:
   - All physics correct EXCEPT compact U(1) phase transition: stated "first-order" but it is second-order in 4D. Fixed by not including U(1) contrast in promoted remark.
   - Clay Prize clarification: formally about mass gap, not just area law. Incorporated into promoted remark.
3. Promoted as Remark 4.3 in uncuttable Section 4 (after Remark 4.2 on dim reg).
