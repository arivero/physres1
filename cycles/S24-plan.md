# S24 Plan: Special-Relativistic Central-Force Circular Orbits (Inverse-Square Special Case)

## Goal
Re-derive, from scratch and without transcript dependence, the SR circular-orbit conditions under a power-law central force \(F=K/r^q\), with emphasis on the inverse-square (\(q=2\)) simplification and the resulting angular-momentum bound.

## Scope
- Produce one blackboard note containing:
  1. SR circular-motion force balance \(F=\gamma m v^2/r\) (perpendicular acceleration case),
  2. relation between \(v,r\) and angular momentum \(L=\gamma m r v\),
  3. derived circular-orbit condition in terms of \(L\) and \(K\),
  4. special case \(q=2\): \(v=K/L\) and the bound \(L>K/c\).
- Keep to existence/admissibility of circular orbits; defer stability and noncircular-orbit classification.

## Acceptance Tests
1. The note includes the boxed identity \(v=K/L\) for \(q=2\) and the bound \(L>K/c\).
2. The Newtonian limit \(c\to\infty\) is shown explicitly for the radius formula.
3. The derivation uses consistent SR force/acceleration relations (perpendicular case).
