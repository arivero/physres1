## Work Done
- Added Remark 4.3 after Remark 4.2, before Section 5.
- Huang-Yang pseudopotential V=(4πℏ²a/m)δ³(r)(∂/∂r)(r·) — regularization built into operator.
- Corrected prefactor from 2π to 4π per reviewer feedback.
- Connected to Example 5.2 SAE framework and scattering-length boundary condition.
- fermionic mediators: 144 → 147 lines (7 pages).
