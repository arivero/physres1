# Q53 Red Team: What a referee would attack in C96

Date: 2026-02-11

## Likely referee objections
- “You claim a symbolic check, but the check is not shown.”
  - Mitigation: either inline a short derivation sketch or cite a standard reference for the conformal Laplacian conjugation identity; keep the SymPy check as internal verification.
- “Cross-references to companion notes are not accessible.”
  - Mitigation: treat cross-references as optional; for a standalone submission, replace with citations or self-contained derivations.
