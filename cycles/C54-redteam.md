# C54 Redteam: Failure Modes for Promotion

## Failure Modes
1. **Scope overreach:** reading the \(2L_P\) saturation as a universal quantum-gravity prediction.
2. **Notation drift:** changing areal-speed conventions mid-derivation (\(dA/dt\) vs \(dA/d\tau\)).
3. **Thread confusion:** mixing the inverse-square SR continuation with generic-\(q\) claims that are only bound-level.

## Mitigations
1. Add explicit scope caveat in the promoted text.
2. Fix the derivation to coordinate-time areal speed \(\dot A_0=dA/dt\).
3. Keep the promoted statement inverse-square only; leave generic-\(q\) as a separate remark/bound.
