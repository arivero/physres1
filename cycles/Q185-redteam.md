## Failure Modes

### 1. Reviewer unfamiliar with von Roos ordering finds P5.2a unclear
**Risk:** The remark assumes familiarity with position-dependent mass physics.
**Mitigation:** The remark references D9.1a for details. The key claim (Layer 1+2 agreement, Layer 3 scalar difference) is self-contained.

### 2. Overconfidence in "PASS" verdict
**Risk:** Missing a subtle error in the energy-shift formula.
**Mitigation:** The formula was verified against two independent sources: blackboard 6 (S294, direct calculation) and notebook deformation-equivalence-physical.md (consolidated version). Both give the same result.
