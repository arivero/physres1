# S78 Debate: Is the "geometric vs dynamical" separation robust beyond Dirac-supported interactions?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The clean factorization (Van Vleck = geometric half-density, T-matrix = scalar amplitude containing κ*) works because the interaction is Dirac-supported at a single point. For non-pointlike interactions, the "vertex factor" would be a kernel (not a scalar), and the factorization might be more complex. Is the structural separation an artifact of the contact-interaction simplification?

## Recommendation
The separation is genuine for the 2D delta witness and correctly identifies two distinct roles. For extended interactions, the T-matrix becomes a kernel T(x,y;E) that itself carries half-density weight in both variables, so the factorization is more intricate but the *types* of the factors (half-density at endpoints, scalar/half-density at vertices) still follow from the bi-half-density structure of the resolvent. The essential point — that the transmutation scale enters the *amplitude* of the vertex factor, not the *transformation law* — persists because the RG equation is a statement about the scalar coefficient, not about how the kernel transforms under diffeomorphisms. No change to the blackboard conclusion needed; a future S cycle could verify this for a non-contact model if desired.
