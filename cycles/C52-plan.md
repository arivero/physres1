# C52 Plan: Promote Schwarzschild Baseline into `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`

## Goal
Turn the S25 blackboard derivation into the next content wave of the relativistic-central-orbits draft:
- add Schwarzschild metric + conserved \(E,L\),
- write the radial equation as an effective potential,
- derive the photon sphere \(r_{\mathrm{ph}}=3M\),
- cite the OA baseline anchor `[Carroll1997LectureGR]`.

## Scope
- Edit `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md`:
  - add a GR baseline section and move “next waves” down.
- Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
1. The draft contains a short GR section with the effective potential and photon-sphere derivation statement.
2. The GR section cites `[Carroll1997LectureGR]` as baseline anchor.
3. Cycle recorded and committed.
