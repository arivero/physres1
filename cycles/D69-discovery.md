# D69 Discovery: Anomaly cancellation through the composition lens

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent: D57 (failure taxonomy), D58 (Atiyah-Segal functoriality), S210

## Novelty target
Does the composition framework say anything non-trivial about anomaly
CANCELLATION (beyond what D57/S210 already established)?

## Analysis

### 1. Anomalies as composition obstruction — KNOWN RESTATEMENT
D57 already classified anomalies as "symmetry-composition conflicts." The
Fujikawa measure Jacobian is literally the composition integral's phase
mismatch. S210 concluded: "conceptual reframing YES, new constraints NO."
Half-density formulation (HD-D4.2a) makes the trace anomaly and index theorem
manifestly coordinate-free, but this is organizational, not computational.

### 2. Cancellation as composition restoration — CONSISTENT, NOT THEOREM
One might hope: A1 requires gauge invariance of the sewing integral, so anomaly
cancellation is necessary for composition. TRUE — but this is exactly the
standard statement (Ward identity preservation). The composition framework does
not add a selection principle: it cannot predict WHICH fermion representations
cancel the anomaly. A1 is structural (kernels compose), not content-selective
(doesn't specify field content or gauge group). The cancellation conditions
Tr[T^a {T^b, T^c}] = 0 are representation-theoretic, not compositional.

### 3. Connection to D59 (fermionic composition) — SPECULATIVE
D59's algebraic/geometric split suggests anomalies live in the geometric sector
(measure, d/2, integration domain) not the algebraic sector (exp(iS/ℏ), κ=ℏ).
This is consistent: anomalies arise from the measure (geometric) not from the
action exponential (algebraic). But this observation doesn't produce new constraints.

### 4. Index theorem connection — CONSISTENT
The Atiyah-Singer index is additive under composition (McKean-Singer supertrace),
which fits the functorial picture (D58). But the index theorem is already
well-established; the composition viewpoint provides a home for it within the
taxonomy but doesn't extend it.

## Verdict
**MINOR (organizational restatement).** D57/S210 already covered the key
observation (anomalies = composition-symmetry conflict). The new question
(does composition constrain cancellation?) has a clean but negative answer:
composition requires cancellation but cannot select the specific representation
content that achieves it. This is because A1 constrains structure, not content
(the D61 separation). Anomaly cancellation is a content condition.

### Promotability
Not promotable beyond existing D57 material. The "structure vs content"
connection to D61 is a nice observation but already implicit in the current
manuscript text (P9.1's structure/content separation).

## Spawned cycles
None.
