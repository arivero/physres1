# D15 Debate: Should D cycles edit past C-cycle logs?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
The strict file-permissions model says D cycles can only edit `cycles/Dxx-*.md` and docs files. But D15's purpose is to backfill `cycles/C100-execution.md`. Is this a permitted exception?

## Current position
Yes, as a metadata-only backfill. The edit adds no new prose or claims — it fills in audit metadata (diffstat, guard-check results) that the original C100 cycle should have recorded. This is housekeeping, not a substantive change.

## What would change my mind?
- If the backfill required changing the C100 summary, work log, or spawned-cycles sections (i.e. rewriting history), it would be inappropriate.
- The edit is limited to the Diffstat and Guard Checks sections, which are mechanical/audit fields.
