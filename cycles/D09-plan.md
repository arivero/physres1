# D09 Plan: Post-promotion housekeeping (cycle board + log) and next-action selection

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Update the durable planning artifacts after the `C97 → Q54` chain and choose the next bounded action.

## Novelty candidates (shortlist)
1. Time-capped bibliography hardening (`B12`) for `[Dirac1933]` if OA access is possible.
2. Micro-follow-up promotion (`C98`) only if additional clarity is genuinely needed (avoid turning one-sentence edits into standalone `C` cycles).

## Decision criteria
- Keep the cycle board and research log consistent with the actual repo state.
- Prefer the smallest next step that reduces future ambiguity or debt.

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/D09-*.md`
- `cycles/index.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Expected spawns
- None required (this is mainly planning/logging); optionally queue `B12` or `C98` in `cycles/index.md`.

## Acceptance criteria
- Cycle board updated to include `C97` and `Q54`.
- Research log includes dated entries for `C97` and `Q54`.
- A clear “next action” list is set.
