# Q175 Debate: Is D12.2 too weak to count as closure progress?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does first-order closure in \(V\) meaningfully advance Package A, or is it still planning text?

## Recommendation
It meaningfully advances Package A because it upgrades from free Gaussian composition to nontrivial potential data with explicit closure/error order and failure conditions.
