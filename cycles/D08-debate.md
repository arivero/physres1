# D08 Debate: What counts as “novelty” here?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Is the \(D(4-D)\) cancellation in the conformal expansion a meaningful structural signal, or merely an algebraic artifact of a particular conjugation choice and metric ansatz?

## Current position
Treat it as an **explicit checkable witness** and a reader-friendly simplification, not as an interpretive thesis. Any stronger interpretation requires separate independent evidence.

## What would change my mind?
- If the cancellation disappears under a coordinate-invariant re-derivation (i.e. it was a coordinate error).
- If the cancellation is shown to be a trivial restatement of a standard identity that adds no conceptual clarity in this context.
