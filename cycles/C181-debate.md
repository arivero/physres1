# C181 Debate: Pseudopotential Remark 4.3

Date: 2026-02-13

## Decisions
- Placed after Remark 4.2, before Section 5 (SAE framework) — natural bridge to self-adjoint extension discussion.
- Used 4πℏ²a/m (standard Huang-Yang convention, corrected from initial 2π).
- Described the (∂/∂r)(r·) mechanism explicitly: extracts regular part, avoids explicit cutoff.
- Characterized as "smart contact kernel" to connect with paper's contact-limit theme.
