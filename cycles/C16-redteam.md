## Failure Modes to Watch
1. Smuggling in a background density (metric) while claiming “background-free”.
2. Confusing “half-density is natural for convolution” (true) with “half-densities force Planck area” (conditional).
3. Letting the scale be reintroduced by a coupling redefinition (making H2.5 vacuous).
4. Turning the main manuscript into an over-technical half-density treatise.
