# S186 Plan: Dipole Selection Rules Blackboard (Action-Angle Paper §3)

## Objective
Write blackboard note on dipole selection rules (Δm, Δl) as Fourier orthogonality for Section 3 of action-angle paper.

## Scope
- Azimuthal Fourier integral → Δm selection rule derivation
- Polar/Clebsch-Gordan structure for Δl = ±1
- Connection to photon angular momentum (qℏ)
- Zeeman demonstration as example
- Explicit link to Section 4 Fourier tradeoff theme

## Methods
1. Derive Δm from azimuthal integral orthogonality
2. Cite standard angular momentum coupling (Clebsch-Gordan, dipole operator structure)
3. Clarify photon quantum number q (not zero for linear/circular modes)
4. Launch atomic physicist reviewer for subagent QA pass

## Expected Output
Blackboard 0 ready for promotion to Remark 3.2.
