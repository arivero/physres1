# S190 Plan: Zeno's paradoxes blackboard for uncuttable paper

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study Zeno's paradoxes as proto-refinement limits for uncuttable paper Section 1.

## Deliverable (keep bounded)
- Target: one blackboard entry (~1 page) mapping dichotomy, Achilles, and arrow paradoxes to modern refinement-limit framing
- Output file:
  - `blackboards/zeno-paradoxes-proto-refinement.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S190-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Self-contained blackboard with dichotomy, Achilles, and arrow paradoxes mapped to refinement logic.
- Enough detail and nuance (hedging around anachronism) to be promoted into a Remark.
- Reviewed by historian-of-mathematics persona; corrections applied.
