# Q174 Debate: Is D9.1e too strong as written?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does the non-symmetry statement for left ordering overgeneralize beyond the stated domain assumptions?

## Recommendation
No. It is presented as a generic chart-level condition with explicit caveats (compactness/periodicity assumptions and no claim of full extension theory).
