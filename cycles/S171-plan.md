# S171 — Study dualities as refinement equivalences for uncuttable Section 4

## Goal
Investigate how classical dualities (Kramers–Wannier, T-duality,
Montonen–Olive) can be understood as equivalences between different
refinement descriptions of the same underlying object, for use in
Section 4 of the uncuttable paper.

## Scope
- Kramers–Wannier duality for the 2D Ising model.
- T-duality in string theory (R ↔ α'/R).
- Montonen–Olive / S-duality and its SL(2,ℤ) extension.
- Framing these as "multiple descriptions of the same limit object"
  within the refinement programme.

## Output
Blackboard note suitable for promotion as a remark in Section 4.
