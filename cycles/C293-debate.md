# C293 Debate: Is bounded-potential error control enough for this stage?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Should Package A now demand nonperturbative constructive control, or is explicit bounded-potential error control a valid intermediate closure step?

## Options
1. Jump directly to full constructive regime.
2. Add explicit bounded-potential error bounds now and defer full constructive closure.

## Decision
Option 2.

## Rationale
The manuscript currently needs technically explicit progression with controlled assumptions. Bounded-potential error bounds materially strengthen D12.2 without overclaiming nonperturbative completeness.

## Consequences / Follow-ups
- Later S/C chain can target stronger potential classes (Kato/form-bounded) if needed.
