# S03 Execution

## Work
- Wrote a blackboard note clarifying what “perturbative analyticity” can mean when couplings are dimensionful:
  analyticity is naturally in *dimensionless* couplings \(\hat g(\mu)\), but then requiring a universal \(\mu\)-independent constant forces either an engineering-dimension monomial (sieve) or a non-analytic transmutation scale (outside H2.5b).
- Extracted two promotion candidates to tighten H2.5b wording in the Planck-area draft (not promoted yet).

## Result
- New note: `blackboards/2026-02-10-h2-5b-meaning.md`.

## Status
Completed.
