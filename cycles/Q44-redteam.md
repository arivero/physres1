# Q44 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Over-scoping**: readers think the paper is claiming to solve vacuum energy.
2. **Tone shift**: foundations narrative gets bogged down in caveats.
3. **Redundancy**: the disclaimer repeats later boundary audits.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the disclaimer strictly negative ("separate issue"), no claims.
2. Keep it to one sentence.
3. If later audits cover it, remove here and point forward.
