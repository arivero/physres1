# C14 Debate

## Claim
An explicit beta-function computation is the minimal evidence needed to justify “RG is definitional” as more than philosophy.

## Objection
Any one computation risks being dismissed as model-specific.

## Resolution
Keep the computation explicitly model-specific but highlight which steps are structural (composition, regulator dependence, subtraction, semigroup property).

## Status
Closed (explicit 2D delta beta function + scheme dependence + rooted-tree bridge added).
