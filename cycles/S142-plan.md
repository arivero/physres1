# S142 Plan: Wilson's renormalization group as refinement management

Date: 2026-02-13

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md` (potential)

## Scope
Study Wilson's RG (blocking transformation, fixed points, universality) as the definitive framework for the "uncuttable" refinement-limit pattern. The blocking transformation is the refinement map, relevant operators are counterterms, and the continuum limit is controlled by RG fixed points. Blackboard slot 1.
