## Q112 findings
1. Berry phase formula γ_n = i∮⟨n|∇_R n⟩·dR: **CORRECT** (standard sign convention).
2. Gap condition phrasing: **CORRECT** (informal but appropriate for a structural remark).
3. "Exponentially suppressed": **FIXED** — reviewer noted exponential suppression requires analyticity of H(R); for smooth non-analytic cases, suppression is polynomial. Softened to "suppressed" without specifying rate.
4. Logical flow 3.1→3.5: reviewer found it slightly abrupt but acknowledged connection exists. No change needed — the opening "another instance of the same refinement pattern" provides the transition.
5. Connection to Section 4: well-motivated.
6. No other factual errors found.
