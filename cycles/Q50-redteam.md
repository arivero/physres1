# Q50 Red Team: What a Referee Could Still Object To (Post-C93)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Likely objections
- “Appendix headings imply missing content”:
  - Mitigation: ensure Section 10 intro sentence clearly states these are worked extensions (already done).
- “Lecture notes are not archival”:
  - Mitigation: treat as attribution only; be ready to replace with a textbook/journal anchor if requested.
