# S286 Plan: Two-particle composition test for κ universality
Date: 2026-02-14
Parent: D32

## Goal
Calculate the two-particle free propagator with independent action scales (κ₁, κ₂) and check whether composition closure forces κ₁ = κ₂.

## Method
1. Write tensor-product kernel K₁⊗K₂ with separate (m₁,κ₁) and (m₂,κ₂).
2. Check semigroup composition for decoupled case.
3. Check composition for coupled case (interaction V(q₁,q₂) ≠ 0).
4. Identify mechanism if universality is forced.

## Deliverable
Blackboard slot 4 with explicit calculation and verdict.
