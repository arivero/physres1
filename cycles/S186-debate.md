# S186 Debate: Dipole Selection Rules Blackboard

## Key Outcomes

### Δl = ±1 Rule
Essential to mention polar structure (Clebsch-Gordan, operator coupling) even though paper focus is azimuthal. Polar constraint is the physical root of selection rules; omitting it would confuse readers expecting standard dipole transition theory.

### Photon Angular Momentum
π-photon (linear polarization) carries zero z-component of angular momentum, not ℏ. σ±-photons (circular) carry ±ℏ. This distinction clarifies why Δm = ±1 is tied to σ± modes.

### Remark Structure
Selection rules fit naturally after Remark 3.1 (azimuthal Fourier structure) as a concrete application showing how orthogonality forbids unphysical transitions.

## Consensus
All corrections are physics-sound and tighten the pedagogical narrative. Ready for promotion.
