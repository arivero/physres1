# C37 Plan

## Goal
Make the minimal precision tweak queued by `Q05` in `papers/delta-objects/main.md`:
1. soften the §3.4 statement so it does not suggest \(\delta'\) is the generic “corner term” (often the corner term is \(\delta\); \(\delta'\) appears at higher order),
2. optionally add a one-line pointer to the distribution toolbox note.

## Scope
1. Edit `papers/delta-objects/main.md` (micro-edit only).
2. Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Non-Goals
- No new bibliography ingestion.
- No edits to `paper/main.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
1. §3.4 no longer overstates \(\delta'\); it refers to derivatives of delta kernels by order.
