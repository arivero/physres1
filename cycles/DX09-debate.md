# DX09 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Hard question
Is expanding existing thin papers more valuable than starting a new satellite?
## Resolution
For the rest of this session (limited time), expanding existing papers gives immediate, committable results. Starting a new satellite requires S+B+C+Q (~4 cycles minimum) and would likely span multiple sessions. The right strategy is: finish content expansion now, plan new satellite (item B) as the next session's anchor.
