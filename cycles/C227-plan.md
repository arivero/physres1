# C227 Plan: Promote Dipole Selection Rules Remark

## Objective
Promote S186 blackboard content into Remark 3.2 of action-angle paper (Section 3).

## Scope
- Insert Remark 3.2 after Remark 3.1 (line ~53)
- Content: Δm from azimuthal Fourier orthogonality, Δl from polar Clebsch-Gordan structure, photon angular momentum qℏ, Zeeman demonstration, connection to Section 4 Fourier tradeoff
- Ensure no cycle labels (S186, C227, etc.) in prose
- No transcript citations

## Methods
1. Copy corrected blackboard text
2. Format as Remark 3.2 with proper sectioning
3. Add cross-references (Remark 3.1, Section 4)
4. Run diffstat check
5. Run cycle-tag and transcript leak checks

## Expected Output
Remark 3.2 inserted; paper diffstat +8 -0 (approximate, may vary).
