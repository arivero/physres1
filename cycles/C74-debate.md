# C74 Debate: How Technical Should the Manuscript Be Here?

## Question
Should `paper/main.md` name the theorem-level fact (no Haar/Lebesgue measure in infinite dimensions), or should it keep the statement fully informal?

## Current Resolution
Name the obstruction in one sentence but keep it heuristic and operational: state the minimal property that fails (translation-invariant measure finite on neighborhoods), then immediately translate it to the practical moral (refinement limits are constructions with normalization/regulator data).
