# C211 — Debate

## Summary
Clean promotion. The S170 blackboard had already been corrected in
response to all four reviewer objections, so no further changes were
needed during promotion.

The remark fits naturally after Remark 2.7 (which discusses asymptotic
series in the refinement context) by providing the concrete mechanism
(resurgence) through which non-perturbative information is encoded in
perturbative coefficients.

No issues raised during promotion.
