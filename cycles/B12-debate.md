# B12 Debate: OA-first vs sci-hub for historical journal articles

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
For pre-1960 journal articles (Dirac 1933, Groenewold 1946, Moyal 1949), is sci-hub the appropriate primary acquisition channel, or should we insist on OA/institutional routes?

## Decision
Use OA when available (Dirac was found via informationphilosopher.com); use sci-hub only when explicitly authorized by the user and when OA routes have been exhausted. Mark items that fail both routes as `PENDING_LIBRARY`.

## Rationale
1. Pre-1960 articles are often not digitized in OA repositories (no arXiv, no PMC).
2. The user explicitly authorized sci-hub.kvnp.top for this session.
3. Groenewold1946 was not available even on sci-hub's CDN — the DOI with encoded parentheses returned 404. This confirms that sci-hub coverage is incomplete for very old Physica articles.
4. For books (Connes1994, Landsman1998), sci-hub does not apply — these genuinely require a library visit.
