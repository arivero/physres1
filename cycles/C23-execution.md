# C23 Execution

## Changes
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md`
   - Split H2.5 explicitly into H2.5a (integrality/monomial sieve) vs H2.5b (perturbative analyticity sieve), and clarified that RG transmutation is a separate non-analytic branch.
   - Added an explicit “transmutation as a branch” item to the hypothesis-relaxation list to prevent branch leakage.
   - Added a citation to `[VanVleck1928Correspondence]` at the semiclassical-prefactor derivation as an external anchor for the “Van Vleck type” discussion.
2. `paper/main.md`
   - Added a `[VanVleck1928Correspondence]` anchor at `Derivation D4.3`.
   - Added a `[Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials]` anchor at the entry point to Appendix 10.5 (2D delta RG witness).
3. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`
   - Added `[Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials]` as an independent standard anchor for the 2D/3D delta discussion and for the 3D scattering-length parameterization remarks.
