# S83 Plan: 2D delta resolvent — Van Vleck vs transmutation separation

Date: 2026-02-13

## Thread
Half-densities / Planck-area ladder (thread 2). Targets Open Problem #2.

## Goal
Make PA-E5b concrete: write out G₀(x,z;E) for the 2D free particle, the T-matrix T(E) with transmutation scale κ_*, and the full resolvent G = G₀ + G₀TG₀. Show explicitly that:
1. G₀ carries the bi-half-density weight (d/2 = 1 for d = 2) via its K₀ Bessel function normalization.
2. T(E) is a scalar amplitude containing κ_* — the transmutation scale from PA-E5.
3. The composed resolvent inherits the half-density weight from G₀ factors, while the scalarization scale comes from T(E) via κ_*.
4. The scalarization constant has dimension length^{d/2} = length for d = 2.

## Scope
One blackboard note. No manuscript edits.
