# B11 Debate: Is a GREEN-OA author repository copy acceptable as the primary capture?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
For classic papers where the publisher PDF is blocked in this environment, should we treat a GREEN-OA author/institution repository PDF as sufficient for local capture and “acquired” status in the ledger?

## Decision
Yes—provided the repository URL is clearly lawful and stable (institutional domain; explicit OA indicator from a reputable index when available).

## Rationale
The repo’s “sources/” captures are for lawful local archiving and for sanity-checking claims, not for asserting publisher provenance. When publisher endpoints are bot-challenged, institutional repositories are the cleanest OA alternative.
