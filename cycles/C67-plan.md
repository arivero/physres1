# C67 Plan: Promote Cross-Dimensional Data-Space Bridge

## Goal
Promote the S40 data-space map as a concise heuristic in Section 5.8 of the RG draft.

## Scope
- Add one short remark after Proposition P1.6.
- Clarify that dimensional differences change flowed-data complexity, not the compatibility principle itself.

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript edit is substantive.
- No new unsupported technical claims are introduced.
- `cycles/C67-execution.md` logs manuscript diffstat.
