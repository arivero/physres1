# S53 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim**: presenting the dimension link as a theorem about nature rather than a conditional statement ("if we postulate fixed areal speed, then...").
2. **Confusion about dimensions**: mixing spatial dimension \(n\) with spacetime dimension \(D\).
3. **Hidden conventions**: using a \(D=4\) Planck-length identity without stating it.

## Mitigations
1. Keep all statements conditional and tied to the specific mechanical witness.
2. Use \(n\) for spatial dimension and state \(D=n+1\) when needed.
3. State explicitly where the \(D=4\) identity \(L_P^2=G\hbar/c^3\) is used and why it is special.
