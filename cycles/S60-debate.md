# S60 Debate: Does the \(G\) Cancellation Mean Anything?

## Question
Is the cancellation of \(G\) in \(r=4\hbar/(Mc)\) meaningful or just an artifact of choosing Planck units?

## Current Resolution
It is a real algebraic cancellation tied to the 4D definitions of \(\ell_P,t_P\) and the areal-velocity invariant.
Interpretation should be cautious: Newtonian dynamics fails when \(M\) is large enough that \(v\) becomes relativistic, and dimension-dependence should be checked before treating it as a universal "filter."
