# C330 Execution: Promote single-axiom P4.2 to cornerstone (Remark P4.2h)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Target
paper/main.md (cornerstone), Section 10 (after Remark P4.2g)

## Sources
D50 ((D) derivability), D53 (identity limit derivability), notebook Part 5

## Changes
- Added Remark P4.2h (Composition as single master axiom)
- Explains axiom reduction: (D) derivable from (C) on ℝ^d, (I) derivable from
  explicit kernel form (nascent delta) or Stone's theorem
- States effective count: 1 axiom (composition) + physical setup
- Forward reference to [RCPFoundations] Section 6

## Diffstat
+3/-0 (net +3 lines). MARGINAL by line count but high content density
(~80 words in 3 lines). This is a focused remark extending the P4.2a-g series,
not a standalone section.

## Productivity check (Rule 9)
- Net lines: 3 (below threshold)
- Justification: Remark P4.2h completes the P4.2 hypothesis-reduction series
  (c-g) started in C312-C314. It's a capstone remark, not a standalone cycle.
  Batched with C329 (RCP foundations, +10 net lines) in the same commit window.
- Status: MARGINAL (batched with C329)

## Guard checks
- Cycle-tag leak: CLEAN
- conv_patched: CLEAN
