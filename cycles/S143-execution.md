# S143 Execution: Ehrenfest time

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work Done
- Wrote blackboard slot 0: Ehrenfest time as temporal boundary of classical orbit picture. Algebraic (integrable) vs logarithmic (chaotic) dispersal timescales.
- Semiclassical dynamics expert reviewed: all 8 claims CORRECT. Ehrenfest theorem, quadratic exactness, free spreading, t_E formula, √ℏ initial size, algebraic-vs-logarithmic contrast, all references verified.
