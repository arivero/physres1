# Q66 Debate: Any concerns with D9.1a?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Is the remark mathematically and editorially sound?

## Assessment
Yes. The formula was independently verified. The half-density connection claim is standard differential geometry. The cross-reference to HD-D1.3 is informational ("cf."), not load-bearing. The placement between D9.1 and P9.1 is natural — it enriches the evidence before the general proposition.

No concerns identified.
