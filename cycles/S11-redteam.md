## Failure Modes
1. Confusing “delta in time” impulses with “delta in space” point interactions (distinct mechanisms).
2. Overstating regularity: distributional E–L is correct, but existence/uniqueness of minimizers with corners needs hypotheses.
3. Losing the half-density thread: this is a support computation, not a new main thesis.

## Mitigations
- Keep the toy model explicitly 1D in time, and label the impulse example as “delta forcing in time”.
- State assumptions (compactly supported variations; fixed endpoints) and keep claims local.
- End with a short promotion queue linking back to half-density/delta-kernel language.
