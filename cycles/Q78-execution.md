# Q78 Execution: Referee pass on C122 (Remark PA-H2.6b)

Date: 2026-02-13

## Findings

### Necessity claims
1. **Drop PA-H2.1:** if composition doesn't force d/2, the exponent is conventional and no physical length^{d/2} scale is required. ✓
2. **Drop PA-H2.4:** metric-derived σ_g = |g|^{1/4}|dx|^{1/2} provides scalarization in any d without a new constant. ✓
3. **Drop PA-H2.5a:** transmutation (PA-H2.13/PA-D1.6a) supplies scales in any d via non-analytic RG invariants. ✓
4. **Drop gravity-only:** additional couplings (e.g., a mass parameter with [m] = length^{-1}) can supply length scales in any d. ✓

### Cross-references
- PA-D1.4a reference: correct (the free-propagator semigroup derivation from C120).
- PA-H2.1, PA-H2.4, PA-H2.5a: all defined earlier in Section 3.1.

### Structural checks
- No cycle tags: PASS
- No internal references: PASS
- PA-label namespace: PA-H2.6b between PA-H2.6 and PA-H2.6a. Consistent.

## Verdict
**Clean pass.** All four necessity claims verified. No corrections required.
