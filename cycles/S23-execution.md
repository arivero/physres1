# S23 Execution: Momentum Point-Interactions Along the Path

## Work Completed
- Wrote a focused blackboard note separating spatial point potentials from time-localized action defects (impulses/corners).
- Derived the momentum jump condition from a delta-in-time action term and recorded a short path-integral/time-slicing interpretation as an insertion/kick.
- Added a cautionary remark on \(\delta'\) terms and how they should be understood via pairing/regularization.
