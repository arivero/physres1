## Failure modes
1. **Risk of over-claiming the parallel**: The stochastic and quantum cases are structurally analogous but mechanistically different — stochastic non-uniqueness arises from non-differentiability (quadratic variation), while quantum non-uniqueness arises from operator non-commutativity. The remark is careful to say "parallels" rather than "is the same as."
2. **Regularity assumptions**: f ∈ C² is stated explicitly. The subagent noted this is stronger than strictly necessary (C¹ with Hölder derivative suffices), but C² is the standard textbook condition and avoids unnecessary technicality.
