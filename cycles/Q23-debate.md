# Q23 Debate: Is D1.5i Too Applied for This Draft Stage?

## Question
Does the observability checklist push the draft too far into phenomenology before formal foundations are complete?

## Current Resolution
It is appropriately minimal:
- no new empirical model is introduced,
- only testability conditions for existing postulates are made explicit,
- this improves falsifiability discipline without changing core theory claims.
