# S70 Plan: D=4 conformal half-density result -- RG-side analog check

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Check whether the D=4 conformal half-density result (D(4-D)/4 coefficient vanishing) has an RG-side analog, clarifying the DX01 "dimension-selection asymmetry" anomaly.

## Deliverable (keep bounded)
- Target: 1-2 page analysis comparing the half-density D=4 filter with candidate RG-side D=4 statements.
- Output file(s):
  - `blackboards/2026-02-12-rg-side-d4-echo.md`
