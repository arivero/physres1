# S269 Debate: Is the derivation too heuristic?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does fixed-\(L\) asymptotic scaling provide enough rigor for promotion?

## Resolution
Yes for remark-level promotion. The paper already uses effective-potential asymptotics; this note formalizes the scaling logic and states scope conditions explicitly.
