# Q46 Debate: Should we add a citation for the central-potential separation witness?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
Do we need to cite a QM textbook for \(\psi\propto e^{im\phi}\) in central potentials?

## Decision
No citation required: this is a short, explicit derivation in-text and is standard background.
