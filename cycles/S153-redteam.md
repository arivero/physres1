# S153 Red Team: Schwinger pair production blackboard

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Rate formula: blackboard prefactor was αE²/π² (dimensionally wrong). Promoted remark uses m²(E/E_cr)² exp(-πE_cr/E).
- Non-perturbative characterization: stated as "essential singularity" rather than misleading "exp(-const/α)."
