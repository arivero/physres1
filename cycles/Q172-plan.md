# Q172 Plan: Referee pass on C289 cross-package wave

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C289`: cross-package promotion wave in `paper/main.md`

## Goal
Referee-pass the C289 manuscript changes for correctness, notation consistency, claim hygiene, and reader flow.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q172-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `notebooks/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Claim boundaries remain explicit (derivation vs heuristic).
- Added RG and kernel witnesses are mathematically coherent at stated scope.
- New package language is clearly editorial and not mixed with theorem notation.
- Remaining gaps are turned into specific follow-up cycles.

## Acceptance criteria
- Findings list with at least one concrete next-cycle action.
