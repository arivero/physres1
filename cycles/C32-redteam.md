## Failure Modes
1. Introducing half-density jargon that distracts from the RG computation.
2. Overclaiming “RG fixes scalarization” rather than “RG invariants can supply scales if one insists on dimensionless scalar representatives”.

## Mitigations
- Keep it to one short heuristic paragraph.
- Keep convention vs physics separation explicit.
