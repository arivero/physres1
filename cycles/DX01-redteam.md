# DX01 Red Team: exploration risks

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes
- **"Novelty" is only renaming:**
  - The symplectic-Euler identification (Finding 1) is known in the numerical-methods literature (Nauenberg 1994 is already in our B13 search). The novelty is not the identification itself but the *cross-thread connection* within the manuscript's architecture.
  - Mitigation: S69 should derive the connection in the manuscript's notation and clarify what the manuscript adds beyond the known result.

- **Berkeley citation is ornamental:**
  - The Analyst is famous but might be "mere decoration" without a substantive connection to the manuscript's technical content.
  - Mitigation: The connection IS substantive — Berkeley's critique targets exactly the "evanescent quantity" problem that the manuscript's constructive refinement framework addresses. But keep the citation to one sentence; do not write a history-of-math section.

- **RCP tautology risk is unfixable:**
  - If the debate conclusion is that RCP is meta-principial, noting this doesn't help — it just highlights a weakness.
  - Mitigation: meta-principles (relativity, gauge invariance) are standard in physics. The value is in the specific structural predictions, not in the principle's logical status. A future S cycle could explicitly list "structural predictions of RCP" that are checkable.

- **Anomaly register inflation:**
  - Three new anomaly entries from a single DX cycle might create noise.
  - Mitigation: entries are genuinely distinct (cross-thread, dimension-selection, falsifiability). Each has a clear status and next action.
