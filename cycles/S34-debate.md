# S34 Debate: Is Projection Choice a Gauge Freedom or Physics Input?

## Question
When choosing \(\mathbf n\) for projected areal rate, is this merely gauge/coordinates, or part of physical model specification?

## Current Resolution
Treat \(\mathbf n\) as model input tied to measurement protocol:
- in central planar models, \(\mathbf n\) is naturally the orbital normal;
- in perturbed/non-planar settings, \(\mathbf n\) must be explicitly chosen (e.g., source spin axis or detector-frame axis);
- therefore it is not pure gauge once empirical claims are made.
