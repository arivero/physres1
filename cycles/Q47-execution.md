# Q47 Execution: Referee Pass on Action–Angle Dependent Note

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C89`

## Findings
- The note is appropriately bounded for a foundations clarification: it gives one explicit \((\phi,L_z)\) witness, avoids the angle-operator detour, and keeps “outlook” clearly separated from what is actually shown.
- Claim hygiene is good: it does not drift into force-range assertions and it frames the result as a Fourier/conjugacy tradeoff rather than as a new “uncertainty principle.”
- The explicit Dirichlet-kernel packet example is a good choice: it makes the tradeoff concrete without additional citations.
- One minor style risk: the phrase “maximal delocalization” could invite pedantry; “delocalized / uniform” language is already sufficient and safer.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- None required for correctness.

## Optional follow-ups
- `C90`: add a short remark in `paper/main.md` near the semiclassical/stationary-phase discussion pointing to this \((\phi,L_z)\) witness as a concrete “eigenstates vs packets” example.
- `D03`: do a pass over recent `blackboards/2026-02-10-*.md` to select the next novelty target for promotion waves (discovery-first, then `S/B/C`).
