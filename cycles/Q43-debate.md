# Q43 Debate: Does the Soft-Extremum Witness Need a Reference?

## Question
Should we add a bibliography anchor for the Laplace-principle / log-sum-exp limit?

## Current Resolution
Not yet. The statement is a short, standard asymptotic fact and is presented as a finite-dimensional witness, not a historical claim.
If reviewers demand, add an OA large-deviations/Laplace-method reference in a `B` cycle later.
