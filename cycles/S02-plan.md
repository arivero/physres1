# S02 Plan

## Goal
Explore (blackboard-first) whether “scalarization gauge” for half-densities can be interpreted as (or related to) wavefunction renormalization / anomalous dimensions, i.e. whether RG running naturally appears as scale-dependence of the scalarization choice.

## Scope
1. Write one blackboard note proposing a precise toy-level statement:
   - how a scale-dependent reference half-density \(\sigma_\ast(\mu)\) compares to a field-strength renormalization factor \(Z(\mu)\),
   - which parts are pure representation choice vs which parts are fixed by composition/normalization conditions.
2. Include at least one concrete mini-model:
   - free kernel semigroup normalization (\(t^{-d/2}\)) as the “geometric” baseline,
   - then add a multiplicative running factor and interpret it.

## Non-Goals
- Do not promote to manuscripts in this cycle.
- Do not add new bibliography items unless a clear load-bearing reference is identified.

## Acceptance Tests
1. A new blackboard note exists with ≥2 promotion candidates (short, stable statements) clearly marked.
2. Any conjectural link to QFT renormalization is explicitly labeled as heuristic.
