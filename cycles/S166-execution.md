# S166 Execution: Zeta-function regularization for uncuttable Section 2

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work performed
- Mathematical physicist reviewer confirmed all claims: ζ(−1)=−1/12, spectral determinant formula, Hawking reference are correct.
- Minor clarification: "regularized value" wording tightened; string theory connection noted to involve both ζ(0) (conformal anomaly) and ζ(−1) (Casimir energy).

## Result
- All claims stable; ready for promotion as Remark 2.7 via C207.

## Discovery flag
- **No.** Standard confirmations, no surprises.
