# B01 Debate

## Question
Which claims are “load-bearing enough” to justify adding a new standard reference, versus staying self-contained with derivations and using citations only for attribution?

## Current Resolution (working)
Add references only for widely-known but referee-sensitive facts (e.g., Van Vleck prefactor / semiclassics, point-interaction classification, delta renormalization lore). Keep the core thesis carried by in-text derivations.
