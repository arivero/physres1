# C111 Debate: Placement and scope of D9.1a

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Should the remark go after D9.1 (extending the computation) or after P9.1 (as a separate worked example)?

## Decision
After D9.1, before P9.1.

## Rationale
D9.1a is a direct extension of D9.1's computation to a richer symbol. Placing it before P9.1 means the general proposition (P9.1) now subsumes both the linear and quadratic examples, strengthening it as a summary statement. Placing it after P9.1 would make it an afterthought rather than supporting evidence.

## Scope check
The remark is 8 lines — concise enough for an appendix extension. It states the formula, notes the physical application, and gives the half-density bridge in one sentence. No over-engineering.
