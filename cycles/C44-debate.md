# C44 Debate: Does \u03b4' Belong in the RG Draft?

## Hard Question
Is adding the distributional identity
\((\delta(\cdot+\varepsilon)-\delta)/\varepsilon\to\delta'\)
to `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` a distraction from RG-as-compatibility?

## Current Resolution
Include it, but only as a **one-paragraph contact-term remark**:
- It reinforces the pattern “regulated object \(\to\) subtraction/limit \(\to\) new distribution” that is structurally the same as renormalization.
- It anticipates why derivatives of deltas show up as contact terms in field theory (Ward identities, operator mixing), without pulling the draft into a full distribution-theory detour.
- The more detailed development lives in the S15 blackboard note and the delta-objects synthesis note.
