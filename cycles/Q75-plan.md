# Q75 Plan: Referee pass on C119 (planck-area standalone cleanup)

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle
- `C119`: removed 7 internal repo references from `papers/planck-area/main.md`

## Goal
Verify standalone cleanup preserved technical correctness and no internal references remain.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q75-*.md` only

## Checklist
- All 7 edits preserve original technical claims
- No internal repo references remain
- Section 6 rewrite is coherent for an external reader
- PA-E5a three-level hierarchy still makes sense without cross-references
