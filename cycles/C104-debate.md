# C104 Debate: Is this too small for a C cycle?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
A one-word label rename is below the "preferably verbose" promotion bar for C cycles. Should this have been deferred?

## Decision
Proceed. The rename fixes a taxonomy inconsistency that would confuse any reader or agent trying to parse the label system. It was explicitly spawned by Q60 and bundling it with C103 would have required re-opening that cycle.

## Rationale
The cycle system's "preferably verbose" guidance is a preference, not a hard rule. The hard rule is "C cycles must change at least one manuscript" — this one does. The micro-edit is justified by its taxonomy-hygiene purpose.
