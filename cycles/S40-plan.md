# S40 Plan: Cross-Dimensional Contact-Flow Data Map

## Goal
Construct a compact \(1\)D/\(2\)D/\(3\)D map of the effective data being renormalized to support a Section 5.8 bridge remark.

## Scope
1. Summarize dimensional differences in contact descriptors.
2. Identify the corresponding compatibility data space.
3. Extract one concise manuscript insertion target.

## Acceptance Tests
- Map is consistent with existing draft claims.
- No new unsupported source claims are introduced.
- Clear `C67` promotion item.
