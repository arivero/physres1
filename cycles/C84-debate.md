# C84 Debate: Is Euclideanization Legitimate in a Foundations Argument?

## Question
Does using an Euclidean (Laplace-principle) witness weaken the real-time foundations narrative?

## Current Resolution
No, if we present it as a finite-dimensional, fully controlled witness for the logic "softened composition \(\to\) hard extremum as a limit,"
and explicitly note that real-time uses stationary phase rather than positivity.
The point is the *mathematical pattern* (stable composition + sharpening parameter), not the signature.
