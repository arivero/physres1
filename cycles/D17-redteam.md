## Failure modes
1. Over-claiming universality outside fixed-\(L\) asymptotic power-law analysis.
2. Confusing the asymptotic threshold mechanism with the separate \(q=2\) dimensional identity.
3. Adding too much satellite-level derivation into the main narrative.

## Mitigations
1. State assumptions explicitly: high-momentum kinetic degree \(\nu\), fixed \(L\), small-\(r\) comparison.
2. Include one sentence separating threshold and dimensional mechanisms.
3. Keep full derivation in S-cycle notes; promote only a compact reader-facing remark.
