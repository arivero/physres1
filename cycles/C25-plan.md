# C25 Plan

## Goal
Promote the S03 clarification of H2.5b (“analyticity for dimensionful couplings needs a reference scale \(\mu\)”) into the Planck-area draft, in a way that preserves the branch separation (sieve vs transmutation) and avoids overclaiming.

## Scope
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md`
   - Add a short labeled heuristic clarifying H2.5b for dimensionful couplings: analyticity is naturally in dimensionless couplings \(\hat g(\mu)\); demanding \(\mu\)-independent universal constants then forces either the monomial sieve or transmutation (outside H2.5b).

## Acceptance Tests
1. The H2.5b paragraph no longer reads as “analytic in dimensionful couplings without scale”.
2. No new citations required.
