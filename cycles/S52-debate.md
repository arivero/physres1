# S52 Debate: Expand Paper Set or Deepen Existing Threads?

## Question
Should we open new dependent drafts for every leftover conversation theme, or deepen a small number of existing drafts until they are submission-quality?

## Current Resolution
Prefer deepening existing drafts unless a theme truly needs a new home. In particular:
- generic-\(q\) areal-speed belongs in `papers/planck-area/main.md`,
- \(\tau\) formalization belongs first in `paper/notes/` then minimally in `paper/main.md`,
- gauge/string-tension deserves a new draft only after at least one solid `B` cycle.
