# C63 Execution: Promote Uncertainty Addendum

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5k` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` after D1.5j.
- Promoted compact first-order uncertainty templates for:
  - \(q=\dot A_{\mathbf n}\),
  - \(\mathcal T_{\mathbf n}\),
  with covariance/Jacobian form and a nonlinear cross-check caveat.
- Kept the note short and branch-scoped.
