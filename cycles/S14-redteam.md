## Failure Modes
1. Overclaiming that \(\hbar\) is “derived” rather than “structurally required as an action scale”.
2. Confusing UV regulators (cutoffs) with the semiclassical small parameter \(\hbar\).
3. Repeating known textbook material without tying it to the repo’s half-density/composition constraints.

## Mitigations
- Phrase the conclusion as “\(\hbar\)-like constant is forced by dimensional and composition requirements”, not “\(\hbar\) is predicted”.
- Keep UV-cutoff remarks as analogy only (if mentioned at all).
- Include one explicit check: delta normalization of the short-time kernel fixes the \(\hbar\)-dependent prefactor exponent.
