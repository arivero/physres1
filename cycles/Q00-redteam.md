## Failure Modes to Watch
1. “Polished but unverified”: professional tone without computation/derivation anchors.
2. “Notation drift”: silent switches in what \(d\) refers to; silent unit conventions.
3. “Hidden scale choices”: measure/normalization choices reintroduced under a different name.
4. “Citation theater”: adding references that do not actually support the claim.

## Mitigations
- Demand one worked computation per major conceptual move (already a repo guardrail).
- Require each derivation to state its hypotheses explicitly.
- Use B-cycles only for load-bearing anchors; keep citations minimal and honest.
