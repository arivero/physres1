# D04 Red Team: Risks in “Finishing Research” via Source Ingest

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Time sink on blocked endpoints:
  - Mitigation: cap attempts; record the block and move on.
- Accidentally treating non-OA mirrors as acceptable:
  - Mitigation: use only clearly lawful/open sources; otherwise keep `PENDING`.
- Confusing “ledger updated” with “manuscript improved”:
  - Mitigation: keep `B` cycles focused on acquisition/verification; only promote via later `C` cycles if wording or citations change.
