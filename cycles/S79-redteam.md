# S79 Red Team: What could be wrong with the odd-dimension analysis?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Likely objections
- **Objection**: "The fermionic escape route undermines the categorical nature of the odd-d exclusion. If Yukawa couplings have half-integer dimensions for odd d, then in a theory with fermions the parity obstruction is lifted."
  - Mitigation: Correct — the parity obstruction holds only for couplings with integer length dimensions. The blackboard explicitly notes this and identifies it as a structural observation: "the parity obstruction for odd d is lifted if and only if at least one admitted coupling has a half-integer length dimension." The gravity-only sieve (PA-D1.3) is stated under the gravity-only hypothesis. Adding fermions changes the coupling set and the sieve outcome. The analysis is correctly scoped.

- **Objection**: "The three-mechanism classification (parity / magnitude / degenerate) is just a restatement of 'd=4 is unique' — does it add anything?"
  - Mitigation: It adds structural insight: the *reason* d=4 is unique has three qualitatively different components. Odd d fails for a fundamentally different reason (parity) than even d ≥ 6 (magnitude). This distinction matters if one wants to understand which relaxations of PA-H2.5a would open new solutions: relaxing integrality opens even d (via fractional k), but only admitting half-integer-dimensional couplings opens odd d. The classification is finer-grained than the bare uniqueness statement.
