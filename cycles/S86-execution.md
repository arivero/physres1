# S86 Execution: Cross-paper notation audit

Date: 2026-02-13

## Dimension notation: d vs D

| Paper | Convention | Context | Consistent? |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| planck-area | Mixed d+D | d=generic, D=spacetime | Yes (explicit remark at line 17-18) |
| rg-fundamental | Lowercase d | Spatial/loop (QM context) | Yes |
| half-density-qft | Uppercase D | Spacetime (QFT context) | Yes |
| relativistic-central-orbits | Metric differentials | ds², dθ, dφ (no dim notation) | N/A |
| delta-objects | Lowercase d | Generic manifold | Yes |
| fermionic-mediators | Uppercase D | Spacetime integration (QFT) | Yes |
| action-angle-indeterminacy | None | No dimension notation | N/A |
| uncuttable-controlled-refinement | None | No dimension notation | N/A |

## Assessment
**No inconsistencies within individual papers.** The cross-paper variation is coherent:
- QFT papers use D (spacetime convention)
- QM/geometry papers use d (spatial/manifold convention)
- Planck-area paper explicitly distinguishes both with a bookkeeping remark

This is defensible and does not need correction. Each paper's choice follows its context.

## No action needed
No C cycle required. The notation is consistent within each paper and the cross-paper pattern is sensible.
