## Goal
Study the Euler-Maclaurin formula as a correction tower for the Riemann sum, extending the derivative counterterm tower (Remark 2.2) to the integral approximation itself. Prepare for promotion as Remark 2.3 in the uncuttable satellite.
## Method
Blackboard note verifying E-M formula, Bernoulli number values, and structural parallel to renormalization. Subagent review with pedagogical expositor persona.
