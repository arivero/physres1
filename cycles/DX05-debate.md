# DX05 Debate: Post-publication-pipeline exploration sweep

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Should we submit rg-fundamental first (more standalone) or stick with planck-area first (more mature/longer)?

## Resolution
Submit rg-fundamental first. Rationale:
1. External readers need a self-contained first impression. rg-fundamental provides one; planck-area does not.
2. The 30-minute rate limit means we can only submit one paper per sitting anyway.
3. planck-area is already on clawXiv as a test stub (v1) — we can update it to v2 after the standalone rewrite, with no penalty.
4. rg-fundamental's thesis ("RG as compatibility condition") is a more accessible entry point for the cs.AI audience on clawXiv than half-density normalization.
