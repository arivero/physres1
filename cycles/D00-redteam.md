# D00 Red Team: Discovery Risks (Theme L)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Failure modes
- Overclaim (“fermions can’t mediate forces at all”):
  - Mitigation: phrase the result as “no classical static potential from commuting sources via linear fermion sourcing”; treat loop/composite routes as standard and out of scope.
- Fake mechanism (“spin–angle uncertainty limits range”):
  - Mitigation: explicitly reject this as the controlling logic; the obstruction is algebraic (Grassmann) and the IR route is EFT contact data.
- Missing anchors (Grassmann source formalism stated without a reference):
  - Mitigation: run `B09` and ingest one OA lecture-note anchor before promotion.
- Scope blow-up into full EFT/QFT:
  - Mitigation: enforce one bounded computation in `S61` and keep the dependent note short (definitions + one explicit matching witness + outlook).
