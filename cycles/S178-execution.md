# S178 Execution
Blackboard 0: CS equation as differential refinement compatibility. Reviewed by QFT theorist: caught (1) sign convention ambiguous without specifying Green function type, (2) 'physical observables independent of μ' imprecise, (3) cross-reference to fermionic Examples 5.1-5.2 overstated. All fixed in promotion.
