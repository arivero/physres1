# C316 Plan: Add 2D Delta RG Example to Rooted-Tree Paper

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Expand rooted-tree paper Section 4 with concrete one-loop RG example (2D delta interaction)

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md` (expand Section 4)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Section 4.4: "Worked Example: 2D Delta Interaction (One-Loop)"
- Content: Setup, tree diagram, counterterm, beta function, dimensional transmutation
- Explicit parallel to midpoint RK (both single-node trees, both composition laws)
- ~30-40 lines addition (expand paper from 5pp to ~7pp)

Out of scope:
- Two-loop extension (defer)
- Full BPHZ forest formula (keep to one-loop)

## Minimum promotion bar
Add Section 4.4 with substantive RG calculation (~30-40 lines)

## Source
- Blackboard slot 1 (S298, 167 lines) — extract key formulas + tree interpretation

## Allowed files
- `papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md`
- `cycles/C316-*.md`

## Acceptance criteria
- Section 4.4 added
- Diffstat recorded
- No cycle IDs in manuscript
- Compiled page count: target ~7pp
