# Q72 Red Team: What a referee would attack in PA-D1.3a

Date: 2026-02-12

## Likely referee objections
- **Objection**: "The parity obstruction is claimed to be 'categorical regardless of which integer-dimensional couplings are admitted.' But what about couplings with half-integer dimensions (e.g. Yukawa in odd d)? This qualifier is missing."
  - Mitigation: PA-D1.3a explicitly says "couplings with integer length dimensions." This qualifier correctly scopes the claim. The S79 blackboard notes the fermionic escape route but PA-D1.3a does not overclaim beyond integer-dimensional couplings. Acceptable as stated.

- **Objection**: "For even d ≥ 6, adding more couplings (Λ_d, gauge couplings) can provide solutions (PA-E2). So the 'magnitude obstruction' is specific to gravity-only, not a fundamental barrier."
  - Mitigation: PA-D1.3a is explicitly a remark on PA-D1.3, the "gravity-only sieve." It doesn't claim the magnitude obstruction is fundamental — only that it explains why d ≥ 6 fails under gravity-only. PA-E2 and PA-E3 handle multi-coupling cases separately in §3.3. No overclaim.
