# C99 Debate: clarify Euler step-doubling witness (explicit \(f'(y)[f(y)]\); show modified equation)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Hard question
Is this clarity polish worth a standalone `C` cycle, or should it only be bundled into a larger promotion wave?

## Current resolution
Proceed because the section is a “worked witness” whose value depends on being instantly readable. The change adds a small but self-contained derivation display (not just a symbol swap), and it addresses a specific reviewer-style readability concern identified in `Q55`.
