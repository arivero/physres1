# C62 Execution: Promote Implementation Note

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5j` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` after D1.5i.
- Promoted a minimal implementation pipeline:
  - observer-frame reconstruction from \(\hat{\mathbf n},\rho,\dot\rho\),
  - source-frame subtraction,
  - projected observables and residual \(\mathcal T_{\mathbf n}\).
- Kept note concise and measurement-agnostic.
