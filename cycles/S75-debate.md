# S75 Debate: Is the semigroup result worth promoting?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
D6.2a + H6.2 already assert an analogy between step-halving and RG. Does making the semigroup law explicit add value?

## Assessment
**Yes**, for two reasons:

1. **From analogy to derivation**: H6.2 calls the rooted-tree/Butcher-group connection an "analogy." The semigroup law τ_b ∘ τ_c = τ_{bc} is not an analogy — it is the same algebraic structure. Stating it converts a heuristic into a verifiable claim.

2. **The continuous beta function is concrete**: β(a) = 1/2 - a is the simplest possible RG flow (linear, one-dimensional, universally attractive). It makes the RG language in Section 8 grounded in a fully explicit computation that readers can verify in one line. This addresses Section 9.4's residual vulnerability #3 ("No full one-loop or higher-loop field-theory computation") at the toy level.

## What should NOT be promoted
- The full b-step induction (routine computation)
- The chain-rule accumulation formula (verification detail)
- The exponential-relaxation solution (follows immediately from β)
