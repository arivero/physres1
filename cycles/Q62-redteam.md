# Q62 Red Team: Referee pass failure modes

Date: 2026-02-12

## Failure modes
- Missing a subtle error in the dimensional analysis:
  - Mitigation: each step was verified independently (YM coupling dimension, conformal weight, form-degree formula). The algebra is elementary.
- Not catching a reader-flow problem:
  - Mitigation: checked that the H4.0x cluster reads as a coherent sidebar and that the transition to D4.1 is clean. Forward references to RG are consistent with existing manuscript practice.
- Overlooking a label collision with companion papers:
  - Mitigation: grep for H4.0c across all `papers/*/main.md` confirmed no collision.
