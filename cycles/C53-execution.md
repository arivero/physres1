# C53 Execution: Promote SR Stability Wave into the Draft

## Work Completed
- Updated `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` by adding a new Section 5 (“SR Stability of Circular Orbits”) that:
  - states the fixed-\(L\) energy function \(W_L(r)\),
  - recovers the SR circularity condition from \(W_L'(r_0)=0\),
  - derives the compact stability criterion \(1+(2-q)\gamma^2>0\),
  - records the Newtonian limit \(q<3\) and the SR speed bound \(v^2/c^2<3-q\) for \(2<q<3\).
- Updated the “Next Waves” list to remove the completed SR-stability item and keep follow-ups scoped (Schwarzschild ISCO, modeling assumptions).
