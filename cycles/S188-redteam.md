# S188 Redteam: Crossing Symmetry

## Issues Resolved
1. **HIGH: Mandelstam assumptions** → Explicitly stated in Section "Mandelstam Analyticity"
2. **MEDIUM: Fermion crossing** → Clarified spinor sign conventions with explicit formula
3. **MEDIUM: t-channel conflation** → Separated kinematic crossing from physical-region crossing
4. **MEDIUM: Froissart relevance** → Dropped from scope (focus on crossing, not soft limits)
5. **MEDIUM: Physical regions** → Defined u, s, t regions for fermionic 2→2 scattering

## Blocking Issues for Promotion
None. All HIGH and MEDIUM issues resolved. Ready for C229.

## Correctness Check
- Physics of Grassmann obstruction vs Mandelstam channels: VERIFIED
- Spinor sign conventions: VERIFIED by reviewer
