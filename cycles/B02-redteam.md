## Failure Modes
1. Adding a “modern” reference that does not actually state the Van Vleck prefactor formula.
2. Citing a non-OA source without marking `PENDING`.
3. Threading the citation in a way that suggests “citation = proof” rather than “anchor/attribution”.

## Mitigations
- Use an OA source that explicitly writes the Van Vleck propagator formula with the determinant prefactor.
- Keep the manuscript derivation self-contained; use the reference as an anchor.
