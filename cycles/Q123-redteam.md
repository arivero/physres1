# Q123 Redteam: Quality Review Validation

## Pass Criteria Met
- [x] Remark 3.2: Physics correct, clarity acceptable, scope relevant
- [x] Remark 5.7: Physics correct, notation defined, no ambiguity

## Referee Findings Validated
1. **Fourier orthogonality**: standard assumption in action-angle theory. Heuristic framing is appropriate.
2. **Notation consistency**: N̂ vs n̂ clearly distinguished (hats = operators). Minor variance non-blocking.

## Blocking Issues
None. Both remarks are publication-ready without revisions.

## Recommendation
Approve C227-C228 for commit to main. Minor stylistic notes from referee are optional improvements.
