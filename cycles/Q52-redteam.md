# Q52 Red Team: What a referee would attack in C95

Date: 2026-02-11

## Likely referee objections
- “Symbols appear before definitions; this is jargon up front.”
  - Mitigation: the reader map is explicitly navigational and now points to Appendix 10.3 for definitions; if needed, remove symbols from the early map while keeping the verbal compatibility labels.
- “Future Work implies missing organization.”
  - Mitigation: current wording frames a consolidated diagram/figure as an optional upgrade (not a missing feature).
