# Q17 Debate: Should We Keep Both Branches in the Main Text?

## Question
Would it be cleaner to keep only one clock choice in the manuscript and move the other to notes?

## Current Resolution
Keep both in the draft:
- D1.5b without D1.5c risks overclaiming;
- D1.5c is short and directly guards interpretation;
- both together sharpen the hypothesis ladder by showing what is robust and what is convention-dependent.
