# DX02 Debate: Is the scalarization-gauge ↔ ordering-ambiguity parallel real or notational?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Probe B found a structural parallel: scalarization gauge freedom (changing the reference half-density sigma_*) and ordering ambiguity (choosing a quantization map Q) both act as "representative choices with controlled freedom." Is this a genuine algebraic connection, or just a notational parallel?

## Current position
The connection is plausible but unproven. The argument would be:
1. A half-density kernel K(x,y) defines an integral operator.
2. Scalarizing K by choosing sigma_* gives a scalar kernel k(x,y), which (via its symbol) defines a quantization prescription.
3. Changing sigma_* changes k(x,y) by a multiplicative factor, which changes the symbol and hence the quantization prescription.
4. The O(hbar) discrepancy between quantization prescriptions (Section 10.2) should correspond to a specific class of sigma_* changes.

Step 4 is the non-trivial claim. It would require showing that sigma_*-rescaling of the kernel corresponds to a specific ordering change at leading order in hbar.

## What would change my mind?
- **Confirms**: a computation in 1D QM showing that two specific sigma_* choices (e.g., flat vs metric-derived) yield quantization maps differing by a known ordering term.
- **Refutes**: a demonstration that sigma_* rescaling acts on the *amplitude* of the kernel (zeroth-order in hbar) rather than on the *phase* (which controls ordering), making it orthogonal to ordering ambiguity.

## Relationship to the North Star
This touches RCP's representation leg (Q_hbar). If scalarization gauge IS ordering ambiguity, then the half-density formalism provides a *geometric* origin for representation compatibility: changing the scalarization gauge is changing the ordering prescription, and RCP's representation compatibility says these must give the same classical limit. This would tighten the argument but not change the principle.
