## Content
Example 5.2: 3D contact interaction with scattering length.
- Scattering amplitude: f₀(k) = -a/(1 + ika)
- Linear divergence (vs logarithmic in d=2) requires renormalization
- Scattering length a is the RG-invariant datum (like μ_* in d=2)
- Bound state at E = -ℏ²/(2ma²) for a > 0

Subagent review (skeptical nuclear physicist):
- Flagged T-matrix sign conventions as CRITICAL. Resolution: avoided T-matrix entirely, used the universally defined scattering amplitude f₀(k) = 1/(-1/a - ik) = -a/(1+ika) which is convention-independent.
- Flagged loop integral coefficients as MODERATE. Resolution: stated renormalization condition schematically (1/g₀ ∝ Λ + finite) rather than with explicit numerical factors.

## Result
Fermionic mediators satellite 122 → 129 lines (+7 net).
