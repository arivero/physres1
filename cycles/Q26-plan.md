# Q26 Plan: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5l

## Goal
Check coherence and claim discipline after adding the nonlinear-validation trigger in D1.5l.

## Checks
1. Read D1.5b-l as one chain.
2. Verify D1.5l remains operational guidance, not a universal law.
3. Confirm uncertainty language is consistent with D1.5k baseline framing.
4. Run guardrail scan on `paper/main.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- No internal contradictions across D1.5b-l.
- No overclaims about universality of thresholds or methods.
- Guardrail scan remains clean.
