# S154 Execution: Anomalies as refinement constraints

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Wrote blackboard 0 on anomalies: chiral anomaly (ABJ), no-go theorems (Nielsen-Ninomiya), universality of anomaly coefficient, 't Hooft matching, anomaly cancellation.
2. Reviewed by particle physicist subagent: anomaly formula correct; anomaly cancellation condition Q_u+Q_d+Q_e+Q_ν=0 WRONG (missing color multiplicity, actual conditions involve cubic charges); π⁰→γγ formula missing N_c factor.
3. Corrections: avoid explicit cancellation formula, describe qualitatively; omit π⁰ rate formula.
