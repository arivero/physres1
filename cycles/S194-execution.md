# S194: Execution — Schwinger model blackboard

**Date:** 2026-02-13

Wrote blackboard 0 on Schwinger model. Reviewed by lattice gauge theorist subagent: 1 HIGH (Schwinger 1962 attribution — not 'exact solution', bosonization from Coleman 1975), 2 MEDIUM (θ-vacuum needs massive fermions, verify E coefficient). All corrections applied before promotion.
