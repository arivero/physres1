# C11 Execution

## Manuscript Deltas
1. Added `Heuristic H6.1` in Section 8 framing renormalization prescriptions as definitional in divergent refinement problems.
2. Renumbered the rooted-tree bookkeeping note as `Heuristic H6.2`.
3. Added `Derivation D6.3` presenting the difference quotient as a counterterm subtraction micro-model.

## Follow-up Draft
1. Added `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` as a dependent follow-up draft focused on RG fundamentality.

## Sections Touched
1. `paper/main.md`.
2. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`.

## Acceptance Test Results
1. Added labeled heuristic + derivation in Section 8: passed.
2. Follow-up draft created: passed.
3. Manuscript policy check: run separately as part of repo-wide checks.
