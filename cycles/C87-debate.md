# C87 Debate: How strong should the claim be?

Date: 2026-02-10

## Question
What is the strongest referee-safe claim about “fermionic mediators generating a potential” that we can responsibly promote?

## Decision
State the limited but precise claim:
“Linear sourcing of a fermion field requires Grassmann sources, so the standard ‘commuting classical charge density \(\Rightarrow\) classical potential’ derivation does not transplant to fermionic mediators; the robust IR replacement is EFT/contact (diagonal-support) data and/or loop/composite mechanisms.”

## Rationale
This avoids false “uncertainty sets range” narratives, stays compatible with known effective mechanisms, and connects directly to the repo’s existing contact/RG witnesses.
