# D17 Debate: Does the threshold bridge duplicate satellite content?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
If the relativistic satellite already discusses critical exponents, does adding \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\) in the main paper just duplicate content?

## Resolution
It adds value as a one-paragraph bridge because the main paper needs a compact unifying statement that links Newtonian and SR threshold shifts while explicitly marking the distinct \(q=2\) dimensional mechanism.
