# B06 Plan: Reference for "No Lebesgue Measure" Obstruction

## Goal
Attach at least one reasonably standard, OA-accessible reference supporting the heuristic statement in `paper/main.md`:
there is no Lebesgue/Haar-type translation-invariant measure on infinite-dimensional path space (so `Dq` is formal).

## Tasks
1. Find an OA-accessible reference that explicitly states the theorem-level fact (with correct hypotheses).
2. Add a bibliography ledger entry in `paper/bibliography.md` (DOI/arXiv and OA note).
3. Update `docs/research-log.md` and `cycles/index.md`.

## Acceptance Tests
- New key is `[AuthorYearShortTag]` format and includes DOI/arXiv when available.
- OA status is recorded (or marked `PENDING` if no OA route).
- No manuscript text is changed in this cycle (citation insertion can be a follow-up `C`).
