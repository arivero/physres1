# Q72 Debate: Is the three-mechanism classification exhaustive?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
PA-D1.3a classifies failures as parity (odd d), magnitude (even d ≥ 6), or degenerate (d = 2). Is d = 0 or d = 1 a missing case?

## Recommendation
No. Physical spacetime has d ≥ 2 (at minimum 1 time + 1 space dimension for dynamics). d = 0 and d = 1 are not physically meaningful spacetime dimensions for the gravitational sieve. PA-D1.3 implicitly assumes d ≥ 2 by using the Einstein–Hilbert action. The classification is exhaustive for d ≥ 2.
