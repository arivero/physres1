# C86 Plan: Concrete \(G\) Witness via Half-Density Scalarization Scale in \(D=4\)

## Goal
Add a short, concrete witness in `paper/main.md` that makes the \(G\) role less slogan-like:
in a spacetime \(D=4\) half-density scalarization context, the required universal scale is an area, and \(\hbar,c,G\) supply the Planck area \(\ell_P^2=\hbar G/c^3\).

## Target
Tighten `Heuristic H4.0a` by adding one sentence:
- explicitly mention the \(D=4\) area dimension in QFT/spacetime half-density settings,
- identify Planck area as the natural universal candidate,
- keep this as a bounded remark (no new claims about gravity dynamics).

## Acceptance
1. Manuscript edit is small, scoped, and does not overclaim.
2. `cycles/C86-execution.md` records manuscript diffstat via `scripts/paper-diffstat.sh --cached`.
3. Commit and push.
