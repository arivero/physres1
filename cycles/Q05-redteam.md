## Failure Modes
1. The \(\delta(f')\) vs \(\delta'\) distinction is still easy to miss or reads as notation policing rather than conceptual necessity.
2. The weak Euler–Lagrange paragraph suggests that \(\delta'\) is the generic “corner term”, when in many cases corners produce \(\delta\)-type contributions (and \(\delta'\) appears only at higher distributional order).
3. The draft drifts into functional-integral “\(\delta(\delta S)\)” language without clear caveats (the Outlook already flags this, but keep it contained).

## Mitigations
- If needed, soften the corner/jump phrasing to “derivatives of delta kernels (including \(\delta\) and possibly \(\delta'\))”.
- Keep the weak Euler–Lagrange remark to a few lines and explicitly state the regularity/boundary-term assumption.
- Keep functional-integral statements in Outlook labeled heuristic.
