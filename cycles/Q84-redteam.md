## Failure modes

### 1. Premature Tier 1
- Risk: promoting too quickly after just one encoding pass + one bibliography pass.
- Mitigation: Q83 was a thorough initial pass (math, notation, citations, encoding, structure). C129 + B19 addressed all findings. Q84 verified each fix. The two-pass structure (Q83 → fix → Q84) is sufficient for this short note.
