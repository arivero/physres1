# S148 Plan: Casimir effect as force from boundary conditions

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study the Casimir effect as a macroscopic force arising purely from boundary conditions (no classical source), for promotion into fermionic mediators satellite Section 5.

## Steps
1. Write blackboard 1: Casimir effect — conducting plates, vacuum mode restriction, F/A formula, regularization scheme independence, experimental verification.
2. Launch reviewer subagent (QFT vacuum effects expert persona).
3. Incorporate corrections and promote to Remark 5.7 in fermionic mediators paper.
