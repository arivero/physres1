# S276 Debate: Is generalized A(L) still useful for manuscript-level messaging?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Current question
Will this branch stay compact enough to support a future one-sentence caveat, or will it remain note-only?

## Current stance
Compact condition exists: unique-threshold framing is safe only with monotone \(A(L)\). This is likely note-level unless a future C-cycle needs one short caveat sentence.

## Iteration 2 addendum
The compact condition is now sharper: monotonicity + range coverage, not monotonicity alone.

## Iteration 3 addendum
The branch now has a compact manuscript-safe caveat: uniqueness should be claimed on the operating `L` window, not necessarily globally.
