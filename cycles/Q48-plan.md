# Q48 Plan: Referee Pass on RCP Operationalization (C90)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C90`: operational closure form for RCP + minor submission-hygiene edits in `paper/main.md`

## Goal
Referee-pass `C90` for clarity, notation hygiene, and foundations-journal reader experience: the new RCP block should be operational (not tautological) and should not introduce confusing notation drift.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q48-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Notation: \(\mathcal C,\mathcal Q,\mathcal R\) symbols match earlier usage; new indices (\(h,b,\alpha\)) are defined.
- Claim hygiene: closure statement explicitly includes “there exists \(\theta'\)” idea; avoids becoming a tautology.
- Reader flow: the new block reads as a clarification of P10.1, not as a new abstract detour.
- Hygiene edits: no loss of essential context from removing internal path references.

## Acceptance criteria
- Concrete follow-ups expressed as spawned `C/S/B/D` cycles (no direct edits).
