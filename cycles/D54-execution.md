# D54 Execution: QFT extension of composition argument

Date: 2026-02-14

## Summary
The composition-forces-quantization argument (D49-D53) extends to QFT via mode
decomposition. Each field mode is a QM system; P4.2 applies per-mode. The new
QFT ingredient is infinite-mode assembly, controlled by A4 (RG/scale invariance).

Clean two-layer separation:
- **Layer 1 (Quantization)**: A1 forces ℏ, d/2, Gaussian weight per mode
- **Layer 2 (Renormalization)**: A4 assembles modes, tames UV divergences

The functional determinant det'(-Δ+m²)^{1/2} is the infinite-d analog of the
d/2 normalization factor. UV divergences arise from assembling infinitely many
individually-well-behaved modes, not from any per-mode failure.

## Novelty assessment
MODERATE (synthesis). Mode decomposition is standard; the two-layer axiom picture
connecting to P4.2 reduction is the novel contribution.

## Deliverables
D54-discovery.md filed. No notebook update needed (self-contained observation).
Potential C-cycle promotion target: rcp-foundations Section 7 (two-layer table).
