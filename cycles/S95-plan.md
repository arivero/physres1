# S95 Plan: Fermionic mediators paper expansion assessment
Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
The fermionic mediators paper (95 lines) is now the thinnest Tier 1 satellite. Assess whether it can be expanded with a concrete loop-induced example, making the "fermions affect forces through loops" claim (line 54-55) explicit.

## Candidate additions
1. Vacuum polarization: fermion loop → effective charge screening → modified Coulomb.
2. Four-fermion operator: Fermi theory from integrating out W boson (not a fermion loop per se, but a contact-interaction example).
3. Neutrino exchange: toy model where fermion exchange generates an effective potential through box diagrams (but this is complex and controversial).

## Assessment criteria
- Does it stay within the paper's bounded scope?
- Can it be done in ~10–15 lines?
- Is it standard enough to be referee-safe?
