# B10 Execution: OA Anchor for Central Potentials (\(e^{im\phi}\) factor)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Work performed
- Acquired an OA lecture-note anchor for angular momentum / spherical harmonics and ingested it into `sources/` (gitignored by policy).
- Fetch target used: `http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qm/qm.pdf`
  - (Note: `http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/quantum/quantum.pdf` was not available in this environment.)
- Local capture: `sources/qm-6a8ebd24.md` (converted from PDF at `2026-02-11 00:02:32Z`).

## Keys updated
- `[TongQMLectures]`: added (OA lecture notes; used to anchor the \(e^{im\phi}\) azimuthal factor).

## Artifacts produced
- `paper/bibliography.md`: updated
- `sources/qm-6a8ebd24.md`: ingested (gitignored by policy)

## Notes for promotion
- Intended citation point (future `C89`):
  - support the statement “central-potential angular dependence contains \(e^{im\phi}\)”.
