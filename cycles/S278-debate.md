# S278 Debate: Should drift diagnostics stay entirely in notes?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Current question
Is any potential-drift diagnostic short enough for manuscript use, or should it remain supporting material only?

## Current stance
A one-line diagnostic and one-line caution sentence now exist; detailed sweeps remain note-level.

## Iteration 2 addendum
Alternative correction-family test suggests the drift-diagnostic framing is portable, which increases confidence that a short caution sentence can survive model variation.

## Iteration 3 addendum
A finite-window max-drift gate converts the caution sentence from qualitative warning into a checkable condition.
