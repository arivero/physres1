# C73 Execution: Create Dependent Note on "Uncuttable = Controlled Refinement"

## Work Completed
- Created `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md`.
- Promoted:
  - a precise definition of "uncuttable" as a controlled-refinement notion (not indivisibility),
  - a toy refinement example (Riemann sums/integrals),
  - a bridge to the cornerstone manuscript's H0.2 obstruction list.
