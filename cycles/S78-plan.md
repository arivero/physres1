# S78 Plan: Van Vleck prefactor × transmutation scale in 2D delta

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Determine how the transmutation scale κ* interacts with the Van Vleck half-density prefactor in the 2D delta model. This addresses Planck-area draft open problem #2 (Section 7): "Show how the area scale enters stationary-phase prefactors and how this interacts with RG scaling."

## Question
In the 2D delta model (Section 10.5), the free propagator has a Van Vleck-type half-density prefactor (PA-D1.4). At finite coupling, the full interacting kernel acquires a T-matrix factor containing the transmutation scale κ*. Does κ* modify the half-density transformation law, or does it enter only the scalar amplitude?

## Method
1. Write the free kernel in d = 2 and identify the Van Vleck half-density factor.
2. Write the full interacting kernel via Lippmann–Schwinger (resolvent form).
3. Analyze the factorization structure: which factors carry half-density weight, which are scalars.
4. Determine where κ* enters and how it relates to the scalarization hypothesis ladder (PA-H2.1–H2.5).

## Expected output
- Blackboard note with the analysis.
- Structural conclusion about half-density (geometric) vs transmutation (dynamical) separation.
