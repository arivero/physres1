# Q171 Redteam

Date: 2026-02-14

## Failure modes
1. Readers may miss that \(\nu\) is asymptotic degree, not exact dispersion exponent at all scales.
2. Future edits could remove the caveat and reintroduce mechanism conflation.

## Mitigations
1. Keep "high-momentum asymptotic" phrase in the remark.
2. Add this check to future Q passes touching Section 3.
