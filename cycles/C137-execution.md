# C137 Execution: Expand action-angle paper with harmonic oscillator example
Date: 2026-02-13

## Changes
Added new Section 6 ("A second witness: the harmonic oscillator") with Example 6.1:
- Fock states as action eigenstates with uniformly delocalized orbit phase (Husimi ring).
- Coherent state formula with Poisson-distributed Fock weights.
- Explicit tradeoff: localizing phase Δθ ~ 1/|α| requires spreading action Δn ~ |α|.
- Cross-reference back to Section 4's Fourier tradeoff.

Outlook renumbered to Section 7 (updated to reference harmonic oscillator).

Paper: 74 → 87 lines (+13 net).
