# C65 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Symbol clutter:** adding \(\chi\) and \(\epsilon_{\rm nl}\) overcomplicates D1.5 flow.
2. **False universality:** readers still infer a universal calibration curve.
3. **Inference mismatch:** covariance blocks depend on reconstruction choices not stated in the manuscript.

## Mitigations
1. Keep formulas minimal and local to one remark.
2. State explicitly that calibration is instrument/model specific.
3. Tie \(\Sigma_r,\Sigma_v\) to the declared reconstruction model from D1.5i/j.
