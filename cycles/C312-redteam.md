## Failure modes
1. **Overstatement risk**: "effective hypothesis count ~3" could be misread as "only 3 hypotheses" when strictly (L_loc) is derivable from (D) only for a specific class. Mitigation: P4.2d explicitly states "any kernel satisfying (C)+(I)+(D) with dimensional constants {m, hbar} must be Gaussian."

2. **Extension claims too broad**: P4.2e claims extensions to curved/interacting/Lorentzian without full proofs in the manuscript. Mitigation: each point cites the specific witness (Van Vleck, Mehler, Fresnel) and uses "confirms" rather than "proves."

3. **Energy-shift estimate in D9.1a correction**: giving specific meV numbers may age poorly or be model-dependent. Mitigation: framed as "for GaAs quantum wells" with order-of-magnitude language (~0.01-0.06 meV).

4. **Kappa universality (P4.2f)**: "transitivity of interaction" is informal. Mitigation: restricted to "any connected physics" and "under the single-exponential-weight assumption."

## Overall assessment
The promotions are well-scoped and the mathematical claims are explicit and checkable. The main risk is readers wanting full proofs rather than witness-level arguments, but this is appropriate for a Physics Reports survey paper.
