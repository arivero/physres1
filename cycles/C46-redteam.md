# C46 Redteam: Failure Modes and Mitigations

## Failure Modes
1. **Scope creep:** the Planck-area draft starts looking like a “why 4D” manifesto.
2. **Overclaim:** readers infer we derived \(D=4\) from half-densities alone.
3. **Technical confusion:** mixing conformal-metric computations with coupling-dimension sieves blurs the hypothesis ladder.

## Mitigations
1. Keep it short (one formula + one paragraph) and explicitly label “within the conformal ansatz”.
2. State plainly: half-densities alone do not select a dimension; special dimensions appear only after extra selection criteria (H2.4–H2.5 or operator-simplicity criteria).
3. Place it under a heading like “Independent filter” and explicitly contrast it with H2.5.
