# Q42 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **"Canonical" misread**: readers think \(\tau_b\) is uniquely defined by Nature rather than by a comparison rule.
2. **Cutoff confusion**: switching between \(\Lambda\) and \(h\) reads like switching theories.
3. **Jargon compression**: "counterterms/effective operators" lands too fast for foundations readers.

## Mitigations
1. Avoid uniqueness language; make "chosen comparison rule" explicit.
2. Keep the \(\Lambda\leftrightarrow h\) relation as an example, not an identity.
3. Keep at least one concrete computation (step-halving, difference quotient) attached nearby.
