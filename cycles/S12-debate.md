# S12 Debate

## Question
Should we include the 1D case at the “simple delta potential” level (finite integral), or only at the “full contact family / self-adjoint extensions” level (nontrivial RG flow)?

## Working Resolution
Record both as separate bullets:
- 1D simple \(\delta(x)\) has no UV divergence in \(I_1\),
- the full 1D contact family has a nontrivial RG flow (leave details for a later study/promotion pass).
