# D28 Red Team: Polygonal Convergence Statement

Date: 2026-02-14

## Failure modes
- Overpromising convergence in the presence of singular potentials / near-collisions.
- Producing a statement that depends on heavy machinery and is not promotable.
- Confusing “symplectic” (structure-preserving) with “higher order accurate”.

## Mitigations
- Keep hypotheses explicit and minimal (finite time interval, away from \(r=0\), Lipschitz force).
- Provide one explicit failure mode where hypotheses fail (so the hedging is justified).
- Emphasize that symplectic Euler is first-order but preserves invariants (e.g. angular momentum) exactly in the central case.
