# Q43 Plan: Referee Pass on the New \(\hbar\) Witness (`Derivation D4.2a`)

## Goal
Quality-pass the newly added `Derivation D4.2a` in `paper/main.md` for:
- clarity (finite-dimensional witness, not a measure claim),
- novelty (refinement-composition framing, not textbook summary),
- claim hygiene (stationary vs minimum, Euclidean vs real time).

## Checks
1. Read the local flow around Section 6.4 (`Derivation D4.2`--`D4.3`).
2. Verify the text does not conflate "stationary" with "minimum" outside the explicitly Euclideanized witness.
3. Make minimal edits if wording invites a wrong reading.

## Acceptance
- No edits required, or only small wording fixes.
