# C51 Execution: Relativistic-Central-Orbits Draft Seed

## Work Completed
- Added `papers/relativistic-central-orbits/main.md` with:
  - SR circular-orbit derivation for \(F=K/r^q\),
  - inverse-square \(q=2\) special case \(v=K/L\) and bound \(L>K/c\),
  - a short roadmap for stability and GR extensions.
