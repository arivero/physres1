# C43 Debate

## Question
Should BV be removed entirely from the repo’s drafts, or kept as a strictly non-blocking outlook note?

## Working Resolution
Keep BV only as a one-paragraph outlook theme when it helps orient readers, but do not allocate dedicated cycles (especially bibliography cycles) to BV unless explicitly requested later.
