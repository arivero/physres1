# B00 Plan

## Goal
Add at least one **independent, non-preprint** anchor for point/contact interactions (1D U(2) family) and, if feasible, one additional anchor for delta-function renormalization beyond our current `ManuelTarrach1994PertRenQM` reference.

## Scope
1. Use INSPIRE/arXiv metadata (OA-first) to identify candidates for:
   - point interactions / self-adjoint extensions on the line,
   - \(\delta\), \(\delta'\) and related contact models,
   - (optional) delta-function renormalization notes (2D/3D).
2. Add new citation keys to `paper/bibliography.md` with stable identifiers (arXiv/DOI/ISBN as available).
3. Ingest what is legally OA into `sources/` (otherwise create `sources/pending-<Key>.md` with next actions).

## Acceptance Tests
1. `paper/bibliography.md` gains ≥2 new keys relevant to the 1D/2D/3D contact interaction discussion.
2. At least one of:
   - new OA capture in `sources/`, or
   - new `sources/pending-<Key>.md` entry with attempted URLs recorded.
