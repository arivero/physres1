# C60 Plan: Promote Non-Planar Cautionary Note

## Goal
Promote S33 into the manuscript as a concise non-planar caution near D1.5g.

## Scope
- Add one short remark emphasizing vector-area formulation in 3D.
- Keep result branch-scoped and operational.

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript contains explicit vector identities and scalar projection caveat.
- `cycles/C60-execution.md` includes manuscript diffstat output.
