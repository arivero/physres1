# C138 Debate

## Hard question
Should the mixed vs full Hessian distinction be developed further?
## Resolution
No — the paper is about delta objects and their half-density weights, not about the Van Vleck determinant per se. The distinction is noted; a full treatment of the mixed-Hessian geometry (Jacobi fields, conjugate points) would belong in a separate paper.
