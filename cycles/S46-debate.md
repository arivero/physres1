# S46 Debate: Put "Uncuttable" in the Main Paper?

## Question
Should the "uncuttable" definition be inserted into `paper/main.md` directly, or kept in a dependent note?

## Current Resolution
Keep it in a dependent note. The core manuscript can retain the general "limit control" framing without importing historical/interpretive terminology.
