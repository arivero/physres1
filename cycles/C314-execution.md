# C314 Execution: Continuum-time forcing from dimensional homogeneity

Date: 2026-02-14

## What was promoted
- **Remark P4.2g** in `paper/main.md` Section 10 (after P4.2f, before Section 6.2)
- Source: D40/S296 (blackboard slot 0)
- Content: dimensional obstruction to discrete time → continuum forced

## Core result
Non-relativistic QM basis {m, ℏ} cannot produce time scale ε:
- [ε] = T requires b=0 (from length matching) and b=−1 (from time matching)
- Contradiction → no discrete-time formulation compatible with (D)
- Impact: P4.2 forces BOTH ℏ (action scale) AND continuous t (time parameter)
