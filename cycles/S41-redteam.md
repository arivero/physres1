# S41 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Transcript overuse:** mapping becomes a proxy for citing `conv_patched.md`.
2. **Overpromising:** treating underrepresented themes as already established results.
3. **Priority thrash:** switching promotion targets every cycle without consolidating.

## Mitigations
1. Use `conv_patched.md` only as an idea log; promote only results supported by our own derivations or independent sources.
2. Keep new promotions explicitly heuristic when not anchored.
3. Select one promotion target per `C` cycle and complete it end-to-end.
