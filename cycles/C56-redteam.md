# C56 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Notation overload:** readers lose track of the main Planck-area thread.
2. **Implicit assumptions:** source 4-velocity dependence is not stated clearly.
3. **False closure:** remark interpreted as settling the clock issue definitively.

## Mitigations
1. Keep remark short and place after D1.5c as optional refinement.
2. Explicitly say “relative to source 4-velocity”.
3. End with “candidate/outlook” wording and no universal claim.
