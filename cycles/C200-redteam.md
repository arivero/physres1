# C200 Red Team: Promote anomalous magnetic moment

Date: 2026-02-13

## Risks
- Schwinger pair production date (1951) carefully not conflated with g-2 paper (1948).
- Higher-order coefficients avoided to prevent disputed values.
- Muon g-2 stated as sensitivity to heavy physics, without claiming a discrepancy (status evolving).
- Remark numbering shift: old 3.3 → 3.4. No internal cross-references broken.
