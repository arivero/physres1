# S274 Debate: Is L_crit too model-specific for general messaging?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does introducing \(L_{\mathrm{crit}}\) overfit to a particular coefficient model and reduce portability?

## Resolution
It is acceptable in notes as a compact parametric witness. Promotion to manuscript should remain optional and sentence-level only.
