## Failure modes
1. The coherent-state formula is textbook but a referee might want a citation. The existing [Sakurai2020] reference covers coherent states (Ch. 2 in 3rd ed.), so this is already anchored.
2. The Δθ ~ 1/|α| and Δn ~ |α| scalings are heuristic (they follow from Poisson statistics but aren't stated as rigorous bounds). Acceptable for a "witness" paper; the paper explicitly avoids claiming formal uncertainty inequalities.
