# C244 — Execution

## Changes
1. Updated HD-D1.3a last paragraph: clarified that the detailed cancellation
   pattern is conformal-class-specific, but the leading-order coefficient is
   universal. Transitional sentence added.

2. Added Remark HD-D1.3b (~7 lines of prose + 1 displayed equation):
   - Normal-coordinate derivation: V(p) = (1/6)R for all D, all metrics.
   - Matching with conformal coupling: ξ_conf = 1/6 iff D=4.
   - Physical interpretation: curvature potential cancels at leading order
     in D=4 for conformally coupled half-density field.
   - Connection to Seeley-DeWitt a₁ coefficient.
   - Uses "matching" language per reviewer guidance (not "selection").
