# S44 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Sign/convention mismatch:** confusion about whether \(E,L\) are per unit mass and about \(G=c=1\) conventions.
2. **Scope creep into full GR:** too much GR material in a refinement-witness note.
3. **Citation expectations:** readers want references beyond the internal derivation.

## Mitigations
1. Keep conventions explicit and match existing Section 4 notation.
2. Keep to effective potential derivation only.
3. Leave the existing baseline anchor citation as-is; this insertion is derivation-first.
