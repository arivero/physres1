# C73 Plan: Create Dependent Note on "Uncuttable = Controlled Refinement"

## Goal
Promote the S46 definition into a new dependent draft note without importing historical claims into the cornerstone manuscript.

## Scope
- Create `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md` with:
  - a precise definition of "uncuttable" as a controlled-refinement notion,
  - one toy example (Riemann sums / integrals),
  - a short bridge to `paper/main.md` (action refinements, H0.2 failure modes).

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript content is substantive (not just a stub).
- No cycle tags appear in draft content.
- `cycles/C73-execution.md` logs manuscript diffstat.
