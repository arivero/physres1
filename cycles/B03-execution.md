# B03 Execution: OA Anchors for Green Scaling and Minimal Length

## Changes
1. `paper/bibliography.md`
   - Added `[Tanaka2021KernelQuadrature]` (arXiv:`2102.10887`) as an OA anchor explicitly stating the \(d\)-dimensional fundamental solution \(G_d\) for the Laplacian on \(\mathbb R^d\) (including the \(d=2\) logarithmic case).
   - Added `[Hossenfelder2013MinimalLength]` (Living Rev. Rel. 2013; arXiv:`1203.6191`; DOI `10.12942/lrr-2013-2`) as an OA review entry point for minimal-length / GUP scenarios.
2. `sources/` (untracked by repo policy)
   - Ingested the arXiv PDFs into:
     - `sources/2102-10887v2-b370c928.md`
     - `sources/1203-6191v2-95175764.md`
3. `papers/planck-area/main.md`
   - Added citation `[Tanaka2021KernelQuadrature]` to the dimension-link sentence in `Remark D1.5a`.
   - Added an “Open problems” pointer to `[Hossenfelder2013MinimalLength]` as a tracked comparison branch (no claims imported).
4. `docs/research-log.md` / `cycles/index.md`
   - Recorded the cycle and refreshed next steps.
