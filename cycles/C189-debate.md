# C189 Debate: Casimir effect promotion

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Casimir effect is the boundary-condition paradigm of Section 5 producing an actual measurable force.
- Natural placement after the Feshbach resonance remark (both are experimental realizations of the theoretical framework).
- Regularization scheme independence is a strong thematic connection to the paper's refinement narrative.
