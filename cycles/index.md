**Page counts** (elsarticle 3p twocolumn = PLB format; run `scripts/count-pages.sh`):
- PLB-length (≤6pp): HD-QFT 4pp (234 lines), delta 4pp (188), dirac 4pp (196), relativistic 4pp (233).
- PRD-length (>6pp): action-angle 13pp, fermionic 13pp, uncuttable 13pp, rg-fund 9pp, planck-area 14pp.
- Cornerstone: 23pp (Physics Reports target).

**Recent completed:**
- S204+C244+Q130: V=(1/6)R general-metric matching → Remark HD-D1.3b in HD-QFT (+7 lines).
  Open question #1 partially addressed: D=4 matching is general-metric, not conformal-class-specific.
- S205+C245: SR orbit precession → Remark 3.2 in relativistic orbits (+15 lines).
  Precession = (1/6)×GR, ω = 1/γ_circ.

**Immediate:**
- Q cycle on C245 (relativistic orbits Remark 3.2).
- Below PLB limit, room for expansion: delta (4pp, 188), dirac (4pp, 196).
- Open questions 2–5 from `docs/motivations.md`.

**Standing priorities:**
- Open questions from `docs/motivations.md` have priority over expansion.
- P cycles for satellite submissions when ready.
- Future satellites: item C (Ordering), D (Rooted Trees), A (RCP).

**Deprioritized:**
- `[Landsman1998]`: PENDING_LIBRARY — requires institutional Springer access or physical library visit.
