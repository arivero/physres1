**Page counts** (elsarticle 3p twocolumn = PLB format; run `scripts/count-pages.sh`):
- PLB-length (≤6pp): relativistic 5pp (265), HD-QFT 6pp (265), delta 6pp (218).
- PRD-length (>6pp): dirac 7pp (256), rg-fund 9pp, action-angle 13pp, fermionic 13pp, uncuttable 13pp, planck-area 14pp.
- Cornerstone: 23pp (Physics Reports target).
- **Total corpus: ~125k tokens (Claude tokenizer).**

**Recent completed:**
- S256+C281+Q165: relativistic Remark 5.2c (stability–precession duality γ²ω²=1 at q=2) (+3, 265→268 at time of C281). Q165 PASS.
- S250–S253: Green's function / HJ viscosity / Sobolev regularity / broken geodesics — all NOT promoted (dirac at 7pp, over PLB limit).
- S246+C280+Q164: dirac-probes Remark 5.2a (self-adjoint extension = quantum impulse) (+3, 256). Q164 PASS.

**Immediate:**
- Dirac-probes at 7pp — FROZEN for PLB. Would need line cuts to return to ≤6pp.
- Room for PLB expansion: relativistic only (265/5pp). HD-QFT at 6pp boundary.
- Delta-objects at PLB limit — frozen.
- Bibliography: Lanczos, Fraser-Nakane, Delaunay, Nauenberg2003 source ingestion.
- AGENTS.md updated: docs/motivations.md is agent-editable.

**Standing priorities:**
- Open questions from `docs/motivations.md` all analyzed. Focus shifts to expansion.
- P cycles for satellite submissions when ready.
- Future satellites: item C (Ordering), D (Rooted Trees), A (RCP).

**Deprioritized:**
- `[Landsman1998]`: PENDING_LIBRARY — requires institutional Springer access or physical library visit.
