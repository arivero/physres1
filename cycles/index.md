## Next Action
Priority: half-densities + dependent follow-up drafts.
1. Optional `C32`: add a one-sentence pointer near `Derivation D4.3` to `paper/notes/van-vleck-schur-complement.md` now that `B02` is anchored (referee-friendliness).
2. Optional `S09`: study whether the contact-interaction rank-one kernel \(g|0\rangle\langle0|\) admits a clean half-density scalarization narrative parallel to the identity-kernel discussion (keep geometry vs RG separate).
3. Next `B` (when DNS works): expand semiclassical anchor set (book-level references) if desired; low priority now that `B02` is in place.

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
