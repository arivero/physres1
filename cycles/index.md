## Next Action
Priority: half-densities + dependent follow-up drafts.
1. `B02` (blocked until DNS/network works): add a modern semiclassical-propagator reference supporting the Van Vleck prefactor formula (OA-first; otherwise mark `PENDING`).
2. `S08`: multi-dimensional version \(\delta(\nabla f)\) and the Van Vleck determinant as the Hessian weight (then decide if a longer `paper/notes/` addendum is warranted).
3. Optional `Q03`: quick check that Section 5.5 remains concise after D3.5a.

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
