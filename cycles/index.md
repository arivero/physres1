## Next Action
Priority: half-densities + dependent follow-up drafts.
1. `C28`: promote `S06` into `papers/planck-area/main.md` (make the “admissible couplings” knob explicit; clarify H2.5a vs H2.5b invariance).
2. `B02` (when network is available): add a modern semiclassical-propagator reference supporting the Van Vleck prefactor formula (OA-first; otherwise mark `PENDING`).
3. Optional `Q02`: quick quality pass on the Planck-area + RG notes after the recent delta/identity-kernel additions (notation + redundancy check).

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
