**Page counts** (elsarticle 3p twocolumn = PLB format; run `scripts/count-pages.sh`):
- PLB-length (≤6pp): HD-QFT 4pp (234 lines), delta 4pp (194), dirac 4pp (199), relativistic 4pp (233).
- PRD-length (>6pp): action-angle 13pp, fermionic 13pp, uncuttable 13pp, rg-fund 9pp, planck-area 14pp.
- Cornerstone: 23pp (Physics Reports target).

**Recent completed:**
- S212+C248: d/2 unifying thread → Remark 5.1 in delta-objects (+3 lines, 194).
- S210: open Q#5 (anomalies + RCP) — conceptual reframing only, no new constraints.
- S211: open Q#2 (minimal RCP axioms) — formalization gap identified, multi-year program.
- Q132: referee review of C246 — PASS. Q133: review of C247 — CONDITIONAL PASS (prefactor fix applied).
- S209+C247: heat kernel exponent → Remark 4.3 in delta-objects.
- S206+C246: mollifier–polygon → Remark 2.3 in dirac-probes.

**Immediate:**
- All 5 open questions from `docs/motivations.md` now analyzed (Q1-Q4 partially resolved, Q5 reframed).
- Q cycle on C248 (delta-objects Remark 5.1).
- Room for further PLB expansion: delta (194), dirac (199).

**Standing priorities:**
- Open questions from `docs/motivations.md` have priority over expansion.
- P cycles for satellite submissions when ready.
- Future satellites: item C (Ordering), D (Rooted Trees), A (RCP).

**Deprioritized:**
- `[Landsman1998]`: PENDING_LIBRARY — requires institutional Springer access or physical library visit.
