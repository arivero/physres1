## Next Action
Priority: half-densities + dependent follow-up drafts.
1. Execute `C21`: tighten the “half-density \(\Rightarrow\) universal \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scale” ladder, and make the \(d=4\) area specialization explicit without overclaiming.
2. Run `B00`: add at least one independent, non-preprint anchor for point interactions (Albeverio/Kurasov lineage) and capture OA sources when possible.
3. Use `S00` blackboard work to keep exploration free, then promote only the stable pieces into `papers/planck-area/main.md`.

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
