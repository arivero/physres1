## Next Action
Priority: complete the queued promotion/referee chain (`C → Q`) while keeping bibliography follow-ups time-capped.
1. `C100`: promote unified notation (and the next-term remark from `S68`) into the step-halving witnesses in `paper/main.md` and `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`.
2. `Q57`: referee pass on `C100` (claim hygiene + notation consistency).

Optional (time-capped):
- `B12`: one more OA attempt for `[Dirac1933]`; otherwise keep `PENDING_LOCAL_PDF`.

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
