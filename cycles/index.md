## Next Action
Priority: half-densities + dependent follow-up drafts.
1. Start `C22`: implement the Q00 actionable fixes that tighten the half-density \(\Rightarrow\) scale/area story and reduce ambiguity (notation, minimal-claim statements, and cross-paper pointers).
2. Start `B01`: locate/capture an OA-stable source for `[Jackiw1991DeltaPotentials]` and add one standard half-density / semiclassical-propagator anchor (`PENDING` if needed).
3. Start `S01`: blackboard the “H2.5 split” (integrality vs perturbative analyticity vs transmutation) and map which statements survive each branch.

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
