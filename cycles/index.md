## Next Action

**Page counts** (elsarticle 3p twocolumn = PLB format; run `scripts/count-pages.sh`):
- PLB-length (≤6pp): relativistic 6pp (296), HD-QFT 6pp (265), delta 6pp (218).
- PRD-length (>6pp): dirac 7pp (256), rg-fund 9pp, action-angle 13pp, fermionic 13pp, uncuttable 13pp, planck-area 14pp.
- Cornerstone: 23pp (Physics Reports target).
- **Total corpus: ~125k tokens (Claude tokenizer).**

**Recent completed:**
- S274+S275(iter4)+D20: threshold-bridge deepening continued without new C-cycle. Added \(L_{\mathrm{crit}}\) marginal map, ran same-ID caveat-coverage + compactness/readability iterations for compression candidates, and deferred C300 (no correctness defect).
- D18+S272+S273+D19: slowed the central-force threshold thread into stress-test cadence (coefficient-aware marginal analysis + assumption-break tests + evidence-gated `S274/S275 -> optional C300` queue).
- D17+S270+S271+C299+Q182: main-paper Section 3.3 bridge wave on `paper/main.md`. Added `Remark P1.1a` (asymptotic threshold \(q_{\mathrm{crit}}=\nu+1\), Newton \(3\) vs SR \(2\), explicit scope split from inverse-square dimensional identity); Q182 PASS.
- C298+Q181: readability pointer hardening on `paper/main.md` (Section 9.5 quick map + `D10.4a`); Q181 PASS.
- C297+Q180: RCP cross-link hardening on `paper/main.md` (`D10.1b` linking domain-data witness to operational closure map); Q180 PASS.
- C296+Q179: Package B deeper extension witness on `paper/main.md` (`D9.1f`, `D9.1g`); Q179 PASS.
- C295+Q178: Package A sanity-limit hardening on `paper/main.md` (`D12.3b`); Q178 PASS.
- C294+Q177: Package A exact nontrivial kernel benchmark on `paper/main.md` (`D12.3`, `D12.3a`); Q177 PASS.
- C293+Q176: main-paper Package A quantitative hardening on `paper/main.md`. Added `P12.2` bounded-potential remainder/composition-defect control; Q176 PASS.
- C291+Q174+C292+Q175: YOLO main-paper continuation on `paper/main.md`. Extended Package B to curved-manifold operator-domain witness (`D9.1d`, `D9.1e`) and Package A to first-order bounded-potential composition witness (`D12.2`, `D12.2a`). Q174/Q175 PASS.
- C289+Q172+C290+Q173: main-paper hardening wave on `paper/main.md`. Added Package C/D/A/E starter derivations (D6.4, D8.2a, D12.1/P12.1, compatibility map), then closed Package B starter with explicit `S^1` domain/symmetry witness (D9.1b, D9.1c). Q172/Q173 PASS.
- C288: converted Section 9 closing prose into task-driven Package A-E queue (`+27 -8`).

**Immediate:**
- Pick one open `S` branch (`S276`/`S277`/`S278`) to deepen next; keep others parked as ready alternatives.
- If continuing this thread: keep iterating same active S-cycle ID when unresolved; open new ID only on scope reset/change.
- Threshold-bridge queue (slow cadence): continue technical S-branches only (`S276`/`S277`/`S278`).
- `S275`, `D21`, `D22`, and `C300` are closed and archived in this session.
- Relativistic now at PLB boundary (6pp); treat as frozen unless compact replacement edit is required.
- HD-QFT at 6pp boundary.
- Delta-objects at PLB limit — frozen. Dirac-probes at 7pp — FROZEN.
- Bibliography: Lanczos, Fraser-Nakane, Delaunay, Nauenberg2003 source ingestion.
- Cornerstone queue: optional freeze-pass cycle for submission-oriented consistency sweep (notation, transitions, duplicate-claim trim) after commit batch.
- Scaffolding cadence: prefer batched C-waves (multiple paragraph-level promotions per cycle) to reduce cycle-directory overhead.

**Standing priorities:**
- Open questions from `docs/motivations.md` all analyzed. Focus shifts to expansion.
- P cycles for satellite submissions when ready.
- Future satellites: item C (Ordering), D (Rooted Trees), A (RCP).

**Deprioritized:**
- `[Landsman1998]`: PENDING_LIBRARY — requires institutional Springer access or physical library visit.

## Session Addenda (2026-02-14)
- Location semantics: files in `cycles/` are selectable active logs; archived files in `cycles/archive/` are archived.
- Cycle artifacts are append-only in this session.
- Workflow rule: `S`/`D` must use blackboards/notebooks (no `paper/notes/`); `C` may use `paper/notes/` only when adding content to the same paper target.

## Session Addenda (2026-02-14, 03:05 CET)
- `S275` (iteration 5): added stricter 8-caveat compression gate; new default candidate `D4plus` (31 words, 8/8 caveat coverage, ~72.5% compression).
- `C300` remains deferred and optional (readability-only trigger, no correctness defect).

## Session Addenda (2026-02-14, 03:10 CET)
- Metric correction: `S275` selected candidate `D4plus` compresses by `~65.9%` (91 -> 31 words), not `~72.5%`.
- `D21` (iteration 3): launch gate now includes deterministic tie-break (coverage first, compression second); current recommendation remains `D4plus`.
- `S276` (iteration 3): added windowed uniqueness criterion (report global vs operating-window crossings + range bracket).
- `D22` (iteration 3): added bounded navigation gate; `X2` candidate parked, insertion still deferred to readability pass.
- `S277` (iteration 3): added decade-drift validity gate (`Delta nu_10`) for finite-window fixed-exponent claims.
- `S278` (iteration 3): added finite-window potential-drift gate (`Delta m_max`) and cross-family tolerance comparison.
- `D21` (iteration 4): integrated launch matrix added; C300 remains deferred by policy preference, not readiness gaps.
- `S275` (iteration 6): default compression candidate switched to TeX-ready `D6_tex_compact` (8/8 caveats, ~56% compression).
- `D21` (iteration 5): launch preference aligned to `D6_tex_compact` for lower promotion friction.
- Boundary correction: notation-style promotion-readiness checks reassigned from `S275` to `D21`/future `C300`; `S275` remains technical-only.
- Boundary correction (superseding prior split): notation-style harmonization is `C`-only (except explicit TeX-discovery tasks); `D21` kept to launch triage.
- Postmortem correction: D21 policy-heavy iterations marked as discovery-inactive/admin trace; D22 narrowed to discovery-only conceptual triage.
- `C300` (completed, uncommitted): compressed `Remark P1.1a` in `paper/main.md` to a caveat-preserving 2-sentence form (`+1 -1`).
- `C300` (closed, no promotion): paragraph restored by user request; manuscript net diff returned to `+0 -0`.
- `D22` closed: no new conceptual relation established in discovery pass.
- `D21` closed: administrative/policy trace only (not discovery).
- Drift postmortem: ambiguity came from missing explicit prohibition of policy/editorial tasks in `D`; fixed by adding `D` scope guard in `cycles/README.md` and strict track mapping in `AGENTS.md`/`docs/handoff.md`.
- `S277` (iteration 4): generalized drift gate to arbitrary scale factor `Delta nu_b`, with peak-location formula and asymptotic window estimates.
