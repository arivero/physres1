## Next Action
Priority: advance the follow-up papers (dependent on `paper/main.md`).
1. Continue `C13`: keep the Planck-area/selection discussion modular and hypothesis-labeled; avoid conflating with other dimension filters.
2. Keep `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` moving: decide what subset (if any) should be promoted back into `paper/main.md` without bloating the manuscript (Gaussian semigroup witness, boundary-condition view, and now 1D/3D context).
3. Optional: add an independent anchor for the 1D U(2) contact-interaction classification (Albeverio/Kurasov lineage) when polishing.

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
