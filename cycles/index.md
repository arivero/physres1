## Next Action
Priority: half-densities + dependent follow-up drafts.
1. Run a quick Q-pass (`Q01`, optional) after B01/S01/C23 promotions (check claim hygiene + citation placement).
2. Decide next content direction: deepen the half-density \(\Rightarrow\) universal scale hypothesis (new `C24`) or expand the RG note’s independent anchors (new `B02`).

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
