## Next Action
Priority: advance the follow-up papers (dependent on `paper/main.md`).
1. Execute `C16`: add a near-diagonal scaling/composition derivation that makes the half-density \(\varepsilon^{-d/2}\) normalization concrete and sharpens where the universal \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scale enters.
2. Continue `C13`: keep the Planck-area/selection discussion modular and hypothesis-labeled; avoid conflating with other dimension filters.
3. Keep `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` moving: decide what subset (if any) should be promoted back into `paper/main.md` without bloating the manuscript (Gaussian semigroup witness, boundary-condition view of the 2D delta).

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
