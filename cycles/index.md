## Next Action
**9 satellite papers all at Tier 1. All cross-referenced from cornerstone.**
Cornerstone at ~1486 lines.

Recent completed:
1. S182+C223: Källén-Lehmann spectral representation Remark 2.1 in fermionic (+5 lines).
2. S183+C224: OPE Remark 4.5 in fermionic (+4 lines). tHooft1974 citation fix in 6.4.
3. Q122: reviewing C221-C224 (in progress).

Next:
- Satellites: fermionic 218 (16pp), action-angle 213 (16pp), uncuttable 210 (15pp).
- Uncuttable is shortest — prioritize next remarks there.
- Continue S+C expansion. All three now at 210+ lines.
- P cycles for satellite submissions when ready.
- Future satellites: item C (Ordering), D (Rooted Trees), A (RCP).

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- `[Landsman1998]`: PENDING_LIBRARY — requires institutional Springer access or physical library visit.
