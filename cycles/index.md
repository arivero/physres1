**Total archived: ~2400 cycle files (4 files each × ~600 cycles).**

## Active / In Progress

- `Q129` — Referee pass on C243 (delta-objects Remark 4.2). Running.

## Next Action

**Page counts** (elsarticle 3p twocolumn = PLB format; run `scripts/count-pages.sh`):
- PLB-length (≤6pp): HD-QFT 4pp, delta 4pp, dirac 4pp, relativistic 4pp.
- PRD-length (>6pp): action-angle 13pp, fermionic 13pp, uncuttable 13pp, rg-fund 9pp, planck-area 14pp.
- Cornerstone: 23pp (Physics Reports target).

**Recent completed:**
- S203+C243: Self-adjoint extensions → Remark 4.2 in delta-objects (+10 lines, now 188, 4pp).
  Corrected H¹→H² Sobolev, ε^{-d/2}→Λ^{d-2} resolvent exponent, added Derezinski 2024.

**Immediate:**
- Apply Q129 fixes if any.
- Below PLB limit, room for expansion: HD-QFT (4pp), delta (4pp), dirac (4pp), relativistic (4pp).

**Standing priorities:**
- Open questions from `docs/motivations.md` have priority over expansion.
- P cycles for satellite submissions when ready.
- Future satellites: item C (Ordering), D (Rooted Trees), A (RCP).

**Deprioritized:**
- `[Landsman1998]`: PENDING_LIBRARY — requires institutional Springer access or physical library visit.
