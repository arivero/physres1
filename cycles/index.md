## Next Action
Priority: integrate the “control map \(\tau\)” refinement story and strengthen RG-as-compatibility framing (half-densities now treated as established background).
1. `S57`: decide whether to open a dedicated `papers/string-tension-as-area-scale/main.md` draft (only if multiple waves justify it).
2. `S58`: return to the \(\tau\) formalization agenda: re-express `Derivation D6.0` as a “compare-at-fixed-ruler” lemma independent of regulator language.

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
