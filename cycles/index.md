**Page counts** (elsarticle 3p twocolumn = PLB format; run `scripts/count-pages.sh`):
- PLB-length (≤6pp): relativistic 6pp (296), HD-QFT 6pp (265), delta 6pp (218).
- PRD-length (>6pp): dirac 7pp (256), rg-fund 9pp, action-angle 13pp, fermionic 13pp, uncuttable 13pp, planck-area 14pp.
- Cornerstone: 23pp (Physics Reports target).
- **Total corpus: ~125k tokens (Claude tokenizer).**

**Recent completed:**
- C298+Q181: readability pointer hardening on `paper/main.md` (Section 9.5 quick map + `D10.4a`); Q181 PASS.
- C297+Q180: RCP cross-link hardening on `paper/main.md` (`D10.1b` linking domain-data witness to operational closure map); Q180 PASS.
- C296+Q179: Package B deeper extension witness on `paper/main.md` (`D9.1f`, `D9.1g`); Q179 PASS.
- C295+Q178: Package A sanity-limit hardening on `paper/main.md` (`D12.3b`); Q178 PASS.
- C294+Q177: Package A exact nontrivial kernel benchmark on `paper/main.md` (`D12.3`, `D12.3a`); Q177 PASS.
- C293+Q176: main-paper Package A quantitative hardening on `paper/main.md`. Added `P12.2` bounded-potential remainder/composition-defect control; Q176 PASS.
- C291+Q174+C292+Q175: YOLO main-paper continuation on `paper/main.md`. Extended Package B to curved-manifold operator-domain witness (`D9.1d`, `D9.1e`) and Package A to first-order bounded-potential composition witness (`D12.2`, `D12.2a`). Q174/Q175 PASS.
- C289+Q172+C290+Q173: main-paper hardening wave on `paper/main.md`. Added Package C/D/A/E starter derivations (D6.4, D8.2a, D12.1/P12.1, compatibility map), then closed Package B starter with explicit `S^1` domain/symmetry witness (D9.1b, D9.1c). Q172/Q173 PASS.
- C288: converted Section 9 closing prose into task-driven Package A-E queue (`+27 -8`).

**Immediate:**
- Relativistic now at PLB boundary (6pp); treat as frozen unless compact replacement edit is required.
- HD-QFT at 6pp boundary.
- Delta-objects at PLB limit — frozen. Dirac-probes at 7pp — FROZEN.
- Bibliography: Lanczos, Fraser-Nakane, Delaunay, Nauenberg2003 source ingestion.
- Cornerstone queue: optional freeze-pass cycle for submission-oriented consistency sweep (notation, transitions, duplicate-claim trim) after commit batch.
- Scaffolding cadence: prefer batched C-waves (multiple paragraph-level promotions per cycle) to reduce cycle-directory overhead.

**Standing priorities:**
- Open questions from `docs/motivations.md` all analyzed. Focus shifts to expansion.
- P cycles for satellite submissions when ready.
- Future satellites: item C (Ordering), D (Rooted Trees), A (RCP).

**Deprioritized:**
- `[Landsman1998]`: PENDING_LIBRARY — requires institutional Springer access or physical library visit.
