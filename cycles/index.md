## Next Action
Priority: advance the follow-up papers (dependent on `paper/main.md`).
1. Execute `C13`: turn `papers/planck-area/main.md` into a substantive note (one concrete half-density composition model + one anchored derivation).
2. Keep `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` moving: decide what subset (if any) should be promoted back into `paper/main.md` without bloating the manuscript.

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
