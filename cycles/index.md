## Next Action
Priority: integrate the “control map \(\tau\)” refinement story and strengthen RG-as-compatibility framing (half-densities now treated as established background).
1. `Q18`: run a quality pass on the D1.5b/D1.5c/D1.5d block.
2. `S30`: explore whether a fully covariant area 2-form postulate can be phrased without explicit source-frame projection.

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- ingest local PDFs for pending keys (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`).
