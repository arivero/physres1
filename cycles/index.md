## Next Action
**9 satellite papers all at Tier 1. All cross-referenced from cornerstone.**
Cornerstone at ~1486 lines.

Recent completed:
1. Q106+S117+C158: 1D delta resolvent Example 4.1 in delta-objects satellite (+6 lines, 172→178). Q106 fixed Trotter Remark 3.3 in uncuttable (convergence order, domain conditions, citation).
2. S116+C157: Trotter product formula Remark 3.3 in uncuttable satellite (+6 lines, 112→118).
3. Q105: referee pass on S114+C155 and S115+C156 — both CLEAN.
4. S115+C156: EBK quantization Remark 6.3 in action-angle satellite (+6 lines, 100→106).
5. S114+C155: 3D contact scattering-length Example 5.2 in fermionic mediators satellite (+7 lines, 122→129).

Next:
- Content gaps: Gap 4 (RG flow on realistic coupling, high).
- Expand shorter satellites (action-angle 106, uncuttable 118, fermionic mediators 129).
- P cycles for satellite submissions when ready.
- Future satellites: item C (Ordering), D (Rooted Trees), A (RCP).

Deprioritized unless blocking a revision:
- `[Landsman1998]`: PENDING_LIBRARY — requires institutional Springer access or physical library visit.
