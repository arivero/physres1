## Failure modes
1. Declaring "no new principle" too quickly and missing a deeper algebraic unification.
2. Encoding the distinction only in cycle files, not manuscript language.

## Mitigations
1. Preserve as open possibility; require explicit evidence before a principle bump.
2. Promote one concise manuscript remark to operationalize the distinction (`C287`).
