# D07 Red Team: Risks in hygiene-focused discovery work

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- “Discovery” degenerates into admin-only work:
  - Mitigation: time-cap hygiene waves and immediately return to a bounded technical `S` cycle (`D08 → Sxx`).
- Removing pointers reduces internal traceability:
  - Mitigation: keep traceability in cycle artifacts and project notes, not in rendered manuscript prose.
- Board drift persists:
  - Mitigation: update `cycles/index.md` in the same commit as the cycle artifacts and logs.
