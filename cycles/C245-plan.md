# C245 — Plan

## Goal
Promote S205 (SR orbit precession) into the relativistic orbits paper
as a remark after Section 3.1.

## Reviewer-driven revisions
1. Include brief derivation path (cite BoscagginDambrosioFeltrin2020)
2. Justify L² = GMm²a(1−e²) for precessing orbits (conic geometry)
3. Reference Section 4 for GR precession formula
4. Mention ω = 1/γ connection (reviewer discovery)

## Scope
- Add ~12 lines as Remark 3.2 (after Section 3.1)
- Include the Binet equation, precessing ellipse solution, precession
  formula, 1/6 ratio, and ω = 1/γ insight
