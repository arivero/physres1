## Failure Modes
1. Fixing the sign in one place but leaving a contradictory sign elsewhere (silent inconsistency).
2. Overcorrecting by rewriting too much “standard scattering” material (scope creep).

## Mitigations
- Search for remaining occurrences of the old \(+i\) 3D term and verify only the intended two locations exist.
- If normalization clarity is needed, add only one short parenthetical remark rather than expanding the scattering review.
