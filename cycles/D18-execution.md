# D18 Execution: Deepen threshold-bridge research with explicit back-and-forth

Date: 2026-02-14
Status: Completed

## Actions
1. Reframed the current thread from "quick bridge" to "stress-tested bridge" with explicit objection-response checkpoints.
2. Chosen strategy: deepen two existing notes (no new note files) to respect `paper/notes/` cap.
3. Spawned `S272` and `S273` with clear division:
   - S272: coefficient-aware analytic refinement.
   - S273: assumption-break and counterexample stress tests.

## Outcome
- Research path shifted to slower, higher-rigor cadence before any next C-cycle promotion.
