# S195: Execution — Study anomaly matching blackboard

**Date:** 2026-02-13

Wrote blackboard 1 on anomaly matching. Reviewed by particle theory specialist subagent: 3 MEDIUM (integrality overstated → discrete/quantized, HS constraint oversimplified, dichotomy incomplete — added SPT phases). All corrections applied before promotion.
