# S167 Debate: Charge sign convention in AB remark

Date: 2026-02-13

## Question
Use e for electron charge (negative) or e>0 with explicit signs?

## Working answer
Adopt e>0 convention consistent with the rest of the paper; write −e where the electron charge is needed.

## Next check
Confirm convention matches action-angle paper Section 1 notation during C208 promotion.
