# S167 Execution: Aharonov-Bohm effect for action-angle Section 5

Date: 2026-02-13

## Work performed
- QM expert reviewer confirmed all claims: AB phase formula exp(ieΦ/ℏc), flux quantum Φ₀=hc/e, ring energy spectrum shift are correct.
- Minor clarification: charge sign convention — use e>0 with explicit minus for electron where needed.

## Result
- All claims stable; ready for promotion as Remark 5.4 via C208.

## Discovery flag
- **No.** Standard confirmations, no surprises.
