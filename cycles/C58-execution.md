# C58 Execution: Promote Minimal Timelike-Structure Rule

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5f` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` after D1.5e.
- Promoted a branch-scoped operational rule:
  - use source 4-velocity \(U^\mu\) as distinguished timelike direction,
  - formulate postulate on \(\ell_{(U)}\),
  - treat coordinate-time areal rates as derived quantities.
- Kept wording non-universal and tied to current central-source inverse-square branch.
