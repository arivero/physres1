# D16 Debate: Is the target genuinely novel?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Is \(q_\mathrm{crit}=\nu+1\) just restating known scaling, or does it add value in this repo?

## Resolution
It is known scaling logic, but new value here is architectural: it cleanly unifies existing Newtonian/SR remarks and prevents conflating asymptotic-kinematic and dimensional mechanisms. Worth promoting as a compact organizing remark.
