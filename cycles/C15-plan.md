# C15 Plan

## Goal
Strengthen the delta/RG thread beyond in-repo preprints by adding independent validation and one explicit coarse-graining (information-loss) example.

## Scope
1. Identify and ingest a non-Rivero standard reference for renormalization of the \(2\)D delta potential (OA if possible; otherwise mark `PENDING`).
2. Identify/ingest the intended “Cristina 2D delta” reference and align conventions with the derivation in `paper/main.md` and `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`.
3. Add one explicit coarse-graining map example (not just coupling running) illustrating non-invertibility while preserving the semigroup property.

## Risks
1. The intended references may not be OA-accessible from the environment.
2. “Coarse-graining example” may sprawl unless kept toy-level.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `paper/bibliography.md` includes at least one independent validation source for the 2D delta renormalization.
2. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` cites the validation source and states the match of key formulas (\(\beta(g)\), dimensional transmutation scale) up to conventions.
3. A toy coarse-graining example is included with an explicit semigroup law and an explicit non-invertibility statement.
