# S50 Execution: Control-Map View of the \(H=pq\) Ordering Family

## Work
- Reinterpreted the \(H=pq\) ordering ambiguity as (partly) a representation choice tied to Jacobians/half-densities.
- Wrote a short derivation showing unitarity of the dilation group selects the symmetric generator:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-dilation-generator-unitarity-and-half-density.md`

## Result
For this toy model, the constant-term/ordering ambiguity can be phrased as a "control condition" selection problem:
requiring unitary composition forces the half-density factor and picks the symmetric ordering.

## Next
- `C77`: optionally tighten the `paper/main.md` H0.2 item-2 parenthetical to mention the unitarity/half-density selection principle (one short clause).
