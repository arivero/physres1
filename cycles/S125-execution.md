# S125 Execution

## Blackboard
Wrote blackboard slot 0: unitarity limit / universal few-body physics.
5 claims covering scale invariance, Bertsch parameter, Feshbach resonance, BEC-BCS crossover, Efimov effect.
## Reviewer feedback
Cold-atom experimentalist: all 5 claims CORRECT (minor caveats on "RG flow" interpretation and Efimov being stronger for bosons). Recommends focusing on claims 1-4 for the satellite remark, omitting Efimov.
