# C09 Debate

## Claim
A concrete left-vs-Weyl pair is sufficient to anchor ordering ambiguity.

## Objection
One pair may be too narrow to justify broader claims.

## Resolution
State the result as an example-backed class statement with explicit order-bound caveat.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
The appendix should preserve direct continuity with `C04` and `C05`.

## Objection
Technical operator formulas can disconnect from narrative flow.

## Resolution
Keep one-line bridge text to `C04` slicing and `C05` deformation equivalence.

## Status
Accepted.
