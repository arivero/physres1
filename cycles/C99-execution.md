# C99 Execution: clarify Euler step-doubling witness (explicit \(f'(y)[f(y)]\); show modified equation)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Summary of changes
- Clarified the step-doubling discrepancy notation by writing the elementary differential as \(f'(y)[f(y)]\) (and defining the shorthand once).
- Expanded the modified-equation remark to display the exact-flow expansion used to solve for \(g=-\tfrac12 f'(y)[f(y)]\).
- Rebuilt `papers/rg-fundamental/main.pdf`.
