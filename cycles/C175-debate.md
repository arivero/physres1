# C175 Debate: Efimov Remark 5.5

Date: 2026-02-13

## Pro
- Extends 2-body contact theme to 3-body with qualitatively new RG structure
- Shows extension data hierarchy grows with particle number
- Experimentally verified phenomenon

## Con
- Paper title says "fermionic mediators" but Efimov is bosonic
  → Section 5 already covers general contact interactions, not just fermionic

## Resolution
Promoted. Fits naturally after Remark 5.4's dimensional dependence discussion.
