Wrote blackboard slot 1: KAM theorem / integrability boundary.
5 claims covering KAM persistence, resonant torus destruction, BGS conjecture, boundary statement, ETH.
## Reviewer feedback
Mathematical physicist: all 5 claims CORRECT (caveats: BGS is conjecture not theorem; ETH concerns matrix elements not literal uniformity; mixed regime has Berry-Robnik statistics). Well-scoped for a brief outlook remark.
