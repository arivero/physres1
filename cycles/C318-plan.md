# C318 Plan: Final Rooted-Tree Expansions (Conclusion + Order-3)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Expand rooted-tree paper to PRD length with concluding section and order-3 tree example

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md`

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Section 7: Conclusion (tie together literal vs analogy, composition compatibility)
- Add Section 3.5: Order-3 trees and Butcher product (tree grafting, RG parallel)
- ~45 lines total (expand from 7pp to 8pp, PRD target achieved)

Out of scope:
- Full symplectic RK example (deferred)
- Backward error analysis (mentioned in conclusion, not worked)

## Minimum promotion bar
Add both sections (~45 lines)

## Allowed files
- `papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md`
- `cycles/C318-*.md`

## Acceptance criteria
- Sections added
- Diffstat recorded
- No cycle IDs
- Compiled page count: 8-9pp (PRD length)
