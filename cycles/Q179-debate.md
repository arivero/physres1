# Q179 Debate: Is contact-extension data too disconnected from ordering/discretization?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Does adding point-interaction extension data dilute the ordering/discretization narrative of Section 10.2?

## Recommendation
No. It broadens "representation compatibility" from ordering alone to include admissible domain data, which is aligned with the section's stated scope.
