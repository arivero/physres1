# Q79 Debate

## Hard question
Should the supplementary material reference (line 112) block P01?

## Resolution
No. The reference says loop integrals "are collected in the supplementary material," but the integrals are already given explicitly in Sections 5.1 (2D) and 5.8.1 (3D). A formal supplementary appendix would be nice but is not blocking — the content is already present in the main text. A future C cycle can either inline a clarification ("as given explicitly in Sections 5.1 and 5.8.1") or add a formal appendix. This is a polish item, not a correctness issue.
