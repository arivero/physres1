# C89 Red Team: Referee Risks for the Action–Angle Dependent Note

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Overclaiming “uncertainty principle” content:
  - Mitigation: phrase as a concrete Fourier/conjugacy tradeoff; avoid implying a force-range mechanism.
- Angle-operator pathology objection:
  - Mitigation: explicitly avoid the self-adjoint angle operator and use the unitary \(E=e^{i\phi}\) plus separation/Fourier arguments.
- “Uniform in \(\phi\)” misinterpreted as pointwise uniformity for all states:
  - Mitigation: restrict the statement to \(L_z\) eigenstates and explain the superposition requirement for localization.
- Reader mismatch (what is meant by “action–angle” in this limited setting):
  - Mitigation: state up front that this note is the \((\phi,L_z)\) sector witness only; keep full action–angle/EBK to outlook.
- Citation burden creep:
  - Mitigation: keep the note derivation-first; use one OA anchor for the \(e^{im\phi}\) factor and avoid leaning on any transcript or non-ingested source.
