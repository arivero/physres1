# S166 Plan: Zeta-function regularization for uncuttable Section 2

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Verify zeta-function regularization claims (ζ(−1)=−1/12, spectral determinant formula, Hawking reference) for promotion as Remark 2.7 in the uncuttable paper.

## Deliverable
- Blackboard note confirming all claims; clarify "regularized value" wording and the string theory connection involving both ζ(0) and ζ(−1).
