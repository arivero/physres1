# S137 Red Team: Berry-Tabor and spectral statistics

Date: 2026-02-13

## Checks
1. Berry-Tabor (1977): P(s) = exp(-s) correct. Reference verified.
2. BGS (1984): GOE Wigner surmise P(s) = (π/2)s exp(-πs²/4) correct. PRL 52, 1-4 confirmed.
3. GUE: Quadratic repulsion confirmed. Proportionality form used in blackboard — promoted remark avoids explicit GUE formula, describes qualitatively.
4. Brody distribution: Correct functional form, correct limiting cases.
5. Line count: +3 net (136→139). C cycle bar met.
