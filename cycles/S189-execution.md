# S189 Execution: Hubbard-Stratonovich Transformation

## Work Done
1. Wrote blackboard 1 on HS transformation, Gaussian identity, trace-log effective action
2. Launched many-body theorist persona reviewer (SubAgent)
3. Applied all corrections from reviewer feedback

## Reviewer Findings
- **HIGH (2)**: fermion determinant trace-log connection missing, channel decomposition (Fierz) caveat essential
- **MEDIUM (3)**: Gaussian identity normalization, path-integral vs heuristic framing, RG inheritance assumptions
- **LOW (3)**: notation, example choices, reference alignment

## Changes Applied
- Explicit trace-log formula: det[...] = exp[Tr log(...)]
- Added Fierz rearrangement caveat for channel decomposition
- Clarified Gaussian identity normalization constant
- Separated path-integral derivation from heuristic discussion
- Noted large-N_f requirement for saddle-point control
- Discussed RG matching (non-trivial) vs direct inheritance

## Status
Ready for C230 promotion.
