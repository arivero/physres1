# C66 Plan: Promote Weak Variational-Derivative Bridge

## Goal
Promote S39 results into `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` Section 3.

## Scope
- Add one concise remark linking weak Euler-Lagrange derivatives to the regulate/subtract/limit pattern.
- Include jump \(\to\delta\) contact-term statement.

## Acceptance Tests
- Manuscript edit is substantive.
- Bridge remains framed as structural compatibility grammar, not framework identity.
- `cycles/C66-execution.md` logs manuscript diffstat.
