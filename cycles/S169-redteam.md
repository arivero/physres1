# S169 — Red Team

- **Critical fix:** Duistermaat reference was WRONG (CMP 77 -> Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 33 (1980) 687). Must correct in .bib before promotion.
- GL(d,Z) is correct group for monodromy (preserves integer lattice); reviewer confirmed.
- Quantum lattice defect phrasing is physically sound but should cite Cushman-Duistermaat or Child (2007) for the semiclassical side.
