Parent: D49-D59, motivations.md three-stage thesis

## Novelty target
Synthesize the D49-D59 discoveries into the project's core thesis: each stage
of physics is a FORCED COMPLETION of the previous stage's composition law.

## The forced-completion chain

| Stage | Structure | Completion requirement | What's forced | RCP axiom |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0→1 | Discrete → Continuous | Refinement limits exist | Calculus, smooth dynamics | (precursor) |
| 1→2 | Classical → Quantum | Transition amplitudes compose | exp(iS/ℏ), d/2, κ=ℏ | **A1** |
| 2→3 | QM → QFT | All modes compose simultaneously | Renormalization, RG flow | **A1+A4** |
| 3→? | QFT → ??? | Gravity + composition | ??? | A1+A4+??? |

### Stage 0→1 (Calculus)
Newton's polygonal method: partition [0,T] → refine → limit must exist.
This forces differentiability (calculus) and the Euler-Lagrange equations
(variational principles). **Composition here is temporal concatenation** of
trajectory segments.

### Stage 1→2 (Quantum mechanics) — D49-D59 contribution
Require that transition kernels compose: K_t ∘ K_s = K_{t+s}.
This single axiom (D53) forces ALL of P4.2:
- exp(iS/ℏ) form (D29: exponential uniqueness)
- d/2 normalization (D49: dimension counting)
- iε prescription (D37: degree counting)
- κ=ℏ, identity limit (D50, D53: from setup + composition)
- Lévy exclusion, continuum time (D39: dimensional obstruction)

**The exponential of action is the unique composition-compatible kernel.**
Classical mechanics (δ-function on trajectories) fails to compose as a smooth
kernel — the κ→0 limit is obstructed. Quantum mechanics is the MINIMUM
enrichment that makes composition work.

### Stage 2→3 (QFT) — D54 contribution
Each field mode satisfies QM composition (Stage 1→2, per mode).
Assembling infinitely many modes requires regularization + renormalization.
Scale invariance (A4) controls the assembly.
**Renormalization is the completion of infinite-mode composition.**

### Stage 3→? (Quantum gravity)
QFT on curved spacetime: composition works (D30). But dynamical gravity
(backreaction) means the composition space itself fluctuates. The obstruction:
non-renormalizability of gravity in d=4. **The completion is unknown** (string
theory? LQG? asymptotic safety?).

The D56 hint: half-density composition + conformal invariance selects d=4.
This is suggestive but not a completion mechanism.

## Impact for the project

This table IS the cornerstone paper's thesis, now validated computationally:
- Stage 1→2: D49-D59 prove it's a single-axiom theorem
- Stage 2→3: D54 shows the mode-assembly mechanism
- Stage 3→?: remains the open frontier

**The project's contribution**: stages 1→2 and 2→3 are not postulates but
FORCED COMPLETIONS. Each new layer of physics is the minimum structure needed
to make the previous layer's composition work.

## Novelty assessment
**MODERATE (synthesis).** Individual stages are known. The explicit framing as
a forced-completion chain validated by the D49-D59 axiom reductions is the
project's core value-add.

## Spawned cycles
Consider C-cycle promoting the forced-completion table to cornerstone
Section 10.3 (RCP) or the conclusion. This table would make an effective
summary of the entire paper's thesis.
