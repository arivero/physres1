# S33 Debate: Should We Switch to Bivectors in the Main Text?

## Question
If non-planar motion is admitted, should the manuscript replace scalar area-rate language with bivector-first language throughout?

## Current Resolution
Not globally yet:
- keep scalar language in the planar branch for readability;
- add a short cautionary note that the invariant object is vector/bivector-valued in 3D;
- defer full bivector rewrite unless non-planar dynamics becomes central.
