# C317 Plan: Expand Rooted-Tree Outlook with Hopf Coproduct

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Expand rooted-tree paper Section 6 (Outlook) with explicit Hopf coproduct formulas

## Target manuscripts
- `papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md` (expand Section 6)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add Section 6.2: "Hopf Coproduct: Explicit Example"
- Content: coproduct formulas for \(\tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_3^{(1)}, \tau_3^{(2)}\)
- Connection to composition (Butcher product / BPHZ forest)
- Antipode \(S\) and forest formula worked example
- ~50 lines addition (expand paper from 6pp to ~7pp)

Out of scope:
- Full coalgebra proofs (keep computational)
- Two-loop BPHZ explicit calculation (save for later expansion)

## Minimum promotion bar
Add Section 6.2 with explicit formulas (~50 lines)

## Allowed files
- `papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md`
- `cycles/C317-*.md`

## Acceptance criteria
- Section 6.2 added (renumbered old 6.2 to 6.3)
- Diffstat recorded
- No cycle IDs
- Compiled page count: target 7-8pp
