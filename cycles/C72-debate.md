# C72 Debate: Mention Confinement Diagnostics or Avoid?

## Question
Should the remark mention Wilson loops/area laws as the diagnostic of \(\sigma\), or keep it purely dimensional/logical?

## Current Resolution
Keep it purely logical and dimensional. Add diagnostics only after a dedicated bibliography cycle.
