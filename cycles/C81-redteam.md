# C81 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim**: readers infer "constants are derived" rather than "constants play these roles in this program."
2. **Bloat**: the Introduction becomes too dense with heuristics.
3. **Ambiguity**: "compatibility" sounds vague without pointers.

## Mitigations
1. Keep the phrase "can be read as" and "in this program" explicit.
2. Keep to one paragraph.
3. Rely on existing later sections for the concrete bridges (stationary phase, SR/GR dependent drafts, Planck-area follow-up).
