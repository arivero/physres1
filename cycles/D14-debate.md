# D14 Debate: is this “novelty” or just polish?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Is adding the next term in the Euler step-halving discrepancy (and unifying notation) genuinely advancing the project, or is it merely cosmetic?

## Current position
It is primarily clarity work, but it also strengthens the rooted-tree bookkeeping thesis by giving one more explicit, checkable data point showing how composed refinement generates a hierarchy of correction terms.

## What would change my mind?
- If the next-term expansion/interpretation becomes notationally heavy (hurting the reader more than helping), or if it cannot be presented in one short remark that stays self-contained.
