# S149 Plan: Bargmann representation and action-angle duality

Date: 2026-02-13

## Goal
Study the Bargmann-Segal holomorphic representation as the algebraic form of the action-angle duality, for promotion into action-angle satellite Section 6.

## Steps
1. Write blackboard 0: Bargmann transform, Fock states as monomials, coherent states as reproducing kernels, Husimi function connection.
2. Launch reviewer subagent (mathematical physicist / geometric quantization persona).
3. Incorporate corrections and promote to Remark 6.8.
