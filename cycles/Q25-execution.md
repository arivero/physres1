# Q25 Execution: Quality Pass on D1.5b-D1.5k

## Checks Run
- Reviewed D1.5b through D1.5k in `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
- Verified D1.5k aligns with D1.5j and remains a baseline (not overclaiming full statistical closure).
- Guardrail check:
  - `rg -n 'C[0-9]{2}' paper/main.md` (clean).

## Findings
- Sequence remains coherent and appropriately layered.
- No manuscript edits required in this pass.
