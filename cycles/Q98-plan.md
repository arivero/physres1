# Q98 Plan: Subagent-delegated referee pass on uncuttable + Dirac Probes
Date: 2026-02-13

## Method
Delegated Q passes to fresh-context subagents per new AGENTS.md policy.
Two parallel subagent referees reviewed:
1. Uncuttable Controlled Refinement (96 lines)
2. Dirac Probes / Corners / Impulses (193 lines)

## Key findings to address
### Uncuttable (from subagent referee):
- Remark 2.2: f^(k)/k! vs f^(k) confusion → FIX (clarify both readings)
- "Cornerstone manuscript" never cited → ACCEPT (companion note convention)
- Section 2.5 vs Section 2 redundancy → ACCEPT (2.5 formalizes what 2 describes)
- Greek typesetting → minor, defer

### Dirac Probes (from subagent referee):
- Abstract overstates renormalization (d=1 ok) → FIX
- Strikethrough in Outlook → FIX (remove editorial artifact)
- Missing Feynman-Hibbs ref for Section 4.5 → FIX
- Theorem 3.1-3.2 proofs terse → ACCEPT (intentional compression)
