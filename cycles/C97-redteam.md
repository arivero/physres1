# C97 Red Team: Standalone half-density QFT note promotion risks

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- Overclaiming from the \(D=4\) cancellation:
  - Mitigation: include an explicit scope disclaimer; avoid “dimension selection” language.
- Added support becomes too long / distracts from main message:
  - Mitigation: keep the new derivations compact and clearly optional (remark-style).
- Hidden bibliography debt sneaks in:
  - Mitigation: avoid new citations; if a standard attribution is required later, spawn a `B` cycle instead of guessing.
