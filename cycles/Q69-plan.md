# Q69 Plan: Referee pass on C114 (linear/nonlinear beta boundary)

Date: 2026-02-12

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C114`: added paragraph to Section 8.4/8.5 transition contrasting D6.2a-sg's linear beta (no transmutation) with D6.2's nonlinear beta (transmutation).

## Goal
Referee-pass the C114 manuscript changes for correctness, clarity, claim hygiene, and reader experience.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q69-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts, blackboards, notes, bibliography, sources

## Checklist
- Cross-reference validity: D6.2a-sg, D6.2, P6.2 exist at cited locations.
- Formula verification: β(a) = 1/2 - a → algebraic invariant; β(g) = -cg² → Λ* ~ μ exp(1/(cg)).
- Claim scope: "structural gap" accurately describes the toy/full RG difference.
- Sign convention: exp(1/(cg)) matches PA-D1.6a.
- Placement: logical position between Section 8.4 closing and §8.5.

## Acceptance criteria
- Concrete list of follow-ups as spawned cycles (or "none").
