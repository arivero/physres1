# C67 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Abstraction overload:** new heuristic appears detached from calculations.
2. **Overclaiming 3D simplicity:** ignores richer multichannel/partial-wave contexts.
3. **Terminology ambiguity:** "complexity" may be read as computational cost rather than parameter-space structure.

## Mitigations
1. Place remark directly after P1.6 dimensional scaling list.
2. Scope explicitly to the draft's contact branches (1D full-family, 2D marginal branch, 3D s-wave branch).
3. Keep wording "effective one-parameter" where needed.
