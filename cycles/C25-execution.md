# C25 Execution

## Changes
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md`
   - Added `Heuristic H2.5b1` clarifying that “perturbative analyticity” for dimensionful couplings requires a reference scale \(\mu\) (dimensionless \(\hat g(\mu)\)), and that demanding a \(\mu\)-independent universal constant then forces either the monomial sieve or non-analytic transmutation (outside H2.5b).

## Status
Completed.
