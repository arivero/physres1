# D13 Red-Team: Post-promotion housekeeping after `S67 → C99 → Q56`

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
1. **Cycle board drift:** completed cycles not reflected in `cycles/index.md`, causing repeated work.
2. **Log gaps:** missing dated entries makes later continuation difficult.
3. **Next-action overload:** too many low-priority items dilute focus.

## Mitigations
- Update `cycles/index.md` immediately after closing a promotion chain.
- Add at least one sentence per cycle to `docs/research-log.md` while details are fresh.
- Keep the next-action list capped (≤3 items) and time-box optional bibliography work.
