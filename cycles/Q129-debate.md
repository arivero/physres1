# Q129 — Debate

## Key question
Should the remark discuss the full U(2) family in d=1 or only the delta subfamily?

## Resolution
Delta subfamily only, but the overarching statement must not overclaim.
Changed "form a one-parameter family" → "include a distinguished one-parameter
family of spherically symmetric extensions." This is truthful:
- In d=1, the spherically symmetric (even-parity) restriction gives 1 parameter.
- In d=2 and d=3, isotropy gives 1 parameter.
- The parenthetical "(delta-subfamily with psi continuous)" remains.
The full U(2) story in d=1 would require discussing transfer matrices,
which is out of scope for this PLB note.
