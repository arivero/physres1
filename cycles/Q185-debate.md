## Hard Question
Does marking P5.2a with a specific numerical estimate (0.06 meV) make the paper more vulnerable to being dated by improvements in experimental resolution?

## Resolution
No. The key content is the O(α²) scaling law and the structural four-layer stratification. The numerical estimate is a concreteness anchor, not the claim. Even if resolution improves by an order of magnitude, the perturbative regime (α₀ ≤ 0.3) would still give |ΔE₀| < 0.06 meV, which is a statement about the system, not about detector technology. The non-perturbative edge (α₀ > 0.5) where the shift becomes measurable is where perturbation theory breaks down anyway.
