# D03 Red Team: Risks in the “RCP Compatibility Diagram” Target

Date: 2026-02-11

## Failure modes
- “Novelty” is only renaming:
  - Mitigation: require an explicit toy-family closure equation in `S63` that can fail for a wrong convention.
- Diagram becomes too abstract for the manuscript’s current audience:
  - Mitigation: keep it to 6–10 lines plus one worked micro-example; no category-theory overhead.
- Hidden bibliography debt appears (e.g. needing formal RG/quantization sources):
  - Mitigation: keep the promoted block definition/derivation-first; add sources only for attribution, not as proof substitutes.
- Scope creep into BV/BRST or deep measure theory:
  - Mitigation: keep those as outlook only; the diagram is about the three compatibilities already present in the manuscript.
