# S94 Execution: Delta-objects paper expansion assessment
Date: 2026-02-13

## Finding
The delta-objects Outlook item 1 (Van Vleck connection) is a clean, self-contained addition. The Van Vleck determinant |det(-∂²S/∂q_f∂q_i)|^{1/2} is a stationary-phase instance of the square-root Hessian pattern in Section 3.3. For the free particle, it reduces to (m/Δt)^{d/2} — the same t^{-d/2} normalization as Section 2.

## Recommendation
Add Section 3.5 making this connection explicit. Include free-particle example. ~20 net lines.
