## Decision
The free particle is the simplest possible system where D4.2a's pattern can be made fully explicit: the integral is exactly Gaussian, the minimum is at the midpoint q̄ = (q₀+q₂)/2 (uniform velocity), and the ℏ→0 recovery is trivial but illustrative. Alternative examples considered: (a) harmonic oscillator (also Gaussian but more algebra), (b) quartic potential (non-Gaussian, would need numerical methods). The free particle wins on clarity and minimalism.
