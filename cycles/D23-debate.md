# D23 Debate: Does “unitarity selects midpoint” overclaim?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Is the manuscript’s informal slogan “unitarity selects the symmetric (half-density) convention” strictly correct in the \(H=qp\) witness, or does it require additional domain/measure hypotheses?

## Working answer
Likely: symmetry/self-adjointness is the real selection gate, and it depends on the Hilbert-space pairing and boundary behavior (e.g. at \(q=0\) for \(\mathbb R_+\)). The “unitarity selects midpoint” claim should be phrased as a conditional statement unless a uniqueness theorem is shown.

## Next check
Compute adjoints and boundary terms for \(-i\hbar(q\partial_q + c)\) on explicit domains and map back to \(\alpha\).
