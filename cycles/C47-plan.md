# C47 Plan: Promote S18 “Delta-Kernel Derivative” Dictionary into Half-Density QFT Draft

## Goal
Strengthen the QFT half-density draft’s “contact terms” section by promoting the S18 coordinate-free identity:
- diagonal delta kernel invariance under diagonal diffeomorphisms,
- Lie-derivative relation \(\mathcal L_{V_x}\delta_{\mathrm{diag}}=-\mathcal L_{V_y}\delta_{\mathrm{diag}}\),
- point splitting \(\to \delta'\) as the simplest derivative contact term.

## Scope
- Edit:
  - `papers/half-density-qft/main.md`
- Update logs:
  - `docs/research-log.md`
  - `cycles/index.md`
- No bibliography ingestion.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `papers/half-density-qft/main.md` Section 5 contains the Lie-derivative identity and explains it as the coordinate-free version of \(\partial_x\delta(x-y)=-\partial_y\delta(x-y)\).
2. The section links to:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-derivatives-of-diagonal-delta-kernel.md` (S18),
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-difference-quotients-counterterms-and-delta-prime.md` (S15) for the \(\delta'\) point-splitting limit.
