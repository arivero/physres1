# S50 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overgeneralization**: claiming ordering ambiguity is always "just measure choice".
2. **Confusion**: mixing the half-density factor for unitarity with the earlier path-space measure obstruction (different issues).
3. **Intro bloat**: adding too much to `Heuristic H0.2` damages flow.

## Mitigations
1. Explicitly scope the claim to the \(H=pq\) dilation witness.
2. Keep the two obstructions separate: (i) non-existence of Lebesgue measure on path space vs (ii) non-uniqueness of discretization/orderings.
3. If promoted, add at most a short clause ("unitarity selects symmetric ordering") to the parenthetical.
