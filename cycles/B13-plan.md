# B13 Plan: Bibliography inspection — Newton's polygonal limit consistency

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Identify and record the scholarly literature on the mathematical rigor of Newton's Proposition I (Book I, Principia) — specifically whether the polygonal impulse scheme converges to a continuous central-force trajectory.

## Target claims in manuscript
- Section 3.1 (line 136): "one constructs a piecewise-linear trajectory with impulses directed to a fixed center, then passes to a continuous curve by refinement [Newton1687]."
- Section 3.3, P1.1 (line 201): "If max_k Δt_k → 0 under consistent refinement, the finite-step law above yields dA/dt = |L|/2m for the limiting trajectory whenever the limit exists in the standard differentiable sense."
- Line 333: "Newton's polygonal proof is also strictly stronger in scope."

## Key question
The manuscript currently cites only [Newton1687] for this entire argument. Is this adequate? The scholarly literature contains a significant debate about whether Newton's limit argument is rigorous.
