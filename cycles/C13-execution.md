# C13 Execution

## Draft Deltas
1. Added `Derivation D1.1` (coordinate invariance of half-density pairing/composition) to `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
2. Added `Derivation D1.2` (dilation scaling makes the \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scale explicit).
3. Added `Derivation D1.3` (dimension match: \(d=4\) is singled out if the half-density normalization constant is built from gravity without fractional powers).
4. Added `Derivation D1.4` (stationary-phase/Van Vleck prefactor is a bi-half-density) to connect the half-density theme directly to the main paper’s stationary-phase narrative.
5. Added `Derivation D1.5` (inverse-square orbit radius + Planck areal speed \(\Rightarrow\) Compton radius cancellation) anchored to `[RiveroAreal]`.
6. Added an explicit hypothesis ledger + relaxation branches (Section 3.1–3.2) to separate what is forced by half-density geometry from what is imposed as a universality/selection principle.
7. Started explicit analysis of `H2.5` by separating “integrality vs perturbative analyticity” readings and adding a Diophantine dimension-sieve derivation (Section 3.3, `Derivation D1.6`).

## Sections Touched
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
2. `docs/research-log.md` (recorded the start of `C13`).

## Status
In progress: next step is to make the “universal area scale” claim sharper by stating explicit hypotheses (what background structure is allowed) and by clarifying how RG scaling interacts with half-density normalization.
