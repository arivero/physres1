# C13 Execution

## Draft Deltas
1. Added `Derivation D1.1` (coordinate invariance of half-density pairing/composition) to `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
2. Added `Derivation D1.2` (dilation scaling makes the \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scale explicit).
3. Added `Derivation D1.3` (dimension match: \(d=4\) is singled out if the half-density normalization constant is built from gravity without fractional powers).
4. Added `Derivation D1.4` (stationary-phase/Van Vleck prefactor is a bi-half-density) to connect the half-density theme directly to the main paper’s stationary-phase narrative.
5. Added `Derivation D1.5` (inverse-square orbit radius + Planck areal speed \(\Rightarrow\) Compton radius cancellation) anchored to `[RiveroAreal]`.
6. Added an explicit hypothesis ledger + relaxation branches (Section 3.1–3.2) to separate what is forced by half-density geometry from what is imposed as a universality/selection principle.
7. Started explicit analysis of `H2.5` by separating “integrality vs perturbative analyticity” readings and adding a Diophantine dimension-sieve derivation (Section 3.3, `Derivation D1.6`).
8. Ran `H2.3` explicitly: added `Proposition P1.3` + `Derivation D1.7` (scalarization is a choice of measure; changes of \(\sigma_\ast\) act by multiplication on scalar representatives).
9. Ran `H2.4` explicitly: added `Derivation D1.8` (flat/affine vs metric-derived vs field-derived reference half-densities) plus an “RG as scale dependence of scalarization” note (`Heuristic H2.11`).
10. Added `Derivation D1.9` (square-root delta normalization has half-density weight) to connect the “halved delta” construction directly to half-density scaling exponents.
11. Added `Example E3` (Yang--Mills coupling) as an explicit alternative “dimension sieve” inside the H2.5 Diophantine framework.

## Sections Touched
1. `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
2. `docs/research-log.md` (recorded the start of `C13`).

## Status
In progress: next step is to decide whether the delta-halving argument should be promoted (briefly) into `paper/main.md` as an additional motivation for half-densities, and whether to add a second alternative sieve (e.g. string tension / \(\alpha'\)) or stop at the gauge-coupling example.
