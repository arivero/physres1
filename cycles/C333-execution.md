# C333 Execution: Promote D63 stage-4 obstruction to cornerstone

Date: 2026-02-14

## Target
paper/main.md, Section 9.6 (after Remark P9.1)

## Sources
D63 (forced-completion stage 4)

## Changes
- Added Remark P9.1a (Stage 4: composition over dynamical geometry)
- Obstruction: A1 presupposes fixed temporal slicing; general covariance dissolves this
- Qualitative difference: domain failure (what is the slice?) vs integrand failure
- Chain may branch rather than continue linearly

## Diffstat
+3/-0 (net +3 lines). MARGINAL standalone.
Combined with C331 (+4) and C332 (+6): total +13 net manuscript lines.

## Productivity check (Rule 9)
- Net lines: 3 (below threshold standalone)
- Combined batch C331+C332+C333: 13 net lines (PASS)
- Status: MARGINAL (batched)

## Guard checks
- Cycle-tag leak: CLEAN
- conv_patched: CLEAN
