# C64 Execution: Promote Nonlinear-Validation Trigger

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5l` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` after D1.5k.
- Promoted a concise practical trigger: when pilot nonlinear-vs-linear uncertainty discrepancy reaches a few-percent scale, escalate to nonlinear uncertainty propagation for reporting.
