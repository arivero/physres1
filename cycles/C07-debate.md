# C07 Debate

## Claim
The final section should present one explicit compatibility-chain proposition rather than only narrative prose.

## Objection
A global proposition may overstate rigor by combining results from different mathematical settings.

## Resolution
State compatibility as simultaneous constraints under previously declared assumptions, not as a single theorem in one formal framework.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Transition stress-testing should be explicit and directional (`C01->C02->...->C06`).

## Objection
A transition list can become repetitive and reduce readability.

## Resolution
Use one compact derivation-style audit where each bridge has a named closure condition and one equation/invariant anchor.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
The manuscript must include a clear "proven vs heuristic" status map.

## Objection
Binary labels are too rigid for mixed-status sections.

## Resolution
Use mixed-status entries (`Proposition/Derivation/Heuristic`) with assumptions column, so scope boundaries remain precise.

## Status
Accepted.

## Claim
Residual vulnerabilities should remain in the paper, not only in cycle red-team files.

## Objection
Too many caveats can undermine narrative confidence.

## Resolution
Keep vulnerability list concise and pair it with a concrete next-paper agenda.

## Status
Accepted.
