# C125 Debate

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Should the conclusion explicitly mention the 2D delta model as the witness, or is "RG-D1.2a" sufficient?

## Resolution
Sufficient. The conclusion is for broad summary; the reader who wants specifics follows the label to Section 5.2. Naming the 2D delta model in the conclusion would be redundant with the preceding text (it's the only worked model in Section 5).
