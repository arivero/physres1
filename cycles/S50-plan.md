# S50 Plan: Control-Map View of the \(H=pq\) Ordering Family

## Goal
Interpret the \(H=pq\) time-slicing family from `S49` in "control map / equivalence" language:
identify which parts are genuine physical choices and which parts correspond to choosing a representation (measure/half-density) so that composition is unitary.

## Tasks
1. Relate the constant-term ambiguity in \(q\partial_q + c\) to Jacobian/half-density factors for dilations.
2. Show that the symmetric choice \(c=\tfrac12\) yields the unitary dilation group on \(L^2(\mathbb R_+,dq)\).
3. Record a promotion suggestion for `C77` (tighten the H0.2 witness phrasing accordingly) if warranted.

## Acceptance Tests
- A clear statement: "ordering ambiguity can encode a choice of measure/half-density; unitarity selects the symmetric convention" (for this toy case).
- No overclaim that all orderings are equivalent in general.
