# S168 — Debate

**For:** Subtracted dispersion relation Π(q²)−Π(0) is standard (Peskin & Schroeder §7.5).
KK relations follow from analyticity + crossing; optical theorem ties Im Π to total cross-section.
**Against:** Remark may be tangential to the paper's contact-limit focus.
**Resolution:** Brief remark adds value — connects UV structure to dispersive physics without derailing narrative.
