# Q34 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overinterpretation:** readers treat E4a as asserting confinement universally in 4D gauge theory.
2. **Branch leakage:** E4a blurs the boundary between H2.5 and H2.13 if not explicit.
3. **Bibliography gap:** remark invites requests for supporting references.

## Mitigations
1. Keep "often / when defined" style language (already present).
2. Keep explicit "logically places ... in H2.13 unless assuming \(\alpha_\ast\)" statement.
3. Add bibliography only when expanding beyond the one-remark clarification.
