# Q65 Plan: Referee pass on C110

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Verify that the C110 citation addition (Nauenberg 2018 added to H1.2) is correct, consistent with the manuscript's citation format, and that both bibliography entries accurately support the claim.

## Checklist
1. Claim accuracy: does the cited material support "precisely the symplectic Euler integrator"?
2. Citation format: does `[Key1] [Key2]` match the manuscript's convention?
3. Bibliography entries: correct metadata (author, title, journal, year, DOI)?
4. Side effects: any unintended changes to surrounding text or cross-references?
5. Guard checks: already run in C110 — verify no regression.

## Allowed files
- Read: `paper/main.md`, `paper/bibliography.md`
- Write: `cycles/Q65-*.md`
