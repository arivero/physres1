# C296 Plan: Package B deeper extension witness (self-adjoint domains)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Goal
Strengthen Package B beyond symmetry checks by adding an explicit self-adjoint extension/domain-parameter witness for a kinetic operator.

## Target manuscripts
- `paper/main.md` (yes)
- `papers/<name>/main.md` (no)

## Scope
In scope:
- Add a 1D kinetic-operator extension example showing same symbol, different self-adjoint domains, and distinct spectra.
- Tie this explicitly to representation/domain compatibility in Section 10.2.
- Update Package B status line.

Out of scope:
- Full U(2) extension classification details.
- New bibliography ingestion.
- Companion-paper edits.

## Acceptance criteria
- At least one new numbered derivation/proposition in Appendix 10.2.
- Domain-data role is explicit and mathematically scoped.
- Diffstat recorded in `cycles/C296-execution.md`.
- Guard checks pass.
