# S122 Plan
Date: 2026-02-13

## Objective
Study the Uehling potential (vacuum polarization correction to the Coulomb potential) as a concrete example of the fermion-loop mechanism described in Section 3.1 of the fermionic mediators satellite.

## Approach
1. Blackboard: derive the Uehling potential integral, its short/long-distance limits, and the connection to local operators.
2. Subagent review by a QED specialist.
3. Promote as Example 3.2 in the fermionic mediators satellite (C163).
