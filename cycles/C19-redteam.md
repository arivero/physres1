## Failure Modes to Watch
1. Confusing spectral quantization (finite volume) with “quantization of the theory” (operator algebra / path integral).
2. Overstating generality: the cleanest statement is for 1D Sturm–Liouville problems and point interactions.
3. Losing the RG thread: the point is that fixed points are *scale-invariant boundary data*, and scale invariance yields simple quantization conditions.
