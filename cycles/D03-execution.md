# D03 Execution: Foundations-Journal Hardening via Explicit RCP “Compatibility Diagram”

Date: 2026-02-11

## Decision
- Chosen target: make RCP explicit as an operational compatibility/closure diagram with one toy-family witness.
- Why now: it sharpens the manuscript’s central novelty claim (“laws survive controlled refinement”) into a checkable statement without adding new bibliography debt.

## One-sentence novelty claim (non-manuscript)
RCP can be stated as a closure/commutation requirement on a family of prediction maps under three explicitly defined operations (partition composition, representation change, and scale comparison), and this requirement can be exhibited in a toy family where the closure fails if conventions are inconsistent.

## Scope disclaimer (non-manuscript)
- This is not a categorical formalization program; the target is a one-page operational diagram plus one concrete witness.
- No new BV/BRST, no new path-space measure constructions; stay within the manuscript’s existing conceptual stack.

## Updates made
- `docs/research-log.md`: record completion of Theme K pipeline (`B10/C89/Q47`) and open this D03 target.
- `docs/research-state.md`: refresh date and note that Themes K/L now have dependent notes; set “next action” to `S63 → C90 → Q48`.
- `docs/next-articles.md`: optional pointer update for the new dependent note (if helpful).

## Spawned cycles
- `S63`: write a blackboard note “RCP as a compatibility diagram” with one toy-family closure equation + copyable promotion block.
- `C90`: promote the block into `paper/main.md` (RCP appendix section) and rebuild PDF.
- `Q48`: referee pass on `C90`.
