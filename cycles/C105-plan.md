# C105 Plan: Promote symplectic-Euler remark + Berkeley citation

Date: 2026-02-12

## Goal
Two promotions bundled into one wave:
1. Add Berkeley (1734) citation to Section 1 (Zeno-style refinement paradox sentence).
2. Add Heuristic H1.2 (symplectic-Euler identification) after H1.1a in Section 3.3.

## Target manuscripts (must edit >=1)
- `paper/main.md` (yes)

## Scope
In scope:
- One sentence addition to Section 1 (Berkeley citation).
- One paragraph (H1.2) in Section 3.3 (symplectic-Euler identification from S69).

Out of scope:
- Full Section 8 bridge (deferred; would need more technical machinery on symplectic B-series).

## Allowed files
- `paper/main.md`
- `cycles/C105-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`, `docs/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Both additions in paper/main.md. Diffstat recorded. Guard checks pass.
