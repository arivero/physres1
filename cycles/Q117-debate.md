# Q117 Debate: Four-remark review

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- All physics content correct across all four remarks.
- Systematic gap: in-text citations without formal bibliography entries.
- This is a known pattern in the satellite papers — many remarks cite works by name without formal [key] entries.
- Requires a dedicated B cycle to add ~10 reference entries.
