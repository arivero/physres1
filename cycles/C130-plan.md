# C130 Plan: Fix repo language and metadata in fermionic-mediators

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle (required)
- `Q85`: referee pass found repo language and empty metadata.

## Goal
Fix two issues for Tier 1 readiness:
1. Replace 3 instances of "repo" language with generic academic phrasing.
2. Fill YAML metadata (author, date).

## Allowed files
- `papers/fermionic-mediators-contact-limits/main.md`
- `papers/fermionic-mediators-contact-limits/main.tex` (rebuild)
- `papers/fermionic-mediators-contact-limits/main.pdf` (rebuild)
