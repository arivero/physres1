## Failure modes
1. Over-claiming universality beyond central power-law setting.
2. Duplicating existing remarks without added structure.

## Mitigations
1. Keep claim local to high-momentum fixed-\(L\) asymptotics for power-law attraction.
2. Promote only if manuscript wording explicitly distinguishes this rule from the separate \(q=2\) dimensional identity.
