# S135 Red Team: Decoherence

Date: 2026-02-13

## Checks
1. Coherent states as pointer states: Correct (Zurek, Habib & Paz 1993).
2. Avoided imprecise timescale formula (reviewer flagged (n-m)² as wrong).
3. Attribution corrected to 1993 PRL (not 1981).
4. Coupling dependence caveat omitted from remark (too detailed for ~3 sentences).
