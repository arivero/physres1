# Q32 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Misread inevitability:** readers infer "QM is forced" as theorem.
2. **Reader overload:** three-item list adds too much conceptual overhead too early.
3. **Mismatch:** items promised but not delivered later.

## Mitigations
1. Keep "heuristic" and "in practice" language.
2. Keep list short and plain.
3. Ensure later sections explicitly address each item (already true in current draft structure).
