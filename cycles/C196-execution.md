# C196 Execution: Promote Gutzwiller trace formula

Date: 2026-02-13

## Actions
1. Inserted Remark 7.4 before References section.
2. Content: Gutzwiller trace formula g_osc ≈ Σ_γ A_γ cos(S_γ/ℏ - μ_γ π/2), periodic orbits as non-integrable generalization of EBK, amplitude ∝ T_γ/|det(M_γ-I)|^{1/2}, divergence at torus orbits → EBK limit, spectral statistics bridge (Berry-Tabor from incommensurate actions, BGS from exponential orbit proliferation), Selberg trace formula as exact version.
3. Built PDF: 10 pages, 164 lines (+2).
