# B17 Red Team: Bibliography failure modes

## Failure modes

- **Pourciau2003 remains PENDING indefinitely**
  - Risk: low. The citation in H1.1a is non-load-bearing (it provides a counterpoint to Nauenberg2003KeplerArea, not a foundational claim). The manuscript's P1.1 hedging ("whenever the limit exists in the standard differentiable sense") is self-contained and does not depend on Pourciau's specific analysis.
  - Mitigation: if a referee requests the reference, it can be obtained via Springer institutional access.

- **Nauenberg1994SymplecticNewton remains PENDING**
  - Risk: medium, since H1.2 currently cites it for the symplectic integrator claim.
  - Mitigation: the 2018 paper (now added, with OA) makes the same claim more explicitly. A future C cycle should add it to the H1.2 citation, after which the 1994 paper becomes a historical supplement rather than the primary anchor.

- **UCSC Emeriti link for Nauenberg2018 might go stale**
  - Mitigation: the arXiv preprint `1810.05264` is a permanent anchor. The UCSC link is a convenience; the arXiv version is the durable OA copy.

- **The 2018 AJP paper might differ from the arXiv version**
  - Mitigation: both were checked and describe the same result. The AJP DOI is the canonical reference; the arXiv is the OA anchor.
