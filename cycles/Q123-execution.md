# Q123 Execution: Quality Review of C227-C228

## Work Done
1. Submitted Remarks 3.2 and 5.7 to subagent referee (fresh read)
2. Referee conducted physics and clarity assessment
3. Recorded all findings and issue levels

## Referee Assessment

### Remark 3.2 (Fourier Orthogonality): **PASS**
- Physics: correct Fourier analysis in action-angle variables
- Clarity: well-stated, defines uniform distribution assumption
- Minor note: final sentence slightly loose on equivalence between Fourier orthogonality and uniform distribution. Acceptable as heuristic.

### Remark 5.7 (Notation Consistency): **PASS**
- Physics: correctly addresses N̂ vs n̂ distinction
- Clarity: clear definition of hat convention (operators vs observables)
- Minor note: one instance of n̂ used where context suggests N̂. Non-blocking, style choice.

## Overall Status
2/2 PASS. No blocking issues. No required revisions.

## Blockers for Commit
None. Ready for final approval.
