# S38 Debate: Is the Trigger Really "Few-Percent" Universally?

## Question
Should D1.5l present a fixed discrepancy threshold, or explicitly tie it to uncertainty regime?

## Current Resolution
Use discrepancy as the operational trigger, but state clearly that:
- the crossing point depends on covariance scale and correlations,
- "few-percent" is a practical baseline, not a universal constant.
