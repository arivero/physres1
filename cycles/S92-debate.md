# S92 Debate
Date: 2026-02-13
## Hard question
Should we add MORE than 2 cross-references? The satellite has 22 unique elements.
## Resolution
No. The cornerstone must remain self-contained. The HD-D1.3 precedent is one specific cross-reference per satellite. Two is already generous. Each cross-reference should point to a *complementary* derivation (alternative route to same result or explicit witness of a stated property), not to "more detail" which would make the cornerstone feel incomplete.
