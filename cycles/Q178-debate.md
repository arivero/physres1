# Q178 Debate: Is C295 too small to justify a cycle?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Was this hardening too small for a full C-cycle?

## Recommendation
Borderline but acceptable because it directly addressed a referee readability gap flagged in Q177 and improved verification traceability in Appendix 10.6.
