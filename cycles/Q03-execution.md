# Q03 Execution

## Review Target
`paper/main.md` Section 5.5 (Derivations D3.5 and D3.5a) after `C30`.

## Findings
1. **Concise and coherent:** D3.5a is short and reads as a direct clarification of the already-present \(\delta(\nabla f)\) and “square-root delta” scaling in D3.5.
2. **No overclaim:** D3.5a only states a standard distributional identity under explicit nondegeneracy assumptions, and only compares weights with stationary phase (no “delta limit theorem” claims).
3. **No further edits needed right now.** The multi-dimensional determinant story is better kept in notes/blackboards until `B02` is unblocked (modern semiclassical anchor).

## Action Queue
1. `B`: `B02` remains the main external blocker (DNS/network).
2. Optional `C`: once `B02` is available, consider adding a one-sentence pointer near D4.3 to `paper/notes/van-vleck-schur-complement.md` (if it improves referee-friendliness).

## Status
Completed.
