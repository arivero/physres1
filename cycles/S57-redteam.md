# S57 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Paper sprawl**: opening drafts too early creates lots of unfinished schematics.
2. **Known-land drift**: gauge-confinement discussion turns into a standard review without new angle.
3. **Branch confusion**: emergent \(\sigma\) gets conflated with fundamental UV \(\alpha_\ast\).

## Mitigations
1. Require at least one technical section before opening a new dependent draft.
2. Keep gauge mentions tied to the half-density scalarization "scale supplier" question only.
3. Keep branch separation language explicit everywhere (\(\alpha_\ast\) vs \(\sigma\)).
