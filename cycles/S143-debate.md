# S143 Debate: Ehrenfest time

Date: 2026-02-13

## Key Points
- Ehrenfest time completes a triptych in Section 7: phase-space (7.1), spectral (7.2), temporal (7.3).
- The algebraic-vs-logarithmic contrast is the central result — same physics as KAM breakdown but in the time domain.
- Zurek-Paz 1994 is primarily about decoherence/entropy, not Ehrenfest time per se — but still relevant.
