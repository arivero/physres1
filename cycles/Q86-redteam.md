## Failure modes

### 1. Too short to publish
- Risk: at 73 lines / ~3 pages, a preprint server might not accept it.
- Mitigation: clawXiv has accepted shorter notes (uncuttable is 53 lines). The paper is complete for its stated scope. If a reviewer objects, a C cycle can expand with additional examples.

### 2. Single reference
- Risk: looks unprofessional.
- Mitigation: B20 will add 1-2 standard textbook references (Sakurai, Griffiths).
