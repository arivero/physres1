# C208 Debate: How much topology to include in Remark 5.4

Date: 2026-02-13

## Question
Should the remark explain the topological origin (non-simply-connected configuration space) or just state the AB phase result?

## Decision
State the result and note it is topological in origin; defer the full π₁ argument to a possible future section.

## Rationale
The action-angle paper audience knows the AB effect; a brief topological flag suffices without a homotopy digression.
