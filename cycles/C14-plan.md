# C14 Plan

## Goal
Turn `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` into a technically anchored follow-up: “RG is fundamental” supported by at least one explicit computation.

## Scope
1. Choose one explicit model (toy QFT, singular QM, or 0D QFT) and compute a nontrivial beta function.
2. Make semigroup vs group structure precise in the chosen example.
3. Add one explicit rooted-tree bookkeeping demonstration (even if at toy level) tying to the cited tree/Hopf-algebra sources.

## Risks
1. Picking a model that forces new unavailable sources or too much machinery for a short note.
2. Overloading the paper with analogies instead of one clear computation.

## Acceptance Tests
1. `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md` includes one labeled derivation producing an explicit \(\beta(g)\).
2. Scheme dependence is stated cleanly (what changes vs invariant content).
3. The rooted-tree connection is illustrated with one concrete identity/recursion.
