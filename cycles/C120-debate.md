# C120 Debate: Promote S82 free-propagator computation into planck-area Section 4

Date: 2026-02-13

## Hard question
Does a worked free-particle example add value to Section 4, or does it just restate PA-D1.4 with trivial Van Vleck?

## Resolution
It adds value because:
1. PA-D1.4 shows the Van Vleck prefactor *transforms* as a half-density. PA-D1.4a shows the d/2 exponent is *required* by semigroup composition — a stronger statement (necessity, not just consistency).
2. The three-way cancellation makes the mechanism explicit: two d/2 from kernels, one from Gaussian volume. This is not obvious from the abstract transformation law alone.
3. The tangent-groupoid connection (ε = ℏt/m ↔ ε^{-d/2}) links PA-D1.2a to Section 4 concretely, closing a gap that Open Problem #1 identified.

The example is flat-space, which is a limitation (see S82-redteam.md), but it is a concrete model witness — the next step toward Open Problem #1 resolution.
