# D24 Debate: Is “\(\delta(\delta S)\)” ever meaningful?

Date: 2026-02-14

## Question
Can the manuscript safely use the informal slogan “\(\delta(\delta S)\)” to mean “support on stationary paths”, or does that inevitably invite category errors (distribution products / nonexistent path-space measures)?

## Working answer
It is meaningful as a mnemonic only if immediately replaced by a regulated statement (mollifier probing in finite time, or stationary-phase asymptotics in a controlled finite-dimensional approximation). Otherwise it invites the false impression that a literal delta-functional exists as a measure on path space.

## Next check
Write an explicit regulated substitute that matches the finite-dimensional stationary-set identities, and state the failure mode (Schwartz impossibility / diagonal singularities) that blocks naive extension.
