# C302 Debate

Date: 2026-02-14

## Hard question
Does this remark over-detail the functional analysis for a derivation that's meant to be a simple ordering witness?

## Current resolution
No. The remark is concise (4 sentences) and adds essential precision. D4.1b establishes the α-discretization family; D4.1c answers the natural follow-up question "which α should we use?" The symmetry-defect formula is explicit and checkable, and the domain discussion prevents a common error (confusing symmetry with essential self-adjointness). The level of detail matches other technical remarks in Section 6.
