# Q70 Debate: Is "dimension-permissive" the right framing for transmutation?

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
PA-E5a says transmutation "does not sieve dimensions" because it "supplies a scale in any d where a marginal coupling exists." Should this be stated more carefully, noting that not all theories in all dimensions have marginal couplings?

## Recommendation
The current phrasing is adequate. The qualifier "where a marginal coupling exists" is already present and correctly limits the scope. Adding further caveats would clutter the remark without adding precision — the reader already knows from PA-E5 that the 2D delta is the specific witness, and the structural point (transmutation ≠ dimension sieve) is clear. No change needed.
