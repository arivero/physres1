# C315 Execution: Initial Rooted-Tree Bookkeeping Paper Draft

Date: 2026-02-14

## What was created
New satellite paper: `papers/rooted-tree-bookkeeping/main.md` (269 lines, 5pp compiled)

## Structure (6 sections)
1. Introduction (motivation, scope, relation to companion work)
2. Rooted trees and B-series (Butcher foundation)
3. Worked example: midpoint RK2 (composition test, tree interpretation)
4. RG counterterm recursion (one-loop template, BPHZ placeholder)
5. Dictionary table (7 entries, literal vs analogy distinction)
6. Outlook (symplectic/Ward, Hopf antipode, two-loop extensions)

## Key content
- Midpoint method B-series (promoted from S297 blackboard slot 0)
- Dictionary table: B-series ↔ counterterms, grafting ↔ subdivergences, order ↔ renormalization conditions
- **Critical distinction:** Butcher group (reversible) vs RG semigroup (one-way)
- Connection to companion paper: RG as composition-compatibility condition

5 refs: Butcher 2016, Hairer/Lubich/Wanner 2006, Connes/Kreimer 1999, Kreimer 1999, [Main]

## Expansion path
Current: 5pp (below 6pp PLB limit, well below 9-13pp PRD target)
Next steps:
- Add two-loop RG example (Section 4.4, ~1-2pp)
- Add symplectic RK + Ward identity worked example (Section 6.1 expansion, ~1-2pp)
- Expand Hopf algebra formalism (Section 6.2, ~1pp)
Target: 9-10pp PRD length

## Guard checks
- ✓ No cycle IDs in manuscript
- ✓ Complete structure (all 6 sections)
- ✓ Substantive content (not template-only)
