# S06 Execution

## Work
- Wrote a hypothesis-hygiene blackboard note clarifying that H2.5a (“integrality/monomial sieve”) is coordinate dependent unless one fixes an admissibility rule, and that H2.5b (“analyticity at a base point”) is the more invariant reading under analytic reparametrizations.
- Proposed an explicit tentative admissibility rule (Rule A) excluding scheme parameters (\(\mu\), cutoffs, finite-subtraction constants) and scalarization gauges from the “coupling set”.
- Recorded how adding \(\Lambda_d\) or \(\alpha'\) changes the dimension-sieve outcomes while keeping the half-density facts fixed.
- Kept dimensional transmutation as a separate scale-supplier branch (outside H2.5b).

## Result
- New note: `blackboards/2026-02-10-h2-5-coupling-admissibility.md`.
- Promotion candidates listed at the end of the note.

## Status
Completed.
