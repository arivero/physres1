# S167 Red Team: Aharonov-Bohm study failure modes

Date: 2026-02-13

## Failure modes
- Sign error in the phase formula from inconsistent charge convention:
  - Mitigation: state e>0 convention explicitly in the remark.
- Overcomplicating the remark with non-abelian or relativistic generalizations:
  - Mitigation: restrict scope to U(1) gauge, non-relativistic ring.
