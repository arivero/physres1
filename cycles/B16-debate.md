# B16 Debate: Another paywalled Springer reference

Date: 2026-02-12

## Question
Nauenberg (1994) is Springer-paywalled. Should we invest effort in acquisition?

## Decision
Not now. The citation is for attribution (scholarly credit), not for extracting technical content. The symplectic identification is rederived independently in S69. PENDING status is acceptable.
