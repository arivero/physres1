# D05 Plan: Update Durable Logs + Queue Submission-Readiness Referee Pass

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Record the completed finishing/hardening waves in durable docs, then queue the next action that directly improves foundations-journal readiness of the main manuscript.

## Completed items to log
- `B11`: acquired GREEN-OA copy for `[Feynman1948]` (Caltech repository); `[Dirac1933]` still pending.
- `C92`: removed internal `PENDING` process metadata line from `paper/main.md` and rebuilt PDF.

## Next action candidates
1. `Q49`: referee-style submission-readiness pass on the current `paper/main.md` (parent: `C92`), focused on reader flow + claim hygiene.
2. `B12` (optional): one more OA attempt for `[Dirac1933]` via alternative lawful repositories (time-capped).

## Allowed files
- `docs/research-state.md`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `docs/next-articles.md` (optional)
- `cycles/D05-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Durable docs updated with the latest cycle completions.
- Exactly one next target chosen and specified (default: `Q49`).
