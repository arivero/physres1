# C57 Debate: Does D1.5e Add Too Much Relativistic Formalism?

## Question
Could the new invariant-limits remark distract from the half-density/Planck-area core?

## Current Resolution
Keep it concise because it prevents misinterpretation:
- D1.5e explains why D1.5d still needs source-timelike structure;
- it closes a loophole (“just use Lorentz invariants of \(M^{\mu\nu}\)”);
- the remark is short and mathematical, not a new branch expansion.
