# S95 Execution: Fermionic mediators paper expansion assessment
Date: 2026-02-13

## Finding
The paper's line 54-55 claims "fermions can and do affect effective interactions through loop effects" but gives no concrete example. Vacuum polarization in QED is the standard, most referee-safe example: closed fermion loop modifies photon propagator → momentum-dependent coupling → local operators at low q.

## Recommendation
Add Section 3.1 (vacuum polarization example) between the obstruction statement and the IR replacement section. ~15 new lines. Connects naturally: loop corrections at low energy produce the local operators of Section 4.
