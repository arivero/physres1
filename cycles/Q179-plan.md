# Q179 Plan: Referee pass on C296 self-adjoint extension witness

Date: 2026-02-14

## Parent cycle (required)
- `C296`: Package B extension witness (`D9.1f`, `D9.1g`)

## Goal
Referee-pass C296 for mathematical correctness and scope discipline.

## Allowed files
- `cycles/Q179-*.md` only

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- `blackboards/`, `paper/notes/`, `notebooks/`
- `paper/bibliography.md`, `sources/`

## Checklist
- Domain condition and bound-state formula are coherent.
- Claim remains witness-level, not full extension classification.
- Package B status line matches added content.

## Acceptance criteria
- PASS/FAIL and one concrete next recommendation.
