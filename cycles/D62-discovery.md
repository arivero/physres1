# D62 Discovery: How does P4.2 compare to operational uniqueness theorems for QM?

Date: 2026-02-14
Parent: D53 (single-axiom P4.2)

## Novelty target
Compare P4.2's "composition → QM" argument with Hardy/Masanes/Chiribella
operational uniqueness theorems. What does P4.2 offer that they don't?

## Comparison table

| Feature | P4.2 (composition) | Operational (Hardy et al.) |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Path integral (kernels, actions) | Operational (states, measurements) |
| Starting point | Composition semigroup | Probability axioms |
| Derives path integral? | YES (native) | NO |
| Connects to classical mech? | YES (action, κ→0 obstruction) | NO (CM is a special case, not starting point) |
| Extends to QFT? | YES (D54, mode decomposition) | PARTIALLY (algebraic QFT) |
| Identifies CM→QM obstruction? | YES (κ→0 failure, P4.2(vi)) | NO |
| Axiom count | 1 (composition) + setup | 3-5 axioms |
| What's "free data"? | Potential V(x) (D61) | Dimension of state space |

## What P4.2 uniquely offers

1. **Classical-quantum bridge**: P4.2 starts from the action (classical) and
   derives the path integral (quantum). Operational approaches start from
   probability theory and derive Hilbert space structure — they don't touch
   the classical→quantum transition.

2. **Inevitability narrative**: P4.2 shows QM is FORCED by composition of
   classical objects (action-based kernels). Operational approaches show QM
   is uniquely selected among operational theories — but they don't explain
   WHY nature chose this class.

3. **QFT extension**: The mode-by-mode argument (D54) extends P4.2 to QFT
   naturally. Operational QFT (AQFT) requires substantially more axioms.

4. **Single axiom**: P4.2 uses ONE axiom (composition) vs 3-5 for operational
   approaches. The setup conditions (ℝ^d, action, mass) are physical givens,
   not abstract axioms.

## Verdict
**P4.2 is complementary to, not competing with, operational uniqueness theorems.**
They prove the same thing (uniqueness of QM) from different directions:
- Operational: uniqueness among abstract theories
- P4.2: uniqueness as completion of classical mechanics

The P4.2 approach is more physically motivated and directly connects to the
project's thesis (forced completion chain). The operational approach is more
mathematically rigorous and framework-independent.

## Novelty assessment
**MINOR (comparative positioning).** The comparison helps place P4.2 in the
existing literature without claiming it supersedes operational approaches.
