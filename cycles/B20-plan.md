# B20 Plan: Add bibliography to both Tier 3 papers

Date: 2026-02-13

## Parent cycle (required)
- `Q86`: action-angle-indeterminacy needs 1-2 more refs.
- `Q87`: uncuttable-controlled-refinement needs bibliography from scratch.

## Goal
Add references to both papers in one pass:
1. action-angle: +1 ref (Sakurai2020).
2. uncuttable: +2 refs (BatesWeinstein1997, FeynmanHibbs1965), new References section.
Also fix uncuttable paths/repo language.

## Allowed files
- `papers/action-angle-indeterminacy-central-potentials/main.md`
- `papers/uncuttable-controlled-refinement/main.md`
- `paper/bibliography.md` (ledger entries 42-43)
