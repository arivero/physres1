# S42 Debate: Mention Schwinger-Keldysh by Name?

## Question
Should the promoted remark explicitly mention the Schwinger-Keldysh / closed-time-path formalism, or keep it kernel-structural only?

## Current Resolution
Keep the promoted remark structural and self-contained (kernel doubling on \(M\times M\)).
If we name Schwinger-Keldysh, do so as an optional aside and queue a dedicated bibliography cycle before expanding beyond a sentence.
