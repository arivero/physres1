# D19 Execution: Organize slow-cadence cycle queue for threshold thread

Date: 2026-02-14
Status: Completed

## Actions
1. Formalized a slower queue that prioritizes study cycles before any new content promotion.
2. Set explicit gate for optional `C300`: only after two additional study cycles produce a clear improved sentence over current `Remark P1.1a`.
3. Marked this thread as "stress-test first, promote later" to match requested back-and-forth depth.

## Outcome
- Cycle organization now matches the requested slower research cadence.
