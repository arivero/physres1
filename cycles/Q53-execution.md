# Q53 Execution: Referee pass on C96 half-density QFT hygiene

Date: 2026-02-11

## Parent cycle reviewed
- `C96`

## Findings
- Publication safety improved: repo-internal file paths (`paper/...`, `blackboards/...`) were removed without changing the mathematical content.
- The remaining “companion note” references are phrased in conceptual terms (not repo structure) and read as optional pointers rather than prerequisites.
- No new technical claims or bibliography debt were introduced.

## Required follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- None required.

## Optional follow-ups (spawn cycles)
- `C97` (optional): if this note is intended to stand fully alone, replace “companion Planck-area note, Derivation D1.2b” with either a brief inline derivation summary or a standard literature citation.
