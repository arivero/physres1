# C57 Execution: Promote D1.5e Invariant-Limits Remark

## Work Completed
- Added `Remark D1.5e` after D1.5d in `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
- Recorded the simple frame-free bivector invariants
  \[
  I_1=\frac12 M_{\mu\nu}M^{\mu\nu},\qquad
  I_2=\frac12 M_{\mu\nu}{}^\star M^{\mu\nu},
  \]
  and their circular-planar reduction \(I_1=-m^2c^2r^2\), \(I_2=0\).
- Stated the bounded conclusion: these invariants are insufficient to encode areal-rate branch data in this setup.
