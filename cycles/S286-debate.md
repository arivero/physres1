# S286 Debate: Two-particle composition test for κ universality
Date: 2026-02-14

## Key point of contention
Is the universality result actually new, or is it trivially contained in P4.2's assumptions?

### Position A: It is already implicit in P4.2
P4.2 assumes a single c₀ for the whole system. Applying P4.2 to a composite system with one Lagrangian automatically forces one κ. The "result" is just re-reading the assumptions.

### Position B: The two-case analysis clarifies scope
P4.2 is stated for a single system. The question of whether κ varies across *different* systems (particles, sectors) is not addressed by P4.2 alone. The tensor-product analysis shows that for decoupled systems, independent κ values are consistent. Only coupling forces universality. This is a genuine clarification of P4.2's scope.

### Resolution
Position B is correct. P4.2 proves necessity of κ *within* a given system. The universality *across* systems requires the additional physical input that systems interact. The two-case structure (decoupled vs coupled) is the right framing. The result is not a deep new theorem but a useful scope clarification that strengthens the paper's foundational narrative: κ=ℏ is universal because everything couples to everything (at least gravitationally).

## Subtlety: what counts as "coupling"?
Even indirect coupling suffices. If particle 1 couples to field A, and particle 2 couples to field A, then the combined system (1+2+A) has a single non-separable Lagrangian, forcing one κ. This is the transitivity argument. The only escape is a completely decoupled sector with zero interaction channels to anything else -- a "dark" sector in the strongest possible sense.
