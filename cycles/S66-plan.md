# S66 Plan: Step-doubling discrepancy and the first rooted tree (Euler)

Date: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Produce a concrete derivation/computation/check as a promotion candidate (no manuscript edits).

## Deliverable (keep bounded)
- Target: 1–2 pages deriving the first nontrivial “two half-steps vs one full step” discrepancy for explicit Euler, expressed as an elementary differential (rooted-tree order 2), plus a small symbolic check in a scalar model.
- Output file(s):
  - `blackboards/2026-02-11-euler-step-doubling-rooted-tree.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/`
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S66-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- A self-contained derivation/check with enough detail to be promoted by `C98`.
- Any commands run are recorded (command + output summary).
