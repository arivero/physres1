# S00 Debate

## Question
Is the “scale for scalarization” *physical*, or just a representational gauge choice?

## Notes
- If H2.3 is dropped (allow dimensionful scalar representatives), the “need for a universal scale” is largely conventional.
- If H2.3+H2.4 are imposed (dimensionless scalars + background-free constancy), the scale becomes operational: it must come from couplings or RG invariants.
- The bridge is strongest when we can exhibit an RG-invariant scale in a concrete model and show exactly where it would sit in the half-density formalism.
