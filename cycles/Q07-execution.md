# Q07 Execution

## Review Target
`papers/planck-area/main.md` around the H2.5/H2.7 ladder and Examples E1–E4 (gravity-only, \(\Lambda_d\), Yang–Mills, \(\alpha'\)).

## Findings
1. **Knobs are cleanly separated:** the draft does a good job distinguishing geometric half-density facts (H2.1), scalarization choice (H2.2–H2.3), background-free constancy (H2.4), and restricted coupling dependence (H2.5/H2.7), with transmutation treated as a separate branch (H2.13/D1.6a/E5).
2. **Gravity-only ⇒ \(d=4\) is correctly scoped:** Derivation D1.3 explicitly assumes \(G_d\) is the *only* admitted dimensionful coupling and forbids fractional powers; the conclusion is correctly framed as a sieve result, not an absolute statement about \(d=4\).
3. **\(\alpha'\) example is mostly well-framed:** Example E4 is already presented as an admissibility variant under the monomial sieve (integer powers), and it correctly notes that \(\alpha'\) selects \(d\equiv0\pmod4\) rather than singling out \(d=4\).
4. **Minor “herd risk” wording:** Example E4 starts from “In perturbative string theory…”. This is fine as a context sentence, but it can be misread as importing dynamics rather than treating \(\alpha'\) as a generic universal area parameter. Consider rephrasing to “suppose the UV theory admits a universal area coupling \(\alpha_\ast\) (e.g. string \(\alpha'\))” if we want maximal anti-herd clarity.

## Action Queue
1. `C`: optional micro-edit in `papers/planck-area/main.md` Example E4/H2.12 to (i) emphasize \(\alpha'\) as an admissibility knob (“universal area scale admitted”) and (ii) keep the “string UV completion” scaling relation explicitly heuristic/outlook.
2. `B`: only if string-UV completion scaling becomes load-bearing (beyond heuristic), ingest one authoritative anchor for \(G_d\) scaling with \(\alpha'\) and \(g_s\).

## Status
Completed.
