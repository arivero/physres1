# S61 Plan: EFT Contact Matching Witness (Constant Amplitude ↔ Delta Potential)

Date: 2026-02-10

## Goal
Produce one explicit, bounded derivation showing how low-energy local operators correspond to point-supported (delta / derivative-delta) interactions in coordinate space, suitable for later promotion into a new dependent note on fermionic mediators.

## Deliverable
- A single blackboard note with a copyable promotion block:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-fermionic-mediators-contact-eft-to-qm-match.md`

## Allowed files
- `blackboards/`
- `paper/notes/` (optional, only if needed)
- `docs/research-log.md`
- `cycles/S61-*.md`

## Forbidden files
- Manuscripts: `paper/main.md`, `papers/*/main.md`
- Bibliography ledger: `paper/bibliography.md`
- `sources/`

## Acceptance criteria
- Show, by Fourier transform, that a momentum-independent Born amplitude corresponds to a \(\delta(\mathbf r)\) potential (up to conventions), and that polynomial momentum dependence corresponds to derivatives of \(\delta\).
- Record a compact promotion candidate block that can be dropped into a later `C` cycle.
