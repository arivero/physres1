# D11 Debate: When is a micro-fix worth a new `C` cycle?

Date: 2026-02-11

## Question
Should we open a new content cycle (`C99`) for minor notation/formatting polish identified by `Q55`?

## Current position
Default “no”: bundle micro-clarifications into the next substantive promotion wave unless the ambiguity is likely to cause immediate misunderstanding downstream.

## What would change my mind?
- If the current wording predictably causes misreading of the analogy (e.g. readers confuse modified-equation “running” with Wilsonian coarse-graining).
