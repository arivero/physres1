# Q39 Debate: Keep the Divergence Toy in the Intro?

## Question
Does the derivative-as-counterterm parenthetical belong in the Introduction, or should it be moved later to avoid analogy confusion?

## Current Resolution
Keep it: it is one line, explicitly marked as a toy witness, and it makes the "divergence" item concrete without committing to a specific model.
