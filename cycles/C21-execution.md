# C21 Execution

## Draft Deltas
1. Added `Heuristic H2.14` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` clarifying what “\(d\)” refers to in the \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) weight (spatial vs spacetime vs other composition variables).
2. Added `Derivation D1.6a` to `papers/planck-area/main.md` giving the general RG-invariant scale construction from a beta function and showing how it can supply the half-density scalarization constant when H2.3–H2.4 hold and H2.5 is relaxed.
3. Rebuilt `papers/planck-area/main.pdf` and removed `.aux`/`.log` artifacts after successful generation.

## Status
Completed.
