# S51 Execution: Choose a Crisp Divergence/RG Witness for the Introduction

## Work
- Reviewed candidate "divergence" witnesses for `Heuristic H0.2` item 3.
- Selected the **toy calculus witness** ("derivative as counterterm subtraction") as the least distracting and most general:
  - it illustrates regulate/subtract/limit without committing the Introduction to a specific singular potential model.
- Anchor material already exists in:
  - `blackboards/2026-02-10-difference-quotients-counterterms-and-delta-prime.md`.

## Decision
Add a single short parenthetical to `Heuristic H0.2` item 3 in a `C78` cycle:
"(Toy witness: the derivative exists only after subtracting a \(1/\varepsilon\) divergence in the difference quotient.)"

## Next
- `C78`: apply the wording change in `paper/main.md` and record diffstat.
