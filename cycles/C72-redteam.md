# C72 Redteam: Failure Modes

## Failure Modes
1. **Overclaim:** implies confinement/string tension is universal or always present.
2. **Branch confusion:** readers treat \(\sigma^{-1}\) and \(\alpha_\ast\) as interchangeable without caveats.
3. **Bibliography debt:** hints at Wilson-loop lore without anchors.

## Mitigations
1. Use "often" and "when it exists" language.
2. State explicit logical placement: \(\sigma\) is an RG invariant in \(d=4\) when couplings are dimensionless.
3. Avoid diagnostics; treat remark as branch bookkeeping only.
