Created `blackboards/2026-02-13-von-mises-near-optimal.md`:
- Von Mises wavefunction: ψ ∝ exp(κ cos φ), c_m ∝ I_m(κ)
- Probability |ψ|² ∝ exp(2κ cos φ), so R = I_1(2κ)/I_0(2κ)
- Large κ: Var(L_z) ≈ ℏ²κ/2, 1-R² ≈ 1/(2κ)
- LHS/RHS → 1 (asymptotic saturation)

## Subagent Review (rigorous mathematician)
All 5 points CORRECT:
1. Fourier coefficients: standard Bessel generating function ✓
2. R = I_1(2κ)/I_0(2κ): crucial κ vs 2κ distinction properly handled ✓
3. Asymptotics: both Var(L_z) and 1-R² verified ✓
4. Ratio → 1: asymptotic saturation demonstrated ✓
5. Added value: YES, provides optimal contrast to Dirichlet kernel ✓
