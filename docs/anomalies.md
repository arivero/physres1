# Anomaly Register

This file collects unexpected results, unresolved tensions, and structural puzzles
encountered during cycle work. It is **not** a citable source.

Any cycle (S, B, C, Q, D) may add entries here. D-explore (DX) cycles must read this
file as input and either resolve, promote, or carry forward each open entry.

## Entry format

### <date> — <one-line summary> (source: <cycle ID>)
- **What happened:** <describe the surprise or tension>
- **Why it matters:** <what principle or thread does it stress?>
- **Status:** OPEN | PROMOTED (→ <cycle>) | RESOLVED (<one-line reason>)
