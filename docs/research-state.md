# Research State (Living Brief)

This file is the durable "working memory" for continuing research in this repo across context resets.
It is **not** a citable source and may reference `conv_patched.md` only as an idea log.

Date: 2026-02-09

## North Star (Current Paper)
- Manuscript: `paper/main.md` (publishable artifact).
- Thesis: physically meaningful laws are those that survive controlled refinement in partition/representation/scale (Section 10: Refinement Compatibility Principle, RCP).
- Structural spine: Newton polygonal refinement → action additivity/Noether → composition law → path integral → deformation quantization + renormalization as limit-control mechanisms.

## Hard Guardrails
1. Do not put cycle IDs like `C00` in rendered manuscript content (`paper/main.md`, generated `.tex`, PDF-visible text).
2. Do not cite `conv_patched.md` (or any chat transcript) as a bibliography source.
3. Prefer OA sources first; otherwise mark `PENDING` and rely on lawful local PDFs for ingestion.
4. Treat preprints (especially A. Rivero drafts) as idea guides; treat any preprint-only claims as heuristic until verified against independent sources.

## Operational Loop (One Session)
1. Pick one thread + one concrete question (keep scope ≤ 1–2 pages of derivation).
2. Record decisions/results in `docs/research-log.md`; put longer math in `paper/notes/`.
3. If an external claim matters, ingest/track its primary source:
   - update `paper/bibliography.md` (key + status),
   - add/refresh `sources/<...>.md` or `sources/pending-<key>.md`.
4. Promote only “stable” results into `paper/main.md` (or a new follow-up manuscript directory when needed).
5. Run consistency checks + rebuild the PDF when manuscript text changes.

## Active Threads (Pick One)
### 1) Main paper: RG as foundational compatibility
- Goal: strengthen the manuscript’s thesis that RG is the scale-compatibility condition forced by composed refinement when naive limits diverge.
- Typical deliverable: one additional explicit example/computation that goes beyond the current template-level RG discussion.

### 2) Planck area / half-density scale (follow-up draft)
- Draft: `papers/planck-area/main.md`.
- Goal: make precise why half-density normalization forces a \(\text{length}^{d/2}\) scale, and why in \(d=4\) this is naturally an area scale (candidate: Planck area), with at least one concrete model computation.

### 3) RG as fundamental (follow-up draft)
- Draft: `papers/rg-fundamental/main.md`.
- Goal: isolate the “RG is definitional” perspective, connect it to rooted-tree bookkeeping, and add one explicit beta-function computation in a model.

### 4) RCP as a standalone foundations note
- Goal: state RCP as commuting diagrams / equivalence relations with a minimal axiom list and a short library of worked examples.
- Seed roadmap: `docs/next-articles.md` (A).

### 5) Dirac-supported probes / corners / impulses
- Goal: a clean weak Euler–Lagrange + mollifier theorem + corner/jump conditions with one anchored model.
- Seed roadmap: `docs/next-articles.md` (B).

### 6) Ordering/discretization as equivalence class
- Goal: extend the simple \(f(q)p\) example to a richer symbol family and present ordering as a conjugation/gauge equivalence.
- Seed roadmap: `docs/next-articles.md` (C).

### 7) Rooted trees as bookkeeping (Butcher ↔ RG)
- Goal: make the rooted-tree dictionary the primary content; do one explicit computation on each side.
- Seed roadmap: `docs/next-articles.md` (D).

### 8) Renormalization: template → real computation
- Goal: pick one toy/QFT example and show the semigroup property + scheme dependence explicitly.
- Seed roadmap: `docs/next-articles.md` (F).

### 9) Paper closure / hygiene (deprioritized unless blocking)
- Close the `PENDING` acquisition gaps (`Dirac1933`, `Feynman1948`, `Connes1994`, `Landsman1998`) when they become blocking for revisions.
- Optional: switch to pandoc `[@Key]` citations + a `.bib` file if a formal reference list is desired (keep `sources/` out of git).

## Immediate Next Actions (Low Friction)
1. Add a dated entry to `docs/research-log.md` at the start of each session (even if work is exploratory).
2. When a derivation starts to stabilize, create a dedicated note in `paper/notes/` and link it from the log.
3. Keep `docs/next-articles.md` as the “topic backlog”; keep `docs/research-log.md` as the “what happened” record.
