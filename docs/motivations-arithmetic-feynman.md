# Research Motivations: Arithmetic of Feynman Integrals

This file lists what the project is trying to achieve. Read it at the start of
every session to orient work toward genuine research goals.

## Overarching Question

When a Feynman integral is evaluated, the answer is a *number* — but not an
arbitrary real number. It belongs to a tiny, highly structured subset: periods
in the sense of Kontsevich-Zagier (2001). At one loop you get rational multiples
of $\pi^2$ (equivalently $\zeta(2)$). At two loops, multiple zeta values (MZVs)
like $\zeta(3)$, $\zeta(5)$, $\zeta(3,5)$. At higher loops, periods of mixed
Tate motives over $\mathbb{Z}$, or occasionally periods of more exotic algebraic
varieties (K3 surfaces, starting at certain loop orders in $\phi^4$).

**Why these numbers?** The graph topology of a Feynman diagram controls which
period appears. The Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra tells you *how* to subtract
divergences; the arithmetic program asks *what remains* after subtraction.

This project pursues the arithmetic content of perturbative QFT — the number
theory, algebraic geometry, and motivic structure that governs the values of
Feynman integrals.

## Foundational Goals

### 1. The period map: graphs to numbers

Each Feynman graph $\Gamma$ with $L$ loops defines a period:

$$P(\Gamma) = \int_{\sigma_\Gamma} \frac{\Omega_\Gamma}{\Psi_\Gamma^{D/2}}$$

where $\Psi_\Gamma$ is the first Symanzik polynomial (sum over spanning trees of
products of edge variables), $\sigma_\Gamma$ is the coordinate simplex, and
$\Omega_\Gamma$ is the standard volume form. The graph hypersurface
$X_\Gamma = \{\Psi_\Gamma = 0\} \subset \mathbb{P}^{|E|-1}$ determines the
motivic content.

**Goal**: understand the map $\Gamma \mapsto P(\Gamma)$ — its kernel (which
graphs give zero period), its image (which periods appear), and how Hopf-algebraic
operations (coproduct, antipode, renormalization) act on the arithmetic.

### 2. The cosmic Galois group

Brown (2012) and Cartier (2001, "mad day's work") identified a group $\mathcal{G}$
— the motivic Galois group of mixed Tate motives over $\mathbb{Z}$ — that acts on
motivic lifts of Feynman periods. This "cosmic Galois group" organizes all MZV
relations among Feynman integrals.

**Goal**: make the cosmic Galois action explicit for specific families of graphs,
especially in gauge theories where Ward identities impose additional constraints.

### 3. Gauge cancellations and the Cvitanovic conjecture

Predrag Cvitanovic, as Toichiro Kinoshita's PhD student at Cornell (1969-1973),
computed 6th-order QED $g-2$ diagrams numerically. He later proposed the
"finiteness conjecture": gauge invariance causes massive cancellations among
individual diagram contributions, making the total vastly simpler than the sum
of parts. Kinoshita dismissed this as a "pet theory" (1995 letter), but errors
were subsequently found in Kinoshita's own numerical calculations (Aoyama,
Hayakawa, Kinoshita, Nio — 2007, 2017 corrections).

**Goal**: reformulate Cvitanovic's conjecture arithmetically. If each diagram
contributes a period, and gauge Ward identities relate diagrams, then gauge
invariance should impose algebraic relations *among periods*. The cosmic Galois
group might encode exactly these constraints. Can we prove that gauge
cancellations are *motivic* — i.e., that gauge-variant contributions cancel
not just numerically but at the level of motivic lifts?

## Key Players and Lineage

### Broadhurst-Kreimer (1995-1997)
First systematic observation that multi-loop $\phi^4$ integrals produce specific
MZVs, and that the *knot theory* of the diagram (link structure after
thickening propagators into tubes) predicts which MZV appears.

### Bloch-Esnault-Kreimer (2006)
Each graph $\Gamma$ defines a pair of algebraic varieties — the graph
hypersurface $X_\Gamma$ and a boundary divisor — and the Feynman integral is
the period of the associated mixed Hodge structure. Turned the mystery into
algebraic geometry.

### Brown (2009-2015)
- Proved all periods of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$ are MZVs (2009)
- Proved mixed Tate motives over $\mathbb{Z}$ are generated by MZVs (2012)
- Developed graph polynomial techniques for computing motives of $X_\Gamma$ (2015)
- Formulated the coaction principle: Feynman integrals decompose under
  a coaction that respects the Hopf algebra of graphs

### Panzer-Schnetz (2015-present)
- HyperInt: symbolic computation of Feynman integrals as iterated integrals
- Census of $\phi^4$ transcendentals through high loop order
- Identified first non-MZV period (K3-type) in $\phi^4$

### Cvitanovic (1973-present)
- Group-theoretic methods for Feynman diagrams ("birdtracks")
- *Field Theory* (Nordita Classics Illustrated, 1984/2008)
- Finiteness conjecture: gauge invariance constrains not just divergences
  but also finite parts

## Open Questions (prioritized)

### 1. What is the arithmetic of QED?
Almost all systematic work (Broadhurst-Kreimer, Brown, Schnetz census) has been
done in scalar $\phi^4$. QED is structurally different: it has multiple
propagator types (photon, fermion), spinor traces, gauge invariance. The basic
question — which periods appear in QED at each loop order? — is wide open.

**Concrete first step**: compute the motivic period of the simplest QED vertex
correction (one-loop triangle) and vacuum polarization (one-loop bubble with
fermion loop). These are known analytically; extract their motivic content.

**Status**: not started.

### 2. Do gauge Ward identities act on the cosmic Galois group?
Ward identities relate different Feynman graphs. If these relations are
compatible with the cosmic Galois action, then gauge invariance constrains
the motivic weight of the total amplitude beyond what individual diagrams
suggest.

**Concrete test**: at one loop in QED, the Ward identity relates vertex
correction and self-energy. Check whether this relation lifts to a relation
among motivic periods.

**Status**: not started.

### 3. Tree-level arithmetic upgrade
In the ODE setting (Butcher trees, Runge-Kutta), the "periods" are rational
numbers — Butcher coefficients $1, 1/2, 1/6, 1/3, \ldots$. When passing from
ODE trees (physres1's cornerstone) to QFT trees (Connes-Kreimer), the
arithmetic upgrades from $\mathbb{Q}$ to periods of mixed motives. Is there a
clean description of this upgrade as a functor between Hopf algebras?

**Connection to physres1**: the cornerstone proposition identifies ODE
renormalization and QFT renormalization as the same Hopf-algebraic structure.
This question asks: granted the coproduct is the same, what changes in the
*values*?

**Status**: not started, but conceptually well-posed.

### 4. Can HyperInt be extended to gauge theories?
Panzer's HyperInt works for scalar integrals in parametric representation.
Gauge theories require handling numerator structures (spinor traces, Lorentz
contractions). Is there a systematic parametric representation for QED/QCD
that feeds into the HyperInt framework?

**Status**: partially addressed in the literature (Lee-Pomeransky representation).
Needs systematic implementation.

### 5. Non-perturbative periods via resurgence
Resurgence (Ecalle, Dorigoni, Aniceto-Schiappa) suggests non-perturbative
contributions ($e^{-1/g^2}$) are related to perturbative periods via Stokes
phenomena. The Borel transform of the perturbative series has singularities
whose locations and residues are controlled by the same periods.

**Goal**: for a concrete model (e.g., QED in 0+1 dimensions, the Euler-Heisenberg
effective action), compute both the perturbative periods and the non-perturbative
Stokes data, and verify that they match via resurgence.

**Status**: speculative.

### 6. Brown's conjecture for $\phi^4$
All periods of $\phi^4$ at any loop order are conjectured to be mixed Tate over
$\mathbb{Z}$ (hence expressible as MZVs). Schnetz found apparent
counterexamples (K3-type periods) but their status remains subtle — they might
vanish or factor through Tate motives after accounting for symmetries.

**Goal**: settle this for a specific family of graphs, or identify the minimal
graph that genuinely requires a non-Tate period.

**Status**: active research (Brown, Schnetz). We can contribute computationally.

## Connection to physres1

This project is the arithmetic companion to the structural/algebraic work in
physres1. The relationship:

| physres1 | This project |
|----------|-------------|
| Connes-Kreimer coproduct (structure) | Period map (values) |
| Butcher trees = ODE renormalization | Butcher coefficients ∈ $\mathbb{Q}$ |
| QFT trees = UV renormalization | QFT periods ∈ periods of mixed motives |
| Cornerstone: same Hopf algebra | Question: same functor on values? |
| RG flow (dynamical) | Cosmic Galois action (arithmetic) |

The bridge question: **is the RG a motivic Galois action?** Cartier and Brown
have conjectured this. Making it precise for a specific gauge theory would be
a major result.

## Session Priority Rule

Open questions come first, in priority order. Computational exploration (building
tables, running HyperInt) is warmup; structural questions (motivic lifts, gauge
constraints, cosmic Galois) are the real targets. Never mistake computation
for understanding.
